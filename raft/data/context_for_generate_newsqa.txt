-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Comcast rolled out a Web-based on-demand television and movie service on Tuesday that gives customers access to more than 2,000 hours of television and movies . The move comes as users increasingly are bypassing their TV sets and heading straight to the Web -- both legally and illegally -- to watch their favorite shows . The service , named Fancast XFINITY TV -LRB- formerly called TV Everywhere -RRB- , is the biggest cable industry initiative to keep people from skipping traditional TV service in the United States . `` I watch TV online every day . I find it more convenient than my regular TV ... , '' Michael Heard , a self-employed computer repairman from Atlanta , Georgia , said via e-mail . `` I 'm usually watching TV on one window while reading e-mail or tweets on another . `` And also my time is important , so sitting down and watching a show at 8 or 9 p.m. is n't convenient . Online TV allows me to watch what I want when I want . '' Networks have tried for the past couple of years to find a way to reach Web-watching audiences by streaming content on their Web sites or making partnerships with Hulu , one of the larger online TV sites . Now , Comcast is hoping it can make a dent in the market by serving up premium content . It is available to all Comcast customers , so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service . Heard said he does n't expect to give up Hulu , though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast . Heard , trying out the site Tuesday after it went live , tweeted that he thought the service was `` awesome , '' and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of `` The Sopranos . '' `` The quality , it 's really clear and loads fast , '' he said , though he noted there were still some bugs in the product . Heard occasionally had to reload the site , and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on Hulu . The service is getting mixed reviews on Twitter , with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences . Some complained that high-definition videos , which are available on Hulu , are not available on Comcast 's service . Others complained about having to download a separate video player , the service not being compatible with the Linux operating system , and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers . Comcast hopes to wow customers even more in the future . In the next six months , after the service has gone through more beta testing , the company plans to open the service to a broader customer base . Customers will be able to access all content -- depending on the tiered level of service they subscribe to . Those not paying for HBO regularly , for example , wo n't be able to snag the newest episode of `` Curb Your Enthusiasm '' online . In addition to catching up with sites like Hulu and Clicker , Comcast executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that Tivo fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their DVR from afar . Executives said they hope the service would be available in about six months . To access the content , users simply need to log in with their Comcast e-mail address at fancast.com . The site is offering live online help , including help retrieving those addresses .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NASA wo n't have to maneuver the international space station to dodge a piece of debris from a Soviet-era satellite spinning around Earth , the space agency announced Monday . NASA says debris wo n't threaten the international space station , seen here from Endeavour in November 2008 . Mission controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston warned earlier that a piece of the Kosmos 1275 was to pass about 1/2 mile from the space station early Tuesday morning . But after further study , NASA determined no evasive action would be needed , said Paul Dye , flight director for the space shuttle Discovery , which is en route to the station . `` The latest tracking information showed it is outside of our area of concern , so the station is going to be right where we expected it to be , '' Dye told reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas . Discovery lifted off from Florida on Sunday for a scheduled docking at 5:13 p.m. ET Tuesday . The spacecraft is not threatened by the debris , said LeRoy Cain , the shuttle program 's deputy manager . The dimensions of the satellite debris were not known Monday . The object was expected to pass `` on the fringes '' of the 2 km-by-25 km-by-25 km -LRB- 1.25 mile-by-15 mile-by-15 mile -RRB- safety zone controllers monitor , Dye said . `` It 's a very low probability of hit -- less than one in 100,000 , '' he said . The space shuttle Discovery is currently headed toward the station for a scheduled docking Tuesday , but the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris , said LeRoy Cain , the shuttle program 's deputy manager . Last week , a piece of debris forced the space station 's current crew -- astronauts Mike Fincke and Sandy Magnus , and cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov -- to take shelter in its escape capsule , a rare close call for the orbiting platform , NASA said . That object , a chunk of metal from a satellite rocket motor used on an earlier space mission , was about 5 inches across , and moving at nearly 20,000 mph . It passed within 3 miles of the station early Thursday afternoon and was detected too late for the station to maneuver out of the way , controllers said . iReport.com : See , share your photos of launches and space Cain called the prospect of two close passes in less than a week a `` random '' occurrence , but said controllers have frequently had to maneuver around pieces of orbital junk . `` It 's part of the business , '' he said . `` It comes with the territory , and we 'll continue to do whatever 's necessary to avoid debris . '' CNN 's John Zarrella contributed to this report .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Decorating in the midst of a financial recession is not easy . But Thom Filicia , host of the Style Network 's `` Dress My Nest , '' author of `` Thom Filicia Style '' and former cast member of `` Queer Eye for the Straight Guy , '' insists that it can be done . `` Paint is very affordable . Pick a color that has life and personality , '' Thom Filicia says . `` I always tell people , ` Start with what you have . ' Work as much with what you have as possible , and then fill in where necessary , '' Filicia said . CNN recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best . CNN : When you walk into a room that you 're going to redesign , where does your mind first go ? Thom Filicia : I look at the layout , I look at the way the space is being used , and I try to figure out what the best use of the space is ; that it works really well , it looks good , that you 're getting the best views , you 're seeing the space , and that you 're getting through the space . CNN : And that 's focusing mainly on furniture ? Filicia : That really focuses on all the furniture . You want to look at where the rug is and where the sofa is and coffee tables and chairs -- just how the room works . Even if it 's great-looking stuff , it sometimes does n't look as good as it can look . CNN : What can people on a tight budget do to rearrange their living room and make it look better with what they have ? Filicia : Make sure that your furniture layout works . Make sure that the things you love to look at , you 're seeing . Make sure things are n't cluttered . Paint is very affordable . Pick a color that has life and personality . You could do an accent wall behind your sofa . You could use a low - -LSB- volatile organic compound -RSB- paint so it 's environmentally friendly . You can use inexpensive up lights . You put them on either side of a piece of furniture or behind a tree . You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall . And then plug your lamps into the Lutron dimmer , and you can dim the whole room . CNN : As far as accessories go , like flowers and pillows , where do you draw the line on too much or not enough ? Filicia : I like to keep things clean and straightforward . I think one floral arrangement is usually enough , or maybe a couple really small cute little ones . Pillows should function . You want to sit on a sofa and be comfortable . Start with three : one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right . Add a throw , a rug for underfoot . Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical . CNN : What are some common designing rules that people always tend to follow but that you can actually break ? Filicia : People think that dark walls make a room smaller . It actually makes the space bigger . All the corners recede , and it adds a lot of depth . Also , I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces . CNN : What 's the most common mistake that people make ? Filicia : People just do n't trust their instincts , and they 're not willing to take a risk . Have fun with it . It 's only decorating . People tend to go with beige and white just because they 're afraid or they do n't want to make a commitment . CNN : If someone had just enough money to do one thing in their room , what would you tell them to focus on ? Filicia : The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa , because it is really the anchor for the room . In a bedroom , the anchor piece is your bed . Start with your anchor piece , and that 's where you spend your most money . CNN : You have a new book out now , is that right ? Filicia : Yup , I have a book out right now , which is called `` Thom Filicia Style , '' and it 's a great book . It 's a lot of fun . It 's got a lot of great tips in it . It talks about my philosophy ; it talks about color and texture . It 's a very comprehensive book with case studies . CNN : Can you give us some tips for making a place eco-friendly on a tight budget ? Filicia : It 's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies , environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs . Also , just turning your lights off when you 're not in a room ; when you 're brushing your teeth not keeping the water running ; taking shorter showers . These are all really simple , easy ways that we can all help Mother Earth repair and heal and replenish itself .
WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- During the presidential campaign , then-candidate Barack Obama said that he hoped his administration would n't get hung up on matters of race . Judge Sonia Sotomayor , center , meets with staffers from the White House Counsel 's Office on Monday . But several Republicans have said recently that his nomination of federal Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court has made race an issue . Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called Sotomayor a racist . Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh called the president `` the greatest living example of a reverse racist , '' and said that he has picked another for the Supreme Court vacancy of retiring Justice David Souter . Limbaugh later equated Sotomayor to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke . At issue is what she said at the UC Berkeley School of Law in about her hope that `` a wise Latina woman would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life . '' One top GOP senator said he wants more than an explanation . `` I think she should apologize , but I do n't believe any American wants a judge on the bench that 's going to use empathy or their background to punish someone , '' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News . Democrats have said conservative reaction to the pick is over the line . `` She 's been called the equivalent of the head of the Ku Klux Klan by Rush Limbaugh ; she 's been called a bigot by other Republican leaders like Newt Gingrich . I want to give her an opportunity to answer these kind of people , '' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont , who chairs the Judiciary Committee that will conduct Sotomayor 's confirmation hearing . The ranking Republican on the committee , Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama , tried to turn down the heat over the weekend . Watch range of comments on Sotomayor and race '' `` We should not demagogue race . It 's an important issue in our culture and our country . We need to handle it with respect that it deserves , '' Sessions said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' on Sunday . GOP leaders have focused on Sotomayor 's appellate court decision against a mostly white group of firefighters who say they were discriminated against after a promotion test was thrown out , because critics said it discriminated against minority firefighters . But legal experts have said her full record on race is n't that controversial -- in 96 race-related cases decided by Sotomayor on the court of appeals , she and her fellow judges ruled against discrimination 78 times and agreed with the claims in 10 cases , according to Scotusblog.com . Sen. Mitch McConnell , who will meet with Sotomayor on Tuesday , told CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday that he could n't predict how long it will take for Republicans to examine her record . But CNN political analyst David Gergen said they risk putting themselves on trial in front of Latino-Americans . `` If they line up uniformly in hostility against the first Hispanic woman to the court , they risk paying a terrible price with the biggest and fastest-growing minority in this country , '' Gergen said .

Instrument ? Powering up iPhone ... These days , British singer Gary Go might reach for his iPhone before his keyboard when hammering out a tune . He says applications such as Chordica and Beatmaker allow him to compose material and provide instant accompaniment for those spontaneous moments when he feels the need for a good sing -LRB- during the interview , Go broke into song every five minutes -RRB- . Go 's gadget of choice even doubled as a `` fifth member of the band '' during his July performance in front of 70,000 at London 's Wembley Stadium . He hooked it up to an amplifier and tapped out drum beats on the little screen . Watch Go in action with his iPhone '' Luckily , he said , his `` mum ' `` did n't call him mid-show to tell him his dinner was ready . -LRB- `` That would be a bit embarrassing . Thank goodness for airplane mode . '' -RRB- While the iPhone might be a handy tool for musicians -LRB- a couple of months ago , I watched as rock 'n' roller Rhett Miller tuned his guitar using an app called Power Tuner -RRB- , Go says he 's still a fan of old-school methods . The Londoner used real instruments when making his self-titled debut album , out this week in the U.S. -LRB- Decca -RRB- .

Editor 's note : Bryan Batt , who plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano in the Emmy award-winning cable TV series `` Mad Men , '' has acted in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions , such as `` Sunset Boulevard , '' `` Beauty and the Beast , '' `` Jeffrey '' and `` Starlight Express . '' Batt , who is 45 , has been acting for 23 years . He spoke to CNN.com about being an openly gay actor . `` We have to work toward acceptance on all levels , '' says actor Bryan Batt , who is openly gay . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There was once a time when the revelation of one 's homosexuality in Hollywood was thought to be a career-killer . Now , out gays and lesbians such as TV host Ellen DeGeneres and pop singer Clay Aiken are featured on the cover of People magazine . There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before . But even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public , is coming out still a big deal ? To shed light on the issue , CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt , 45 , about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood . CNN : Has being openly gay affected your career ? Batt : I came from the stage ; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage . Being gay never really posed a problem . In the Broadway community , it 's always been a little more accepted . There 's something different with film acting and TV acting . You 're in someone 's home -- it 's more intimate . When I look at someone , I really do n't care about whom they 're sleeping with or what they 're doing . I 'm thinking they either have talent or no talent . But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people 's private lives . It 's still like high school . Batt plays both straight , gay roles '' CNN : When did you come out ? Batt : My real Broadway break was in `` Starlight Express . '' At that time , I was toying with -LSB- coming out -RSB- . It 's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be . I 've heard of people doing it in Hollywood . It 's a very sad and difficult choice . I think it 's a personal journey , and I think people on their own time will figure it out . Clay Aiken is still really very , very young ; he has to deal with his own issues . Thank God , when it was my time , no one was pushing me ; no one was trying to force me . It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother . It went wonderfully . My mother said , `` No matter what , you 're my son . I 'm going to love you . '' Not one of my family or friends turned their back on me . I was fortunate , but it was still a very difficult thing to do , and I was fearful . Afterwards , it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back ; all those years worrying for nothing . But not everyone is as lucky ; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families , which is criminal . Just this year , I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation , a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and can not afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization . I only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in `` Jeffrey , '' a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy . I said to myself , if I get this , I 've just got to sit down and talk with my family . My partner and I have been together 19 years , and that was the same time he told his parents . A good parent knows ; they love and accept . What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society . CNN : Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today ? Batt : It 's just like any prejudice , once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go . They 're not based on facts , just on stereotypes . I really think yes , there might be some homophobia in Hollywood , but it 's based on what will sell . Hollywood is a huge industry , a multibillion-dollar business . If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell , they will get cast . There are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove -LSB- of them -RSB- either through fear or through ignorance . We have to work toward acceptance on all levels . How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women 's movement ? And , still today , women do n't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job . CNN : What 's your view of the character you play , Salvatore Romano , in `` Mad Men '' ? Batt : The character basically is clearly gay to a 2007 audience , but no one in the world of 1960 is suspicious whatsoever . What a great role to play . This season , I 'm married . I get stopped all the time on the street , and I get asked , `` When is your character coming out ? '' What is he coming out to in 1962 ? I asked to get married this season . I thanked -LSB- series creator -RSB- Matthew Weiner , and he said , `` You asked . '' It provides another wonderful level to the character . That is what happened then and unfortunately still happens today . -LSB- In a recent episode , the `` Gold Violin , '' -RSB- the scene with my wife , it was just so poignant and painful , someone said to me that what she loved about the episode was that we clearly did love each other . We were like the gold violin , we were beautiful but we just did n't make music CNN : What would you like to see Hollywood do ? Batt : Continue to reward good work and put positive role models out there . The one thing about `` Brokeback Mountain '' -- it was a beautifully filmed and acted film depicting a tortured relationship . The reason I thought the movie was so great is people walked away thinking , `` Why could n't they just be together ? '' The more positive or interesting the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters , the better . They should show people who are living their good , healthy , responsible , productive lives as role models who just happen to be gay . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the subject .
LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Catherine Zeta-Jones is limbering up for her Broadway debut . Catherine Zeta-Jones will make her Broadway debut in Stephen Sondheim 's `` A Little Night Music . '' The Oscar-winning star of `` Chicago '' will appear alongside Angela Lansbury in a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical `` A Little Night Music , '' according to an announcement from the show 's producers . The production is set to open December 13 at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York 's theater district . Previews begin November 24 . Zeta-Jones will play the lead role of Desiree Armfeldt in the production directed by Trevor Nunn , with Lansbury cast as her mother , Madame Armfeldt . `` I 'm honored that Trevor Nunn and Stephen Sondheim asked me to make my Broadway debut in this beautiful production , '' Zeta-Jones said in a statement . `` I look forward to starting rehearsal with this extraordinary group of people and working with the incomparable Angela Lansbury , whose work I 've long admired . '' Lansbury returned the compliment , describing Zeta-Jones in a statement as a `` lovely young actress . '' The 83-year-old Lansbury first appeared on Broadway more than 40 years ago and has claimed five Tonys during her stage career . Her most recent Tony came this year for her work in the revival of the Noel Coward play `` Blithe Spirit . '' `` A Little Night Music , '' with music and lyrics by Sondheim and book by Hugh Wheeler , debuted on Broadway in 1973 . It 's based on the 1955 Ingmar Bergman film `` Smiles of a Summer Night .

'' The producers have not announced ticket prices for the revival . Tickets go on sale October 17 for the general public .
LAGOS , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Royal Dutch Shell said Tuesday that it may not be able to meet its oil supply obligations in Nigeria after an attack on its major pipeline . Heavily armed Nigerian rebels pose a constant threat to oil pipelines in the country . The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta -LRB- MEND -RRB- , a rebel group , said `` detonation engineers backed by heavily armed fighters '' sabotaged two of Shell 's pipelines early Monday . After a helicopter flyover of the area , Shell confirmed that parts of its large Nembe Creek `` trunk line '' were damaged , company spokeswoman Caroline Wittgen said . The company shut down some production `` to limit the amount of crude that will spill into the environment , '' she said . Hours later , it declared `` force majeure , '' a legal term meaning it could not meet its supply obligations in the region because of the attack . '' -LSB- Shell -RSB- is working hard to repair the line and restore production , '' Wittgen said . Nigeria is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States , and attacks by rebels have helped fuel the year-long spike in crude oil prices . It 's one of many factors pushing up the price of gas in the U.S. , where one in every 10 barrels of oil comes from Nigeria . MEND -- the largest rebel group -- has targeted foreign oil companies since 2006 . It has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers , typically releasing them unharmed , sometimes after receiving a ransom payment . MEND hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the delta , where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day . Its attacks on oil facilities have taken a toll . `` Anytime a pipeline is affected , anytime any production gets shut down , you see oil prices jump up one or two dollars a barrel just because there is no slack in the system , '' said Jim LeCamp , a senior vice president with RBC Wealth Management , which manages assets for wealthy clients worldwide . Exxon and Shell are two of several companies that have been extracting 2 million barrels of oil a day in Nigeria . Recent rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger Delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days . That decrease in production comes at a time of increased demand from oil-hungry regions such as China , Russia and Latin America . `` Anytime there 's a disruption there , it really affects the system , '' LeCamp said in a recent interview with CNN .
WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Terror attacks have spiked dramatically in Afghanistan and Pakistan as extremists in both countries strengthen their power and expand operations , according to a State Department report released Thursday . The number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan , like this bombing in April , has more than quadrupled from 2006 to 2008 . But the State Department annual terrorism report notes an overall decline in attacks worldwide and fewer attacks in Iraq . The attacks worldwide have decreased by 20 percent , with 30 percent fewer fatalities , said Russell Travers of the National Counterterrorism Center . The report says al Qaeda and its extremist supporters have moved across the Afghan border `` to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier , where they have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide , train terrorists , communicate with the followers , plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan . '' In Pakistan alone , the report says , attacks more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2008 , with a sharp increase in their `` coordination , sophistication and frequency . '' Last year there were 1,839 terrorist `` incidents , '' compared with 890 in 2007 , Travers said . The rise in violence has complicated the Obama administration 's effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries . The report says the largest number of attacks occurred in Pakistani provinces near the Afghan border , including Balochistan , the North West Frontier and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend Islamic law . It also notes the government 's inability to get a handle on the extremists . Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces , it says , `` the government of Pakistan 's authority in the area continued to be challenged . '' Ronald Schlicher , the State Department 's acting coordinator of counterterrorism , told reporters the Obama administration has `` real concerns '' that al Qaeda 's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States . `` We have a real sense that it 's happening , but we have imperfect knowledge of what they 're doing , '' he said . Pakistan 's military in the past week launched an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari . The deal , criticized by the United States , allowed the Taliban to implement Islamic law , or sharia , in the region in exchange for an end to fighting . The recent operations are part of the Pakistani army 's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions . The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan . As a result , the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan . The strikes have rankled relations between the two countries . Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters , communication equipment and night-vision technology as part of a U.S. plan to beef up the country 's counterterrorism efforts . President Obama told reporters Wednesday night that he is `` gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan . '' Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office , Obama said the United States has `` huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable '' and does n't end up a `` nuclear-armed militant state . '' After making two visits to Pakistan in less than three weeks , Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , is `` very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in Pakistan and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships ' inability to confront that threat , '' according to his chief spokesman . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have called Taliban gains in Pakistan an `` existential threat '' to the country . The State Department report notes the terrorist attacks in Mumbai , India , in November , attributing them to the Pakistan-based Kashmir terrorist group Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and to its fundraising subsidiary , amaat ud-Dawa . Although Pakistan has cracked down on some of the groups ' camps and made several arrests , the report warned of continuing tension between India and Pakistan . The report says Afghanistan is plagued by `` an insurgency that more and more relied on vicious and increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks , '' despite the efforts of NATO forces and the Afghan government . `` The anti-government insurgency remained a capable , determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority , '' the report warns . Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses , the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers `` remained undiminished . '' `` Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated , '' it says . `` Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan , along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking , have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities . '' Iran is also a source of training to the Taliban `` on small-unit tactics , small arms , explosives and indirect-fire weapons , '' the report says . `` Since at least 2006 , Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition , rocket-propelled grenades , mortar rounds , 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members , '' it says . While terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year , `` there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country , including a decrease in civilian casualties , enemy attacks , and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year , '' the report says . There were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008 , down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007 , Travers said . He added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009 , although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in April . Although the threat from al Qaeda in Iraq `` continued to diminish '' due to significant defections and a loss of both territory and funding , al Qaeda continued to benefit from safe haven in Somalia and has strengthened its North African operations , the report says . It notes a sharp increase in attacks by al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa . In Algeria , many of the attacks were blamed on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , whose tactics `` appeared to be influenced by -LSB- al Qaeda 's -RSB- experience in Iraq . '' The report also warns `` the security situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate during 2008 and was marked by a series of attacks against both Western and Yemeni interests , '' culminating in the September 17 suicide bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa that killed 18 . `` Recruitment for al Qaeda in Yemen -LRB- AQY -RRB- remained strong , and the use of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices -LRB- VBIEDs -RRB- and suicide vests indicated a high level of training , coordination , and sophistication by Yemen 's terrorist leadership , '' the report says . The report calls the government 's response to the terrorist threat `` intermittent and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected terrorists remained weak due to a number of shortcomings , including stalled draft counterterrorism legislation . '' Although a raid in August on an al Qaeda in Yemen cell in the country uncovered large number of weapons , the report warns the action `` did little to deter or disrupt other AQY cells . '' It was a month later that at least seven assailants dressed in Yemeni security-service uniforms attacked the U.S. Embassy with explosives and suicide vests , launching what the report calls a `` sophisticated and well-coordinated '' attack . The report says Iran `` remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism , '' including supporting terrorist groups such as Hamas , Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad , all of which opposed the Middle East peace process , as well as Iraq-based militants and the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan . It cites the Qods Force , an elite branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , as the regime 's `` primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad . '' `` Iran 's involvement in the planning and financial support of terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East , Europe and Central Asia had a direct impact on international efforts to promote peace , threatened economic stability in the Gulf , and undermined the growth of democracy , '' the report says . Schlicher also said that the United States is `` troubled by indications that the Iranians may be seeking to extend their influence into other parts of the world and expand its military ties into Latin America . '' The Obama administration has adopted a policy of engagement with Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Packing winds of 140 mph , Hurricane Jimena was approaching Baja California on Sunday as a Category 4 storm , forecasters said . A satellite image shows Hurricane Jimena off the coast of Mexico early Sunday evening . `` There 's a good chance this system could be a Category 5 in the next 24 hours , '' said Dave Roberts , a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami , Florida . As of Sunday afternoon , Jimena was about 270 miles -LRB- 440 km -RRB- south of Cabo Correintes , Mexico , or about 480 miles -LRB- 770 km -RRB- south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California , according to the center . The storm is expected to continue in a north-northwest motion and approach the southwestern tip of Baja California sometime early Tuesday . Jimena is the 10th named storm of the Pacific season . `` It started out kind of slow for the Pacific , '' said Robbie Berg , another specialist at the hurricane center . `` Now we 've had seven named storms form , and that 's pretty busy for August . I think it 's been a couple decades since we 've seen that many storms in August . '' There 's no reason for people in Southern California to panic , but they should keep an eye on Jimena , Berg said . `` There 's no watches or warnings in effect , but we would like residents and tourists in the area to monitor the progress of the storm , '' Berg said . `` We do expect it to maintain its major hurricane strength as it heads up into that area . '' Tropical Storm Kevin has also emerged in the middle of the Pacific Ocean . However , Berg said it is weak -- with winds at a mere 50 mph -- and is not expected to pose a serious threat .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Water pressure is restored and it is now safe to drink in a Baltimore suburb where a huge water main burst , sending torrents of muddy water coursing over neighborhood streets and down highway ramps , officials said . Muddy water envelops the community of Dundalk , Maryland , on Friday . Many were left without power . `` A bad situation is well in hand , '' Baltimore County chief executive Jim Smith said during a press conference Saturday morning . Crews were still at work inspecting homes and clearing water from flooded basements , he said , `` but the danger is over , the crisis is over . '' A prestressed concrete water pipe burst late Friday afternoon under a road in the suburban Baltimore community of Dundalk . The 72-inch-wide main was shut about two hours after it ruptured , Smith said . No injuries were reported , Smith said , and knee-high to chest-high water had been reduced to 4 inches . Resident David Johnson said he felt helpless as he stood outside his house and watched the dirty brown water creep up his lawn and approach his front door . It stopped , inches away , and his basement stayed dry . The worst part now is the sewage smell , he said . Local public works officials said at least 39 basements in the area were flooded . See water main break damage '' Shannon Woerner was at home in nearby Essex , Maryland , when he heard the news about the water main break and the call for boats . He loaded his kayak in his truck and headed to the scene . `` I just wanted to see if I could help , '' he said . Woerner said he delivered car keys and other items across flooded streets to people who could n't get to their homes . Mike Pell , 34 , watched the water slowly recede after the main was shut . Water covered the wheels of his pickup . `` My basement 's done , '' he said , pointing to his shoulder to show the height of the water inside . He and his fiancee had a bedroom in the basement . `` All of our clothes are ruined , '' he said . He managed to get his two children , ages 2 and 3 , to a dry area on the first floor of the house . `` Now I wonder who 's gon na pay for this . We do n't have flood insurance ; this area does n't flood , '' Pell said , shaking his head . Samantha Hansley , 21 , could only watch from a dry hill and wonder if her truck would survive the flood . It sat in 2 feet of water a block away . Hansley and her boyfriend had been driving out of the floodwaters when they stopped to try to help some stranded drivers . `` Our truck just died , '' she said . A manager at the Box and Save grocery store about a block away from the break said the entire parking lot was flooded . Cathy Geisler said customers were still in the store Friday afternoon when police arrived to tell everyone except for essential personnel to evacuate . `` We were still doing business , then the electricity went out and we escorted everyone out of the store , '' Geisler said . Aerial video from CNN affiliates WMAR and WBAL showed a collapsed roadway covered by torrents of water . Entire neighborhoods had flooded streets , and some residents were evacuated , authorities said . Eric Braughman , who lives on one of the flooded streets , said he had `` thought something was up '' with the water Thursday when his faucets discharged orange-brown water . `` My wife did n't give the baby a bath because it did n't look safe , '' Braughman said . Nearly 1,000 customers were without power , according to Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. 's Web site . The main break is part of a larger issue with failing infrastructure in many U.S. cities , said Kurt Kocher , a spokesman for Baltimore 's Department of Public Works . Kocher cited two other huge main breaks in the Maryland and Washington area that were started from the same type of pipe that burst in Friday 's incident . `` This is a national infrastructure crisis , '' Kocher said . CNN 's Alec Miran in Dundalk , Maryland , contributed to this report .
KIEV , Ukraine -- Serbian central defender Nemanja Vidic has convinced Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson that he should play in Tuesday 's Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev . Vidic clashes with Roma goalkeeper Gianluca Curci during the UEFA Champions League Group F match . The former Spartak Moscow player sat out Saturday 's 4-1 victory at Aston Villa after suffering concussion during the Premier League win over Wigan immediately before the international break . However , he has made a good recovery and will now partner Rio Ferdinand in the heart of the United defense . Injury-plagued French striker Louis Saha definitely misses the tie with a long-term knee problem and fellow casualties Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves also stayed behind . England striker Wayne Rooney , who scored twice against Villa and was also on target in England 's Euro 2008 defeat against Russia in Moscow last week , will partner Carlos Tevez in attack . A third successive victory after 1-0 wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma would virtually guarantee United a place in the knock-out stage . United flew to Kiev a day earlier than normal , taking their own chefs and dieticians with them . `` The travel is always the biggest worry in these situations , '' said Ferguson . `` Ukraine is further away than most other journeys around Europe . '' Senegal defender Pape Diakhate , Guinea forward Ismael Bangoura and Ukraine midfielder Taras Mykhalyk are expected to return for Dynamo , but former Tottenham forward Serhiy Rebrov is an absentee . Dynamo warmed up for Tuesday night with a 1-0 win over strugglers Zakarpattia on Saturday in the Ukrainian Championship . But Kiev are bottom of Group F after losing their first two games -- 2-0 at Roma and 2-1 at home to Sporting . Glasgow Rangers are without Jean-Claude Darcheville and Brahim Hemdani for their formidable home clash against Barcelona on Tuesday . Darcheville is still struggling with a hamstring problem while Hemdani misses the Group E tie in Glasgow with a groin problem that kept him out of the weekend 's 3-0 win against Celtic . UEFA Cup favorites Bayern Munich will probably have to do without midfielder Franck Ribery for their group game against Red Star Belgrade on Thursday . The French international hurt his thigh in Saturday 's 2-1 win at Bochum that saw Bayern extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga . E-mail to a friend
BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraqi forces detained the suspected leader of a terrorist cell network believed to be funded by Saddam Hussein 's eldest daughter , who is wanted by Iraqi authorities on terrorism charges , the U.S. military announced Monday . Raghad Hussein is currently living in Jordan under the protection of the royal family . The raid happened Sunday in Hussein 's hometown of Tikrit . It was carried out by Iraqi forces , advised by U.S. Special Forces , the military said . The network , believed to be funded by Raghad Hussein , has been `` linked to a series of attacks on coalition forces '' using rocket-propelled grenades and roadside bombs , the military said . `` These attacks have claimed the lives of numerous Soldiers and Airmen , '' a military statement said . Other leaders of the network have been detained in previous raids , the military said . The international police organization Interpol last year issued an alert to authorities across the world that Raghad Hussein is wanted by Iraqi authorities . The Iraqi government has issued an arrest warrant for the 38-year-old daughter of the late Iraqi leader on charges of inciting terrorism and crimes against life and health . Interpol -- based in Lyon , France -- issued a Red Notice in the case . That is a request to police anywhere to help track her down and extradite her to Iraq . She has been living in Jordan under the protection of the royal family . E-mail to a friend
WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly two out of three Americans approve of the job Barack Obama is doing as president , according to an average of the most recent national polls . President Obama is still being evaluated on how he does his job , CNN 's polling director says . In a CNN Poll of Polls compiled Thursday , 64 percent of those questioned in various surveys say they approve of how Obama is handling his duties as president . Twenty-eight percent disapprove . The president 's approval rating also stood at 64 percent in a CNN Poll of Polls compiled in January , just after his inauguration . `` Most polls have shown Obama getting fairly high marks on most of the issues he has handled so far , '' CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said . `` One exception has been the way he has handled government assistance to failing banks and automakers . His numbers on the federal deficit are also low in comparison to his approval ratings on the economy and foreign policy . '' So how does Obama compare to his predecessors in the White House around the 100-day mark ? George W. Bush stood at 62 percent in a CNN/USA Today Gallup poll in April 2001 , Bill Clinton was at 55 percent in a CNN/USA Today Gallup poll in April 1993 , George H.W. Bush stood at 58 percent in a Gallup poll from April 1989 , and Ronald Reagan was at 67 percent in a Gallup poll taken in April 1981 . Learn more about previous presidents ' approval ratings '' `` The hundred-day mark tends to fall during a period when Americans are still evaluating a new president . The danger period for most presidents comes later in their first year in office , '' Holland explained . `` Bill Clinton , for example , still had good marks after his first 100 days , but his approval rating had tanked by June of 1993 . Ronald Reagan 's approval rating stayed over 50 percent until November of his first year in office , but once it slipped below that mark , it stayed under 50 percent for two years . So Obama 's current rating certainly does not indicate that he is out of the woods yet . '' The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of three national surveys taken over the past week : Gallup Tracking , Pew and AP/GfK .
WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- People in big cities walk past them every day -- street performers , or buskers . Some are talented , some are not , and most are n't performing for a cause greater than themselves . But on Monday , 12-year-old Abby Miller was . Abby Miller sings for her friend Taylor Love outside Washington 's Union Station on Monday . She was performing outside Washington 's Union Station to help her 4-year-old friend , Taylor Love , who is suffering from cancer . Abby sat in front of the station with a couple of her friends , singing songs and strumming a guitar . Passers-by seemed to notice the girl 's singing talent , stopping to listen in the chilly weather , with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby 's feet . Abby said the money will help support Taylor 's family . A few more stopped to write messages on `` Love Notes , '' little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time . `` Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night , '' Abby said . `` Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her . '' Taylor has neuroblastoma , a cancer that affects the nervous system . According to her Web site , she is in remission , but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence . There has been little research on the illness , of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year . Mike Gillette , a family friend of both Taylor and Abby , brought the two girls together . While raising money and support for Taylor is important , he said , he thinks Abby 's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease . `` She really wanted to reach people all over the country , '' he said . Gillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia , New Jersey and Virginia , and estimates they 've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred `` Love Notes . '' Abby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend . Taylor 's mother , Aimee , said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor , the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter 's illness . `` I think it 's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter , who is 4 and wants to inspire other children , '' Aimee Love said . `` The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life . '' Taylor 's family said her treatments are terribly painful . But Abby said Taylor has enormous character . `` She 's the most happy girl in the world , which I think is just incredible , '' Abby said . `` She 's so much fun to be around . She 's a little 4-year-old girl but she 's got a heart of like a thousand grown adults . '' Aimee Love said her daughter feels the same way about Abby . `` It gives her someone to aspire to , someone to be inspired by , '' she said .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's a photo of the Jackson family on the cover of the September 24 , 1971 , issue of Life magazine . In it , Joseph and Katherine Jackson stand at the foot of a set of stairs , their star children -- known as the Jackson 5 -- arrayed behind them . The Jackson brothers , here in the 1970s , were driven to be great by their father , Joseph . They appear to be the all-American clan , gold records arranged behind them , the boys loose and smiling , the parents more awkward and serious in their demeanor . Over the years , that façade crumbled . The brothers bickered ; some made accusations of abuse . But the group remained tight-knit through crises , including Thursday 's tragedy , when Michael Jackson collapsed at his house and later died at UCLA Medical Center . The journey began with music in Gary , Indiana . Joseph Jackson , the patriarch , played in a short-lived band called the Falcons -LRB- no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett -RRB- in the 1950s . His primary job , however , was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel . Katherine Jackson , the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949 , tended to the couple 's large family : Rebbie , Jackie , Tito , Jermaine , La Toya , Marlon , Michael and Randy , all born between 1950 and 1961 . Daughter Janet arrived in 1966 . By that time , the three oldest boys -- Jackie , Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group , which Marlon and Michael eventually joined . Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he 'd found elusive . Joseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster . He drove his sons hard , forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity . He was n't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child , Michael . `` My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day , '' Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993 . He said his father also beat him : `` He was very strict , very hard , very stern . ... There 's been times when he 'd come to see me , I 'd get sick , I 'd start to regurgitate . '' He quickly said , imagining his father 's reaction , `` Please do n't be mad at me . '' Joseph Jackson disputed the word `` beat , '' but did n't question Michael 's account . `` I whipped him with a switch and a belt , '' he told the BBC in 2003 . He added , `` I never beat him . You beat someone with a stick . '' In a 2005 interview with CNN 's Larry King , Jermaine defended his father 's actions . `` We grew up like any other black family . You did something , you got your butt tore up , and it was n't tore up , it was just , you got a spanking , '' he said . `` I will say this . He kept us off of the streets . He kept us away from drugs . He kept us away from gangs and ... we 've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world . '' By 1968 , when Michael turned 10 , the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine . They 'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the `` chitlin circuit '' of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group . Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them `` the last big stars to come off my assembly line , '' according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site . The group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base , along with an animated TV show . But success took its toll , particularly when it was n't so easy to come by . In the mid-1970s , the band -- minus Jermaine , who 'd married Gordy 's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records , where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff . The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions , which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit `` Enjoy Yourself . '' `` It was a collaboration , '' Gamble said . `` They all participated in creating . Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians . '' Huff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting , complete with a `` fantastic meal '' cooked by Katherine Jackson . `` I 've got nothing but respect for the father , '' added Gamble . `` He 's a great man . He made something out of nothing . '' Even during that era , however , Michael was standing out . Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded . Going solo with Quincy Jones producing , as he did in 1979 , was the right move , Gamble and Huff said . The family dynamics kept changing as the siblings grew older . After Michael 's `` Thriller '' became the biggest album of all time , the brothers -- including Jermaine -- regrouped for a new album , `` Victory , '' and accompanying tour . But Michael , now the undisputed draw , disagreed with some of the tour plans and ended up donating his earnings to charity . Michael 's brightened spotlight boosted the careers of his siblings ; even Rebbie had a hit . But it was Janet who broke out with the most success , including the No. 1 singles `` Miss You Much , '' `` Black Cat '' and `` Again '' in the 1980s and '90s . With the increased interest in the Jacksons came tabloid scrutiny of the family 's every move . When La Toya appeared nude in Playboy magazine , the story made headlines . She later criticized Michael and was on the outs for several years . Jermaine put out a song called `` Word to the Badd , '' an attack on Michael , in 1991 ; he later changed the lyrics . Janet 's relationships were probed in detail , as were the brothers ' marriages . And Michael , of course , was seen as increasingly eccentric , his personality overwhelming his music . But for all their own bickering , the family closed ranks when a member was attacked . In 1992 , Jermaine co-produced `` The Jacksons : An American Dream , '' a TV miniseries based on Katherine Jackson 's memoir , which chronicled their rise to stardom . When Michael faced molestation allegations in the early '90s and was tried in 2005 , the family rallied around . `` The Jackson family was groomed to be a team , '' said Linda Johnson Rice , president and CEO of Ebony and Jet magazines ' Johnson Publishing and a longtime family friend . `` As you can see through their performances , they were always there for each other . '' In recent years , La Toya has appeared on the reality shows `` Armed and Famous '' and the UK `` Celebrity Big Brother . '' She originally had a scene in the forthcoming Sacha Baron Cohen movie , `` Bruno , '' but CNN confirmed the scene has been cut , `` out of respect for Jackson 's family , '' the studio told The -LRB- UK -RRB- Guardian . Jermaine , who converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Abdul-Aziz , appeared on `` Celebrity Big Brother '' in 2007 . Jackie runs a record label , Tito remains involved in the music business , and according to a 2008 article in the New York Post , Marlon and Randy have struggled financially . In the hospital emergency room Thursday , Randy and Jermaine were witnessed hugging and crying over their late brother . `` We 're a family , '' Jermaine told Larry King in the 2005 interview . `` We 're no different than any other family who has feuds and problems . ... But at the same time , we 're united , and we have a united front that is very , very strong , and it 's supported by God . `` My mother and father did a great job in instilling the morals and principles in us from the very beginning . We feel that with that , that 's all you need to go through life . '' CNN 's Alan Duke contributed to this article .
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Death sentences plunged this year and the number of executions continued a steady decline as a result of `` growing discomfort '' felt by many Americans on the application of capital punishment . Only 78 people were sentenced to lethal injection so far this year , the first time that number has dropped below 100 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 , according to a study published Thursday by the Death Penalty Information Center . Death sentences last year were at 112 , and have declined by nearly 75 % from 15 years ago , when more than 300 individuals were condemned . The center 's annual report also showed only 43 people were executed in 2011 , down three from last year , and a 56 % decline from 12 years ago , when nearly a hundred people were put to death . `` This year , the use of the death penalty continued to decline by almost every measure , '' said Richard Dieter , the executive director of the center , which opposes the death penalty . He said executions , death sentences , public support and the number of states with the death penalty all dropped from previous years . `` Whether it 's concerns about unfairness , executing the innocent , the high costs of the death penalty , or the general feeling that the government just ca n't get it right , Americans moved further away from capital punishment in 2011 . '' In January , the Illinois legislature voted to repeal the death penalty , replacing it with a sentence of life without parole . In doing so , Illinois became the fourth state in four years to abandon capital punishment . The death penalty has now been abolished in 16 states . In November , Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber halted a pending execution and declared that no other executions would occur while he was in office . `` I am convinced we can find a better solution that keeps society safe , supports the victims of crime and their families and reflects Oregon values , '' he said . `` I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer . '' But perhaps the loudest outcry was in Georgia , which executed Troy Davis despite serious doubts about his guilt and an international campaign to save his life . Thursday 's report said the Davis case exposed the deep concerns over the death penalty . `` In many ways the death penalty today resembles the system struck down in 1972 , when the -LRB- Supreme -RRB- Court could find no justification for the small number of death sentences and executions chosen arbitrarily from so many eligible cases , '' the report said . A CNN/Opinion Research Poll conducted in October found that for the first time in recent memory , more Americans favor a sentence of life in prison over the death penalty for murderers -- 50 % to 48 % . That 's not to say that Americans want to abolish the death penalty entirely . Other polls have shown majorities generally favor it , but CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said his analysis shows there is a difference between thinking the government should have the death penalty as an option and actually wanting to see it applied . The decline in the number who prefer the death penalty as the punishment for murder may be related to the growing number who believe that at least one person in the past five years has been executed for a crime that he or she did not commit . In 2005 , when a solid majority preferred the death penalty , 59 % believed that an innocent person had been executed within the previous five years . Now that figure has risen dramatically , to 72 % . Davis drew widespread support for his claims that an innocent man was being put to death , after federal and state courts had rejected his calls for a new trial . Since Davis ' conviction in 1991 , seven of the nine witnesses against him recanted their testimony , and no physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of a Savannah police officer . However , a federal judge concluded the death row inmate `` vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence . '' A Texas execution in July also attracted international attention . Mexican national Humberto Leal Garcia was convicted of raping and killing a 16-year-old girl . A world court found the state violated his rights by not giving Leal access to his home country 's consulate upon his arrest in 1994 , as required by an international treaty . U.S. and Mexican officials , along with a variety of human rights groups , urged Texas to delay the execution , but to no avail . Texas continues to lead the nation as the busiest death penalty state , with 13 executions this year . Alabama was next with six , and Ohio with five . No more are scheduled until next month . Thirty-four states have capital laws , but only 13 states carried out that ultimate punishment in 2011 . In addition , several states with capital punishment laws did not sentence anyone to death in 2011 , including Indiana , Maryland , Missouri and South Carolina . Another high-profile murder convict in Pennsylvania saw his death sentence commuted . Prosecutors decided this month not to give Mumia Abu-Jamal a new capital sentencing hearing . He was convicted of murdering Philadelphia police office Daniel Faulkner , but has long claimed his innocence as a victim of what he called a racist criminal justice system . He will spend the rest of his life in prison . California voters could decide next year whether to abandon the death penalty . That state has the highest death row population -- 721 people -- but no one has been executed there since 2006 , when a court-ordered moratorium was declared . But one state that rarely has applied the death penalty could see two notorious killers receive that punishment . Steven Hayes was sentenced to death in Connecticut in December 2010 , and a jury this month recommended the same punishment for Joshua Komisarjevsky . They were found guilty of home-invasion killings that left a mother and her two daughters dead . State legislators had contemplated abolishing capital punishment , but these defendants may have caused some rethinking , to allow the practice for only the worst of crimes . Connecticut and New Hampshire are the only New England states with the death penalty , but only one person has been executed in the region since 1960 .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A two-time world lawn bowls champion has been banned from top-level competition and fined after being found guilty of match-fixing . Gary Lawson , one of New Zealand 's most successful bowlers with a joint-record 10 national titles , has been suspended for six months and fined $ NZ5 ,000 -LRB- $ 3,500 -RRB- following an incident at a tournament last year . It means he is likely to miss out on selection for this year 's Commonwealth Games in India . The New Zealand fours team , of which Lawson was the leader , was accused by Canada of deliberately losing a match against Thailand at the Asia Pacific Championships in Kuala Lumpur last August . New Zealand were defeated 17-15 , having already qualified for post-section play , and Canada alleged the Kiwis lost on purpose to earn a more favorable quarterfinal draw . The subsequent investigation has caused a furore in a genteel sport most often seen as a recreational pursuit for retirees . Lawson 's teammates Jamie Hill , Shayne Sincock and Shannon McIlroy were fined $ NZ1 ,000 each -LRB- $ 700 -RRB- but avoided a suspension . A Bowls NZ judicial committee laid the blame at the 43-year-old Lawson 's feet . `` He was the skip and was literally and figuratively calling the shots . We are satisfied that the idea to lose the 17th end would have come from him , '' it said in a statement on Wednesday . `` From what evidence we have , it is our opinion that once the Canadian complaint was referred to it , Bowls NZ not only proceeded with due expedition with the only course available to it but also was at pains through its counsel to provide all other requirements in a timely manner . `` The delays that occurred subsequently were to a very large degree brought about in an effort to make sure that the respondents , at each stage of the proceedings , were not denied natural justice . '' Lawson , who won two world titles on home soil in 2009 , last month blamed Bowls NZ chief executive Kerry Clark for blowing the incident out of proportion . `` The Canadians needed to beat Thailand otherwise they were going to miss out on the quarters . When it did n't happen , they put a protest in . But it was always an informal protest and they did n't want it to go further , '' he told Radio Sport . `` Kerry Clark turned up the next day , and he 's the guy who pushed it -- he pushed it at World Bowls level with coach Dave Edwards , and at the end of the day it got blown way out of proportion . `` This is about Kerry Clark himself -- he does n't like me and I think he has n't done a very good job . It 's just a shame he 's used this to have a crack at me . ''
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A professor who compared some victims of the al Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center to Nazis was fired Tuesday by the University of Colorado 's Board of Regents . Professor Ward Churchill wrote that some 9/11 victims were `` little Eichmanns . '' Ward Churchill raised hackles with a 2002 essay that argued the September 11 , 2001 , attacks were a justified reaction to U.S. policies in the Middle East , and said the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania had `` the courage of their convictions . '' But the regents said Churchill 's firing was unrelated to the essay , which went largely unnoticed for three years . Instead , it cited `` deliberate and repeated research misconduct . '' A university investigation had found cases of plagiarism and falsification in previous papers by Churchill -- allegations that surfaced after his essay became widely known . `` The Board of Regents affirms that its decisions in this matter have been made solely on the basis of the allegations of research misconduct against Professor Churchill and have not been influenced or motivated by extrinsic considerations , Professor Churchill 's political and social views or a desire to punish Professor Churchill for expression of his political or social views , '' the university announced . CU interim Chancellor Phil DiStefano recommended Churchill 's dismissal in June 2006 after a university committee completed its investigation . Churchill 's essay drew little notice until a 1,800-student college in upstate New York invited him to take part in a 2005 forum on prisons and Native American rights . The invitation was rescinded after criticism from then-New York Gov. George Pataki , then-Colorado Gov. Bill Owens and hundreds of relatives of those killed in the attacks created a media firestorm . The piece had called some of those who died in the World Trade Center `` little Eichmanns '' -- a reference to Adolf Eichmann , the Gestapo officer who was one of the chief architects of the Holocaust -- arguing they were `` a technocratic corps at the very heart of America 's global financial empire . '' Churchill , who had tenure , stepped down from his post as head of CU 's ethnic studies department amid the flap but remained on staff . He had no immediate reaction to Tuesday 's decision .

ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Genarlow Wilson , freed last week from a Georgia prison , said he 's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors , even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier . Genarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future . The 21-year-old , who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation , said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal . He had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day , he said Sunday . `` It might 've been lesser time , but then again , I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home , '' Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. `` I would n't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister . You know , when you 're a sex offender you ca n't be around kids . Basically , I ca n't even have kids myself , you know , so what is the point of life ? '' he asked . In 2005 , a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year 's Eve party . Wilson was 17 at the time of the party . Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal '' The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation . According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker , prosecutors in Douglas County , Georgia , offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record . Defense attorney B.J. Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he did n't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence . The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted , making such sexual encounters misdemeanors . However , the Legislature did not make the law retroactive , so it had no effect on Wilson 's sentence . Now 21 , Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man 's sentence `` constitutes cruel and unusual punishment . '' Wilson said Sunday he feels no `` negative energy '' toward District Attorney David McDade , who fought efforts to have Wilson 's sentence reduced . Instead , Wilson said , he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies . He wants to major in sociology , he said , `` because I feel like I 've been living my major . '' The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative , more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him , he said . `` When it seems like you have everything , you know , you feel like you have no worries until it 's all gone , and I know what it feels like to be without and I do n't want to ever feel like that again , '' said the former honor student , football star and homecoming king . `` I do n't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison , period . '' Though he called his sentence `` absurd , '' Wilson said he understands that prosecutors `` were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law . '' Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish . `` I was young then . I did some idiotic things in my teen years , but you know , every average teen does , '' he said . `` I do n't think any of us made very wise decisions , but I do n't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened .

New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the Occupy Wall Street movement grew and touched even more U.S. cities Saturday , the mayor of the city where it began blasted many involved and claimed they were targeting the nation 's financial sector and `` trying to destroy the jobs of working people '' in New York City . The protest effort continued into its 22nd day in New York on Saturday . Yet its spread well beyond that city , with its anti-corporation , anti-government message echoing in many places this weekend -- from Cleveland to Las Vegas , from Washington to Prescott , Arizona . Open Story : See iReports from the protests . Yet this growing fervor has been met , in some cases , by vocal commentary . That includes New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who in a WOR radio appearance Friday said that city 's labor unions -- many of whom swelled demonstrator ranks earlier this week -- depend on salaries that `` come from the taxes paid by the people they 're trying to vilify . '' The mayor did describe the city 's unemployment rate as `` unacceptably high , '' and acknowledged that `` a lot of people are disaffected . '' `` Some are legit , some are n't , '' Bloomberg said , describing the concerns of the demonstrators in Lower Manhattan . His comments coincided with the city 's announcement that 700 education workers will be laid off in an effort to close a budget gap . They also follow recently released census data that shows New York 's poverty level has increased to 20.1 % , the highest in more than a decade . The remarks drew criticism from Tyler Combelic , a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street , who claimed Bloomberg `` has n't really represented all of New Yorkers . '' `` The fact is there are thousands and thousands of us out on the streets , and he 's not really recognizing that we 're a movement , '' Combelic told CNN on Saturday . `` We should be heard by New York politicians . '' On Saturday , New York protesters set up a second base at Washington Square Park . The park in Greenwich Village is about two miles north of Zuccotti Park , a private park that 's been considered the main rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in the city . A rally was held in Washington Square , followed by a now-customary people 's assembly to discuss the movement and an art show Saturday evening . Demonstrators wo n't stay overnight at Washington Square Park , unlike Zuccotti , because it is a municipal park with a midnight curfew . As of 9 p.m. , the New York Police Department did not report any related arrests . The ambiguously defined movement against corporate greed and other social ills has spread to more than a dozen cities , spurred lately by support from unions and other groups . `` Social and economic inequalities are the tipping point , and people are hungry for getting involved and trying to do something to change it , '' Jim Nichols , who has been involved in Occupy Atlanta protests , told CNN on Saturday . `` It 's almost like , I want the American dream back . '' Even before Bloomberg 's comments Saturday , the effort was stirring a growing number of strong reactions from public figures . President Barack Obama , even as he defended the need for a vibrant financial sector , acknowledged that the protesters `` are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works . '' The No. 2 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives , Eric Cantor , meanwhile , slammed what he called the `` growing mobs '' who he claimed were `` pitting ... Americans against Americans . '' On Saturday , U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel backed the demonstrators -- whom he has been visiting regularly over the past three weeks -- for venting their frustrations and exercising their constitutional rights . `` Their dreams are being shattered , '' Rangel told CNN 's Don Lemon . `` They may be an inconvenience to a whole lot of people in that area , but people are going to sleep at night with an economic nightmare . '' The New York Democrat urged `` more spiritual leaders '' to join a movement he claimed championed the poor and disadvantaged , saying `` there 's no moral reason why they have to wait for something to catch on . '' He also dismissed criticism that the demonstrators do n't have a coherent purpose , saying despite their varied issues and lack of organization , their sentiments are raw and real . `` They do n't have to know what the solution is , '' he said . `` There 's one thing they know is -LRB- there 's -RRB- something wrong when so many people are out of work , and we find the disparity with the very rich . ... Something is wrong . '' Combelic , the New York spokesman , said the movement chiefly is trying to showcase `` active democracy and -LRB- show that -RRB- everyone has a voice in government . '' He said the protests -- which have been associated with progressive causes -- are `` a rebuke of government , that includes the left and the right . '' `` We 're trying to broaden the discussion base . ... We 're trying to represent 99 % of the country that 's felt disenfranchised over the past five years because of the recession , '' Combelic said . '' -LRB- Politicians -RRB- have not come together , they 've not compromised on anything , and there 's a reason why there 's -LRB- low -RRB- congressional approval in this country . '' The demonstrations have been largely peaceful . But in New York , some have been marred by scuffles with police . Last Saturday , police made hundreds of arrests as demonstrators marched without a permit toward the Brooklyn Bridge , blocking city traffic for hours . A week earlier , authorities detained dozens of protesters as they marched , also without a permit , through Manhattan 's financial district toward Union Square . CNN 's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report .
BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A German woman held hostage in Iraq since February has been freed , but her son was still being held , German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Wednesday . An image taken from a video issued in April shows Hannelore Marianne Krause and her son Sinan . The woman , Hannelore Marianne Krause , was taken to Germany 's embassy in Baghdad after being taken captive with her adult son 155 days earlier . Steinmeier said he was `` very relieved '' Krause was released on Tuesday , yet there still remains `` a great deal of uncertainty '' about her son , who `` remains in captivity . '' `` Rest assured we will do everything in our power to reach her son , Sinan , '' the foreign minister said . In early March , Iraqi militants holding Krause and her son hostage demanded that Germany withdraw its troops from Afghanistan to ensure their safety . As part of NATO 's Afghanistan force , Germany sent about 3,000 troops in the relatively peaceful northern part of the country . German troops also help train Iraqi soldiers and police , but not in Iraq . The Arrows of Righteousness group posted video clips on the Internet , threatening to kill the two in 10 days if Berlin did not comply . CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video . In it , the woman identified as Krause urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel to heed the demands . A passport with Krause 's name was shown in the video . While sitting next to her son , Krause tells Merkel , `` These people want to kill my son in front of my eyes , and then they 'll kill me , if the German troops did not withdraw out of Afghanistan . '' She and her son clutch each other and cry as they speak while three militants , two armed with large assault rifles , stand behind the pair . `` They are not joking , and they 'll kill us . I am very tired . Please help me . Take any decision or we will be killed . '' Reading a prepared statement , one of the militants says , `` We have warned you . Otherwise you will not see their bodies . '' `` Muslims are all one nation , and have one religion . It is not acceptable that Germany leads the coalition troops in Afghanistan , and attacks the secured villages and claim it is not fighting in Iraq .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roman Abramovich is seeking to buy back Chelsea 's home ground in order to switch to a new location that he hopes will help the English Premier League club remain competitive on an international scale . Stamford Bridge , which dates back to 1876 , once hosted a crowd of almost 83,000 people . But many decades since that 1935 landmark , its capacity is now only 41,841 -- having been converted into an all-seater venue in the safety-conscious 1990s . However , ownership of the stadium was given to a fans ' collective long before billionaire Abramovich bought the west London club in 2003 , in order to fight off the prospect it would again be bought by property developers . The terms of the deal which eventually sold Stamford Bridge to Chelsea Pitch Owners -LRB- CPO -RRB- in 1999 , a move that required a Â # 10 million -LRB- $ 15 million -RRB- loan from the club , meant the team can not keep its name if it relocates . Can football chants ever go too far ? `` We know only too well how close the club came to losing our home prior to the formation of CPO , but that threat has now gone under Mr. Abramovich 's ownership , '' Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck told the club 's website . `` And with the CPO structure in place , we can not plan with certainty for the future . I hope all shareholders vote in favor of the proposal . '' The CPO members will make their decision at a special meeting on October 27 that will have a massive bearing on Chelsea 's future plans . With the introduction of UEFA 's financial fairplay rules looming , Chelsea 's need to maximize revenue and become less dependent on the club 's Russian benefactor is growing . Premier League rivals Manchester United can entertain more than 75,000 fans at every home game , while Arsenal 's Emirates Stadium holds some 60,000 . Bigger grounds are seen as the way ahead , with Tottenham recently losing out to West Ham in a bitterly-contested bid to take over London 's new Olympic Stadium after 2012 . However , English clubs have some way to go before catching their European rivals . Barcelona 's Camp Nou has the continent 's largest capacity at almost 100,000 while Spanish rivals Real Madrid top 85,000 at the Santiago Bernabeu . Borussia Dortmund 's Signal Iduna Park is the biggest football ground in Germany with a capacity of 80,000 for domestic matches , while Bayern Munich 's Allianz Arena regularly brings in almost 70,000 . In Italy , the two Milan clubs can draw crowds of 80,000 -- though Juventus bucked the trend by moving to a smaller 41,000-capacity ground this season , leaving behind the unpopular 60,000-plus Stadio delle Alpi . Success in Europe 's biggest club competition , the Champions League , still eludes Abramovich despite the vast fortune he has pumped into Chelsea . A move to a new venue -- which would be within a three-mile radius of the club 's current home if completed by 2020 , under terms of the offer to the CPO -- would be a big statement of his desire to make Chelsea a worldwide force . `` I am sure all Chelsea fans have enjoyed the football and success we have witnessed at Stamford Bridge since 2003 , and Chelsea Football Club and Mr. Abramovich are determined to ensure that the club continues to compete at the highest level of world football , '' chief executive Ron Gourlay said . `` We continue to look at options for expanding the Bridge , and I should be clear that we have not identified a site for a new stadium elsewhere . '' Chelsea 's offer to the CPO 's 12,000 stakeholders is at the original price of Â # 100 per share -- an investment of Â # 1.5 million . `` Bear in mind that no-one bought these shares as a financial investment , '' Buck told the UK Press Association . `` Everyone bought these shares as a way of helping the club and they also bought them as mementos and souvenirs . `` We have n't considered making them a big offer because we believe that they are fans of Chelsea Football Club and want to do what 's best for Chelsea . '' On offer is a promise that 10 % of the planned minimum 55,000 seats will be available to families and fans aged under 21 . CPO shareholders who vote for the sale will be listed on a roll of honor at any new stadium , and would get priority for buying season tickets . The Chelsea Supporters ' Club , however , is not convinced that the club should leave its longtime home . `` Where is the proof that Stamford Bridge ca n't be expanded ? Undoubtedly many fans would prefer to stay , and I suspect loss of hotels/restaurants would not be a major concern for many , '' Peter T. wrote in a statement on its website . `` The ` walk of honor ' proposal is risible and insulting . Given that any new ground would be bigger , the ` priority season ticket ' offer is surely nebulous as well , as well as morally reprehensible . '' He also questioned why the vote had been called at such short notice , without any future venues being identified , and why the offer did not take into account inflation since the original 1993 CPO deal . Needing a 50 % majority approval from the CPO shareholders , Abramovich may yet find more obstacles in his dreams of world domination .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Barack Obama is sworn in as president January 20 , there will be music -- by , among others , Aretha Franklin , Yo-Yo Ma , Itzhak Perlman and the U.S. Marine Band . There will be prayers and speeches -- including Obama 's inaugural address . And for the fourth time in the nation 's 56 inauguration ceremonies , there will be poetry -- by someone far less well-known . Elizabeth Alexander says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle . After the president 's speech , Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion . Alexander is a 46-year-old Yale University professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of Obama 's . She joins three other poets who have read at inaugural ceremonies -- Robert Frost in 1961 for John F. Kennedy 's inauguration and Maya Angelou and Miller Williams , who read at Bill Clinton 's 1993 and 1997 inaugurations . Alexander has written five books of poetry , including `` American Sublime , '' a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005 . Her father is Clifford Alexander , secretary of the Army in the Carter administration , and her mother teaches history at George Washington University . Her brother is an adviser to Obama 's transition team . Alexander 's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from `` American Sublime '' -LRB- Graywolf Press -RRB- : Poetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner , overhear on the bus , God / in the details , the only way to get from here to there . / Poetry -LRB- and now my voice is rising -RRB- is not all love , love , love , / and I 'm sorry the dog died . Poetry -LRB- here I hear myself loudest -RRB- / is the human voice , and are we not of interest to each other ? Alexander spoke Friday to CNN.com . CNN : What do you think is the role of a poet in a ceremony like this ? Alexander : I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language , the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause , a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle . CNN : You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago ? Alexander : In the community in Hyde Park , he and Mrs. Obama were just people I 'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about , and we were of a generation . ... He was in the law school , and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work did n't really cross so much . ... -LSB- We were in -RSB- the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s , thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills , intellectual skills , skills in the discipline of law , in literature , artistic skills . That was the common ground , thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community . CNN : And you did it by writing ? Alexander : By writing and teaching . I 've been a professor for many years now , and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale . ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in . It 's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years . CNN : We have this historical moment , the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King , the inauguration of the first African-American president . How does that resonate with you ? Alexander : It 's amazing , is n't it ? I just shake my head and say , `` Is n't that something ? '' The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president . At the same time , this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation 's history . I ca n't tell you how many older people have said to me , `` I never thought I 'd live to see this day . '' The fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there 's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us . CNN : What 's ahead of us ? Alexander : Oh my goodness , so much . There are wars or conflicts in many different places , there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places , there 's the tremendous challenge of the economy . ... The larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are , if not post-partisan -- because I do n't think there 's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions . Within our communities large and small , making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we 're going to have to do in order to make things better . CNN : Can poetry help in that regard ? Alexander : I do believe that it can . The way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful , because after all if we ca n't be precise with language , how can we share ideas ? Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions . You can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem , but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it , those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems . CNN : So you 're going to write a poem about health care ? Alexander : That would be fun . Of course , this -LSB- poem for the inauguration -RSB- is an occasional poem , it has to serve the moment , it has to serve the day , right ? So those are the challenges of writing something that makes sense at this moment on this particular day . But of course , what I hope to do , rather than the laundry list poem , is to find language that will hopefully have a little resonance after the day is done . CNN : Will you show it to anybody before you read it ? Alexander : I show it to my husband -LSB- artist Ficre Ghebreyesus -RSB- , and he is my first , last and best critic . CNN : You wrote an essay about Gwendolyn Brooks -LSB- the Pulitzer Prize-winning African-American poet -RSB- in which you said that `` the pressure on creative work can be intense for artists who belong to groups still struggling for their fair shake in society . '' And then later on you said you 've seen your work `` overpraised by narrow-minded white critics '' and `` criticized small-mindedly by more than one black woman elder poet -- the same poets I imagined would be pleased by it . '' Your work is read very differently depending on who 's reading it ? Alexander : I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day , demographics does n't really tell you about how your work is going to be received . ... On the one hand , I have devoted much of my work to African-American culture . That 's my group , that 's who I am , -LSB- I 'm -RSB- proud and unambiguous about that -- but at the same time , one of the really great discoveries of a life in poetry has been that poetry is quirky . It reaches people unexpectedly . You really , really ca n't predict who is going to connect with various aspects of your work . That 's been a real gift to me ; it 's made me try not to assume too much about who thinks what and who is able to gain something from work . CNN : You have two children ? Alexander : Two sons , 9 and 10 . CNN : How do they feel about the poem ? Alexander : They are so excited , and that 's of course a lovely thing . And in the excitement , we still live in our every day , so mommy is still mommy , and all the mommy things are expected of me , and that 's the way I like it . CNN : What are your tastes in music ? Alexander : Jazz is the music that I know deepest and love the most , and I mean jazz across the board because that 's an incredibly diverse art , and also I must say , R&B , funk and soul speak very powerfully to me . CNN : Favorite artists ? Alexander : Thelonious Monk is quite a favorite artist . Marvin Gaye , John Coltrane , and also the breadth and accomplishment over a career of Duke Ellington . CNN : And Aretha Franklin ? Alexander : Can you imagine ? I get to hear her at close range . Boy , that 's going to be my gift for the year .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One video showed the tiny face of the slain girl wrapped in a shroud . Someone pulled back a bandage to show her bloodied right eye . Her mouth was frozen , slightly ajar . Her vacant face and lifeless head conjured the image of an alabaster bust . Another more gruesome video showed the girl before she was cleaned for burial . She lay sprawled on a pavement , bloodied and disheveled , like a crime victim caught in a tabloid snapshot . The images surfaced Sunday and Monday in Syria , where more than 2,000 people have died in five months of bloody conflict between security forces and anti-government demonstrators . The victim was O'laa Jablawi , a 2 1/2 - year-old girl from the besieged port city of Latakia , shot in the eye and killed when she and her parents attempted to flee the besieged city on Sunday in a car that came under fire , activists said . They were among those who fled as security forces cracked down on al-Ramel , a Latakia neighborhood that has been the center of anti-government demonstrations . Syrian security forces told residents to get out during the military offensive , which occurred by sea as well as land . According to human rights activists and anti-government protesters , that 's exactly what the girls ' parents tried to do -- flee . Activists said she was shot by security forces . The Syrian government has yet to comment . The activists believe her father was shot in the shoulder and possibly detained . The mother 's fate is unknown . On one video , a voice shrieks , `` She 's just a child . He killed her , the evil Bashar al-Assad , '' a reference to the nation 's president . On another , a voice says , `` Look , these are Bashar al-Assad 's reforms . '' CNN can not independently confirm the authenticity of the videos and the reports about them , so it is very difficult to find out how the child died . The United Nations , global leaders , and human rights organizations all have urged the Syrian government to allow humanitarian workers , U.N. representatives and the media access to the country . Those pleas have had no effect . But the videos are the latest in a series of grisly and disturbing images to emerge from the country . Protesters consistently say the government is responsible for the conflict and bloodshed . Syria has consistently blamed the violence in the country on armed gangs . Nevertheless , O'laa was an innocent , caught in the crossfire of an intensifying battle between those calling for freedom and a regime intent on staying in power . Back in May , the U.N. Children 's Fund , or UNICEF called on the government to spare civilians , particularly women and children , amid reports of youthful casualties . `` While UNICEF can not verify the reported cases and events , we are particularly disturbed by the recent video images of children who were arbitrarily detained and suffered torture or ill-treatment during their detention , leading in some cases to their death , '' the agency said . Asked for an update , a UNICEF spokesman said there is `` nothing really to add '' from the May statement . Arwa Damon reported from Beirut , Lebanon ; Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal prosecutors said Friday that they will seek the death penalty for a 22-year-old man accused in the shooting death last year of Eve Carson , student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . Police said UNC student body President Eve Carson was taken from her home and killed . A grand jury indicted Demario James Atwater on October 27 on federal charges of carjacking resulting in death , carrying and using firearms in relation to carjacking , being a felon in possession of a firearm , and possessing a short-barreled shotgun not properly registered to him . He also faces state first-degree murder charges in Orange County , North Carolina , along with 18-year-old Lawrence Alvin Lovette . `` Both federal and state law violations are implicated in the tragic events of March 5 , 2008 , and we will vigorously prosecute the violations of federal law committed in connection with the death of Eve Marie Carson , '' said Anna Mills Wagoner , U.S. attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina , at the time of Atwater 's indictment . An autopsy report showed that Carson , an honors student , had multiple gunshot wounds when she was found lying on a Chapel Hill street . The autopsy report listed six gunshot wounds but said two of the wounds were probably from the same bullet . Court documents released in the North Carolina case said Carson was taken from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with ATM access to her bank account before she was shot to death in the early hours of March 5 . Applications filed for search warrants said a confidential informant told police that Atwater said he and Lovette entered Carson 's home through an open door and forced her to accompany them in her car . The informant said she had talked with Atwater after a picture was shown on television of someone attempting to use Carson 's ATM card at a convenience store two days after her body was found . The informant said the two men drove Carson to an ATM , obtained her PIN from her and then shot her . The witness told police that Atwater said the two got about $ 1,400 from Carson 's account . Bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period , the documents said . Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall has said he also will seek the death penalty against Atwater , according to the Raleigh News and Observer . Authorities can not seek the death penalty against Lovette because he was 17 at the time of the slaying , the newspaper said . Carson 's death shocked the community and drew national attention . An estimated 10,000 people turned out for a service in her honor . The Athens , Georgia , native was a pre-medicine student double-majoring in political science and biology . She was a recipient of the university 's prestigious Morehead Scholarship and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society , according to UNC .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Parma have signed AC Milan 's 18-year-old Alberto Paloschi in a co-ownership deal , the Serie B club announced on their Web site on Wednesday . Paloschi scored with his first touch when he made his debut as a Milan sub in February . Paloschi made an instant impact when he made his debut for Milan in February , scoring against Siena with his first touch as substitute . He scored twice in seven appearances last season but his prospects of regular first team football this season diminished sharply after the signings of Andrei Shevchenko and Ronaldinho . Parma were relegated from Serie A last season . . Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani has said that that Italy full-back Massimo Oddo could be leaving soon . Galliano told Gazzetta dello Sport : `` Lyon are interested in our full-back and anything is possible . '' The 32-year-old former Lazio right-back is likely to lose his first team spot to new signing Gianluca Zambrotta from Barcelona . Oddo was in Italy 's World Cup winning squad in Germany in 2006 but was not chosen for the Euro 2008 finals in June . Lyon already have an Italian at left-back in Fabio Grosso , who was also a World Cup winner in 2006 .

The growing sophistication of malware attacks mirrors the growing threat -- and cash -- generated by online crime . Already , cyber crime is estimated to cost companies and consumers more than $ 100 billion worldwide . Some officials claim it has now eclipsed illegal drugs as a criminal moneymaker . `` It 's very seldom reported ... if discovered by companies , they generally do n't want the public to know they 've been had , '' said Eugene Spafford , a computer security specialist at Purdue University who has advised two U.S. presidents and numerous companies and government agencies . Cyber crime is one of the few industries benefiting from the financial crisis . Last year , antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined . In the United States , the FBI reported a 33 percent increase in Internet crime last year . Companies lost an average of $ 4.6 million in intellectual property last year , according to a survey of 1000 firms worldwide by Purdue University and McAfee . `` As the economy has declined , we 've seen the threat landscape increase , '' David DeWalt , president and CEO of McAfee , recently told Richard Quest for CNN International 's `` Quest Means Business . '' That increase has helped antivirus makers such as McAfee snare record returns -- the company 's first quarter profits were 21 percent higher than same period last year . But companies and governments find themselves in a losing war with Web-savvy criminals , experts say . `` The fundamental fact is cyber criminals are highly organized with sophisticated corporate structures and business chains , '' said Michael Fraser , director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia . `` They have R&D departments , strong distribution networks and Web sites for the discerning cyber criminal , '' Fraser said . On these Web sites , would-be criminals can purchase toolkits to learn how to side step security measures or create their own `` botnet '' -- referring to software that can , unbeknownst to victims , turn their computers into spamming foot-soldiers for criminal networks . One Web site advertises software that can capture information for a popular Internet secured-payment provider for $ 500 -- discounted to $ 400 for the first 100 buyers . Skimmed credit card numbers and other personal-identity information stolen from computers also can be found for sale on Web sites , Fraser said . `` When police shut these Web sites down , they just mushroom up some other place , '' he said . Although the techniques of cyber crime have evolved , online criminals prey on human vulnerabilities like criminals throughout the ages . In the digital age , that means tempting with free downloads , money schemes and pornography . The range of tools used by cyber criminals reveals the quick evolution of the industry . Viruses -- the first generation of the computer culprits -- are used for the computer equivalent of vandalism , as the malicious programs replicate , spread and damage computers . `` When the company was set up , we were seeing two or three new viruses a week , '' said Mahendra Negi , chief financial officer of Tokyo-based antivirus maker Trend Micro . `` Now there 's a new one every two-and-a-half seconds . `` With the arrival of spam in 2001 and 2002 , the big difference was it was commercial malware , '' Negi said . `` Once money became involved , the level of sophistication raised a hundred-fold . '' Now the biggest threats include `` phishing '' schemes and `` botnet '' attacks . Phishing is where criminals masquerade as a legitimate business or Web site and trick victims into revealing passwords , credit card information and other personal data . Botnet attackers commandeer personal computers as part of a large network of `` zombie '' computers that , on command , target companies for spam attacks to cripple IT capabilities . Botnets -- some of which are large enough to deploy tens of billions of spam e-mails a day -- are often used in extortion schemes . `` They ring up the IT manager of a company and say , ` Pay us a million or we 'll take you down ' , '' said Fraser , who has worked with companies victimized by botnet attacks . Companies often pay up and shut up , computer experts say , rather than report the crime and garner publicity that may hurt their corporate reputation . And unlike prankster virus-makers , these malware makers are determined to stay hidden . `` Once it became a business , then -LRB- cyber criminals -RRB- began to look at what companies like us were doing , and figure out weaknesses , '' he said . `` They are very customer friendly ... they sell updates , they will highlight what the product does and what antivirus software ca n't detect them . Adding to the difficulty is the legal situation that in many jurisdictions , it is not illegal to create or sell malware . `` It 's like the arms industry ... it 's not a crime to build and sell them , '' Negi said . And because of the transnational nature of the crime , it 's extremely difficult to prosecute . A scan of 500 headlines on Internet-related arrests from newspapers around the world the past two years found about 90 percent were related to child-pornography cases . `` Child pornography is easier to prosecute because it is possible to find the evidence on the perpetrator 's computer systems , '' said Spafford of Purdue University . Cyber-criminal networks are as porous as the Internet itself . `` There are multiple jurisdictions and unless it 's an ongoing crime that uses the same path all the time , the trail goes cold quickly , '' Spafford said . `` I may be able to trace back to a computer system , if I 'm lucky , or trace it back to a cyber cafe -- but how do I know who was behind it ? '' Often criminal networks are run in countries such as Russia and China , where government officials turn a blind eye to these activities -- so long as their victims reside outside the host country , Spafford said . `` For the host countries , that 's dangerous ... it 's kind of like breeding tigers in the back yard and saying , ` Well , they have n't hurt anyone here yet , ' '' he said . `` Mexico is a wonderful example ... they tolerated drug smugglers for years , and now it 's such a major problem and incredibly painful and costly to run them out . `` I 'm not saying -LRB- cyber criminals -RRB- are involved in physical violence , but it 's not out of the realm of possibility , '' he said . `` What are they doing with all that money ? ''
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The future of Detroit is electric cars , the governor of Michigan declared in an opinion piece on Newsweek 's Web site . The Chevy Volt is one of the electric cars being developed by Michigan 's auto industry . `` In Michigan , we are doing everything we can to become the home of this new electric auto industry -- and to the jobs this industry will create , '' wrote Gov. Jennifer Granholm . `` Again , the road to a stronger future for our country will begin in Michigan . '' She said that for automakers , replacing the 100-year-old internal-combustion engine is both `` revolutionary and daunting . '' Ann Marie Sastry , director of the energy systems engineering program at the University of Michigan , said the industry will have to take risks and government support will be essential . `` Gov. Granholm is doing exactly what we all hope our elected officials will do -- she is supporting partnerships and growth in critical economic areas , '' Sastry said . `` She 's enunciated a vision for clean vehicles that builds our regional economy and provides global , sustainable transportation solutions . `` We understand that these investments will take time to reach profitability , but these are hard problems , and they are worth investment and risk . The risk of doing nothing is much , much greater . I 'm glad she is making the case for Michigan . '' Granholm said all of Detroit 's Big Three automakers -- General Motors , Ford and Chrysler -- are working on electric vehicles . `` General Motors plans to make lithium-ion battery packs to power the Chevy Volt , which is expected to earn a fuel-economy rating of more than 100 mpg , '' she wrote . '' ... As Ford celebrates the sale of the 100,000 th hybrid Escape , it is preparing for the introduction of a full line of new hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles . Chrysler , too , is electrifying its product lines . '' Sastry said she could n't be more delighted with GM 's plans for the Volt as a `` truly mass-marketed electrified drive train using electric technology . '' In 2008 , GM sold 14,439 hybrid vehicles , according to a statement from the company . `` These companies are serious about transforming themselves and transforming us into a nation less reliant on foreign oil , '' Granholm wrote . Sastry said public opinion toward energy conservation is a major factor in the companies being willing to take the risk of creating the new types of cars . `` These very large companies are placing a bet on the future in no small measure because of the American public 's change in attitude toward it , '' she said . In her commentary , Granholm referred to President Barack Obama 's plan , announced in February , to direct $ 2 billion from the economic stimulus package into technology aimed at putting 1 million American-made , plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road by 2015 . Sastry said it 's hard to predict when something of that scale will happen -- many industry experts disagree on an exact time -- but it will happen . `` Keep in mind , several industries have to work together to make this happen , '' she said .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Saudi Arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gang-raped -- and then sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case . Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim . The attorney , Abdulrahman al-Lahim , had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the Saudi-controlled media about the case , al-Lahim told CNN . The judge more than doubled the sentence against al-Lahim 's 19-year-old client because she spoke to the media about the case , a court source told Arab News , an English-language Middle Eastern daily newspaper . The woman -- who was initially sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes -- had her sentenced increased to 200 lashes and was ordered to serve six months in prison under Saudi Arabia 's strict Islamic law . `` We were shocked , '' al-Lahim said of the increased sentence . CNN has been unable to reach Saudi government officials for comment on this report , despite repeated requests . Watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim '' Al-Lahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty , but instead the court agreed to increase their jail sentences , which had been two to three years , to two to nine years , al-Lahim said . The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups . `` Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself , '' said Fawzeyah al-Oyouni , founding member of the newly formed Saudi Association for the Defense of Women 's Rights . `` This is not just about the girl , it 's about every woman in Saudi Arabia , '' she said . `` We 're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every Saudi woman out there . We 're afraid of going out in the streets . '' Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah `` to immediely void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer . '' The woman , who is married , and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago , the lawyer said . The male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison , al-Lahim said . The man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him , according to al-Lahim . Citing phone records from the police investigation , al-Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client . He noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position . Al-Lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day . It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi 's Islamic law . Al-Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month , where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment , according to Human Rights Watch . He told CNN he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al-Sheikh . `` Currently she does n't have a lawyer , and I feel they 're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights , '' he said . `` We will not accept this judgment and I 'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place . '' He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month . `` The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions , '' he said . Saudi Arabia 's Islamic law or sharia is not written and , therefore , subject to a wide array of interpretations . Human Rights Watch points out that a judge in Jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the Ismaili faith , a branch of Shia Islam . Under Saudi law , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery . Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man , and they are not allowed to vote . The Saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom , including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases , adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women 's rights and creation of a human rights commission . Christoph Wilcke of Human Rights Watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case , which he said may be indicative of `` many injustices that we still do n't know about . '' `` It 's not only one court , it is the Saudi government that is fully behind punishing a woman who 's been raped -LSB- and -RSB- punishing the lawyer who 's trying to help her and doing that both because they 've spoken to the media , '' Wilcke told CNN . `` And if they had n't spoken to the media , we would n't know about it . '' Shying away from criticism of key ally , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the case and the punishment `` surprising '' and `` astonishing . '' `` While this is a judicial procedure -- part of a judicial procedure -- overseas in courts outside of our country , still while it is very difficult to offer any detailed comment about this situation , I think most people would be quite astonished by the situation , '' McCormack said . `` I ca n't get involved in specific court cases in Saudi Arabia dealing with its own citizens . But most people here would be quite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out , '' he said .

LONGBOAT KEY , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Like any sun-drenched beach paradise , Longboat Key offers water sports , biking and tennis , but the best way to enjoy the island may be by doing nothing at all . Low season on Longboat Key , Florida , generally starts in May and runs until late fall . This thin sliver of land off Sarasota on Florida 's west coast is home to 8,000 people year-round , but come winter , the population swells dramatically . Thousands of visitors from colder climates flock to LBK -- its shorthand moniker -- from January to April to enjoy its balmy temperatures and the sparkling turquoise waters of the Gulf of Mexico . Off season , however , the only crowds are the sea gulls grooming their feathers on the warm white sand , and Longboat Key feels like the closest thing to having a private beach . On a recent late-September visit , the temperatures hovered in the mid-80s , palm trees swayed gently in the wind , hibiscus flowers bloomed and the sun 's rays were on par with their intensity in July . The only signs of fall were the pumpkins on display at the local grocery store , along with regular fare , like mango Key lime pie . See photos of Longboat Key 's beaches , birds and sunsets '' Tell people you are heading to Longboat Key , and many will think it 's part of the Florida Keys off the southern tip of the state , but LBK is about 200 miles to the north-northwest of -- and in some ways worlds away from -- Key West and its neighbors . Nightlife on the island is likely to mean a moonlit walk on the beach rather than a drink at the bar , and the odds are good the locals will sport gray hair . Elegant setting Buffered by Sarasota Bay on one side and facing the Gulf of Mexico on the other , the Key is sheltered from the tourist hustle and bustle of mainland Florida . At less than 11 miles in length and no more than a mile across in its widest places , LBK also feels like a secluded community with an elegant flavor of its own . The surroundings are lush , upscale and serene . A trip down Gulf of Mexico Drive , the island 's main artery , reveals golf courses , condominiums and homes ranging from newly constructed mansions to older , one-story houses . The traffic is light , life moves at a slower pace and the mood is relaxed . `` You wo n't find mini-malls , towering billboards , or glaring neon signs , '' the local Chamber of Commerce promises . Nonhuman island visitors also contribute to the mellow atmosphere . Dolphins regularly swim just offshore . Great egrets and great blue herons fish along the beach , while pelicans dive into the water in search of a meal . Birds of all sizes regularly patrol the palm-lined parking lot of the local supermarket looking for scraps of food from the lunch crowd . Wingless creatures also pop up in unexpected places . Visitors walking into one establishment are greeted by a stern voice exclaiming , `` Bear , no ! '' Bear , it turns out , is a curious 5-month old Chesapeake Bay retriever who insists on checking out all the customers entering the store despite his owner 's orders to stay put . Lodging and shopping There are few hotels on Longboat Key , but rental homes and condos abound , so it 's best to make lodging arrangements in advance , especially for visitors who plan to stay a while . Low season generally starts in May and runs until November . Tourists yearning to make the island a permanent home should bring along a big wallet . The average sale price for a condominium was more than $ 1 million last year , and it topped $ 1.5 million for a single-family home , according to the local Chamber of Commerce . Spenders on a smaller scale can get their fix in neighboring St. Armands Key and its unique shopping circle lined with boutiques and restaurants . -LRB- The official motto urges visitors to `` get out of the box , get into the circle . '' -RRB- Shoppers can find anything from jewelry to knock-out shoes to sea shells of all shapes and sizes . Depending on your budget and appetite , a lunch break can range from a latte to a smoked salmon and brie grilled cheese . St. Armands Circle is a great place to people watch , but it 's good to know the tranquil beach back on Longboat Key is just a short drive away . Shopping can be exhausting when sunny , lazy days in a blissful place are filled with doing nothing at all .
LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A fan of English football club Arsenal has been injured after the bus he and other supporters were traveling in was ambushed before the sides ' Champions League clash in Rome , Wednesday night . Winners : Arsenal beat Roma 7-6 on penalties after one of their fans was injured before the game . A spokesman from the British Embassy in Rome told CNN the fan was understood to have suffered wounds to the leg -- but it was unsure if he had been stabbed or injured by broken glass . The spokesman said the mini bus , which was not an official tour bus , became lost near the stadium and `` ended up at the wrong part of the ground '' . Roma fans nearby set about attacking the bus , the spokesman said . `` They smashed the windows and then one of them managed to get on the bus . This appears to be where the injury occurred , '' he said . Police were quick to arrive and the bus managed to move on to safety , where the fan was treated for the wound , he said . The visiting side went on to win the tie 7-6 on penalties after Roma won the game 1-0 , leaving the two-match tie level 1-1 on aggregate . Arsenal had distributed a booklet to its estimated 3,500 traveling fans warning that they were `` at risk '' if they traveled alone to the Stadio Olimpico . The booklet warned supporters to stay clear of areas that were known gathering points of Roma 's `` Ultra '' fans -- a group known for creating conflict with rival supporters . Last month ten football fans were shot dead in the south of Nigeria on the way to support their team . The victims were traveling supporters of the Ocean Boys Football Club in Nigeria . Also in February , one fan was killed and at least 40 more injured when violence broke out at football matches across Brazil . In 2007 , Manchester United fans were injured after violence in two separate incidents with Roma fans when the teams met in Rome . In 2003 five England fans suffered gunshot wounds during a violent incident in Zurich , Switzerland , before the side played a Euro 2004 qualifier with Liechtenstein .
Moscow , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Artyem Saveliev turns eight years old this week . His birthday will be anything but normal . Last Thursday his American adoptive family put him on a solo , trans-Atlantic flight from the United States to Moscow . They hired a Russian driver to deliver the boy from the airport to the Russian Ministry of Education . Russian officials allowed CNN to see a copy of a letter addressed to the Ministry of Education and signed by Artyem 's adoptive mother , Torry Hansen , which the little boy carried when he arrived . `` To Whom It May Concern , '' the letter reads , `` This child is mentally unstable . He is violent and has severe psychopathic issues/behaviors . I was lied to and misled by the Russian Orphanage workers and director regarding his mental stability ... After giving my best to this child , I am sorry to say that for the safety of my family , friends and myself , I no longer wish to parent this child . As he is a Russian National , I am returning him to your guardianship and would like the adoption disannulled -LSB- sic -RSB- . '' Russian officials are fuming at these accusations . `` How can you imagine that a 7-year-old boy can be -LSB- a -RSB- menace or danger for the family ? For the adult people ? '' said Pavel Astakhov , Russia 's Child Rights Ombudsmen . '' -LSB- Artyem -RSB- is in very good mental and physical condition , '' Astakhov said . `` He 's a very nice boy . He 's funny . And he 's very communicative . '' Astakhov met with Artyem several times since he arrived in Moscow , as have officials from the U.S. Embassy . `` When we saw him , he looked like a very tired little boy off a long trans-Atlantic flight , '' said John Beyrle , the U.S. ambassador in Moscow . The case of Artyem comes after the Russian media focused intense attention on several previous cases in recent years of abuse involving adopted Russian children in the United States . Not surprisingly , some Russians are calling for an end to the practice of foreign adoption . `` I am against the idea of sending our children abroad , '' said a woman , who gave her name only as Alexandra , as she watched her grandchildren play on a sunny day in a Moscow park . Russian officials have made public appeals for a temporary freeze of American adoption of Russian children until a proposed bilateral treaty has been signed to allow monitoring of children after they are brought to the United States . `` We do n't have any instrument or tools to control our children which are living in adoptive families , '' said Astakhov . `` In this situation we have a kind of legal vacuum ... we have to freeze all activity in the adoptive process for the United States of America . '' Those are ominous words for thousands of desperate American families who end up waiting years and spending tens of thousands of dollars trying to adopt Russian children . According to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow , more then 50,000 Russian children have been adopted by American families in the last 16 years . The U.S. State Department offered to send a delegation of diplomats to Moscow later this month to address the adoption issue . `` The Russian government has now told us informally that that 's acceptable . We 're actually working out the dates , '' said Beyrle . `` So I would say to American families that are in the process of adoption not to worry too much . We 're working on this , and we really do n't think that this will have any long-term effect on the ability of American families to adopt here . '' Russia has no shortage of orphans . The United Nations Children Fund reported that in 2008 , some 714,000 Russian children were living in state institutions . Unlike many Western societies , the vast majority -- 83 percent of these children -- are `` social orphans '' taken from biological parents who were deemed unfit by Russian state agencies , said Bertram Beinvel , UNICEF 's representative in Moscow . `` What is important to draw out of this -LSB- Artyem 's -RSB- case is to conduct a thorough analysis on the adoption of the child , then to -LSB- learn -RSB- what happened when he was put back on the plane , '' Beinvel said . He also called for a bilateral treaty to prevent future cases of abuse from occurring . Both U.S. and Russian officials predicted it might take a matter of months to hammer out this proposed agreement . But that offers little consolation to Artyem Saveliev , who has now lost two families before reaching the age of 8 . `` He lost his native family , his mother . And he lost his adoptive family , Torry Hansen , '' said Astakhov . `` Now the best way is to place him in a new family which can give him attention and love . '' But Astakhov made it clear any new family for Artyem would be a Russian one .
After years of speculation and rare case reports , a study suggests that stimulant medication -- mostly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- may have played a role in a handful of cases of sudden , unexplained death in children and adolescents . Untreated ADHD can lead to poor school performance and increase adolescents ' risk for harmful behavior . The study authors stress , however , that parents and doctors should not refrain from treating children with ADHD just because of these results . `` The association is significant in that it 's real , but that does n't mean it 's not a very low risk , '' says lead author Madelyn S. Gould , Ph.D. , a professor of psychiatry and public health at Columbia University , in New York . `` There probably does need to be more careful monitoring , but the bottom line is that parents should not take their children off stimulant medication they 're currently on and should not be scared to have their child go on a stimulant if that 's what they and their doctors decide is the best thing for their child . '' The study , published this week in the American Journal of Psychiatry , is the first to suggest that the stimulants may pose a risk -- albeit remote -- in children without underlying heart problems . About 2.5 million children in the United States take such medications . Stimulants linked to 1.8 percent of unexplained deaths Gould and her colleagues compared medical records and parent interviews of children and adolescents who had died between the years of 1985 and 1996 , including 564 who had died from an unexplained heart-rate abnormality or other causes , and 564 who died as passengers in motor vehicle accidents . They excluded cases with other known possible causes of death , such as asthma or congenital heart diseases . Of all the unexplained cases , the researchers found that 10 children , or 1.8 percent of the group , had had stimulant medication prescribed . This compared with only two cases of stimulant use , or 0.4 percent , among healthy children who had died in motor vehicle accidents -- a group used to represent a general population of healthy children and adolescents . Health.com : Treatment options for ADHD at any age In all 10 cases , the children were taking methylphenidate , the active ingredient in Ritalin and Concerta . A similar drug , Adderall , is composed of mixed amphetamine salts and was not included in the study results because it was first approved in 1996 . However , the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 asked the manufacturers of stimulants , including Adderall , to add a warning to their label saying the medications should not be used in children with structural heart abnormalities or other heart problems . At the time , the FDA advisory panel rejected a more stringent black-box warning about the possible risk of sudden unexplained death . Strattera , another medication approved for ADHD in children , is not a stimulant medication . A spokesperson for McNeil Pediatrics , which distributes and markets Concerta , says the company welcomes any data that add to the body of knowledge in this therapeutic area , but did not make a specific comment on the new study . Michael Billings , a spokesperson for Novartis , the manufacturer of Ritalin , notes that the drug has been used for more than 50 years and is the most studied ADHD medication . Health.com : Secrets to a stress-free home `` For all of its products , Novartis reviews its global safety and efficacy through post-marketing surveillance and consistently reports new information to health authorities on an ongoing basis , '' says Billings . `` Review of Novartis safety data has failed to detect an increased risk in sudden cardiac death associated with methylphenidate use . '' Not a watershed moment , researchers say Gould says it 's important to report this association , but she is also concerned about the results being misinterpreted . `` We 're very sensitive to not wanting this to be some watershed moment where stimulant medications start to get used less and get used inappropriately , '' she explains . In an editorial accompanying the article , Benedetto Vitiello , M.D. , and Kenneth Towbin , M.D. , of the National Institute of Mental Health , agree with Gould 's concerns . Health.com : The Top 5 cholesterol myths They write that the study findings `` should underscore that stimulant medications are not innocuous and that their therapeutic use requires careful diagnostic assessment , diligent safety screening , and ongoing monitoring . `` However , it is equally clear that sudden , unexplained death is a rare event , this is only the first such study , it relies on small numbers , and it is not possible to quantify the risk beyond estimating that it is very small . '' Indeed , since a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial is n't ethically possible in this situation , it is hard to conduct a study that 's not without flaws . Although the researchers are confident that the results are not due to any underlying factors -- children with ADHD often have asthma and heart conditions also linked with sudden death , and so these cases were eliminated from the analysis -- `` one can never be 100 percent sure that there are n't other unknown or undiagnosed issues , '' says Gould . Health.com : Slideshow : Celebrities with ADHD James Perrin , M.D. , a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital for Children , says the study is n't surprising `` nor particularly convincing . '' He says the research is flawed because , among other problems , it may have underestimated the number of children who were taking stimulants . The rate of stimulant use , particularly in the accident-related deaths , was lower than expected , he says . `` The study adds very little to what we already know , i.e. , that some children who receive stimulants experience sudden unexpected death , '' says Dr. Perrin , who was not involved in the study . `` The current study should not change the use of any medications or treatments . '' More research , careful monitoring is needed Stimulant medications currently contain a warning targeted to specific high-risk children , including those with structural heart defects , cardiomyopathy , or heart-rhythm disturbances . The medication labels also warn that stimulants may raise blood pressure and heart rate , and have been linked with stroke and heart attack in adults . When deciding whether to put a child on stimulant medications , both clinicians and parents should weigh the seriousness of the situation , says Gould . The benefits may not outweigh the risk in cases in which attention problems may be keeping a B-student from becoming an A-student , she explains . Health.com : Yoga moves to beat ease stress , insomnia , and pain But with more serious cases , the choice should be clearer . Untreated ADHD can be harmful in itself , leading to poor performance in school and increasing adolescents ' risk for harmful behavior such as reckless driving , unsafe sexual practices , and substance abuse . `` I have two boys , now grown , so I can certainly relate to parents facing these decisions , '' Gould says . `` If my child was having problems to the extent that a neurologist or psychiatrist was recommending medication , I would want the medication -- although , even though we did n't discuss this specifically in the study , I would want my child to have an EKG . '' In 2008 , the American Heart Association recommended that doctors consider routine electrocardiograms before starting children with ADHD on stimulants or other psychotropic medications , but underscored the need for future research . An EKG may help to detect cardiac abnormalities that would increase a child 's vulnerability to sudden heart problems . Parents considering stimulant medication for their children should also provide their doctor with a detailed family history , including any heart problems or sudden deaths of close family members . Future research should focus on new ways to detect which children are most at risk for sudden death when taking stimulants , says Gould , since not all cases seem to be detectable with routine screenings . Until then , a thorough examination and careful monitoring is the best way to reduce a child 's danger . The study was funded by a grant from the NIMH and a contract with the FDA .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There will be no criminal charges filed in the death of a Green Beret who was electrocuted in his quarters in Iraq last year , the Department of Defense said Friday . Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , a 24-year-old Green Beret , died in a shower at his base in Iraq in January 2008 . The Army 's 11-month investigation `` concluded that there is insufficient evidence to prove or disprove that any one person , persons or entity was criminally culpable '' in the death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , the Department of Defense said in a written statement . Maseth , a 24-year-old decorated Green Beret from Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , was electrocuted in a shower in his Baghdad quarters -- a former palace of deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- in January 2008 . `` The investigation revealed that there were numerous entities , individuals , both contractors and government employees , who breached their respective duties of care ; however , none of those breaches , in and of themselves , were the proximate cause of his death , '' the Army said . A report released last month from the Pentagon 's inspector general found that Maseth 's death stemmed from failures both by the U.S. military and by military contractor KBR . The company did not properly ground and inspect electrical equipment , the inspector general 's report found , while Maseth 's commanders failed to ensure that renovations to the building where he was based had been properly done . The Army did not set electrical standards for jobs or contractors . KBR has said the palace was not properly grounded by contractors when it was built . The Pentagon report concluded that KBR failed to ground a water pump at the building , and the company did not report improperly grounded equipment during routine maintenance . Maseth 's family is suing the company . After the Pentagon inspector general 's report Sens. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania , both Democrats , called on the Pentagon last month to take back more than $ 83 million in bonuses paid to KBR . Casey said the Pentagon should fine KBR : `` Make it hurt and make it count . '' The Department of Defense said there were 18 reported deaths caused by electrocution in Iraq since the war began and that a task force designed to assess fire and electrical safety issues in Iraq was created `` after a series of electrical accidents and incidents . '' The task force has inspected more than 67,000 of the approximately 90,000 pieces of equipment and facilities in Iraq . Almost 14,000 deficiencies have been corrected , the department said .
NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A pedestrian was struck twice by vehicles in Queens and dragged for 17 miles by the second vehicle before police found him dead in Brooklyn , New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters Wednesday . Surveillance video shows a body in the middle of the street . The badly mangled body was discovered under a van after several passing motorists motioned the driver to pull over , Kelly said . Police had not identified the victim Wednesday evening , he said . The first driver called 911 to report he thought he had struck a pedestrian but did not see anyone . It turned out the second driver , in a van , had driven over the man , whose body became lodged under its chassis , according to police . Kelly said the van driver stopped at one point during the drive on New York City 's highways and roads because he noticed the vehicle was not driving properly . But he failed to find anything unusual , Kelly said . Police are retracing the route the van drove in an attempt to find body parts , he said . No charges have been filed , Kelly told reporters Wednesday afternoon .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was still dark when Stan Brock began calling out numbers on his megaphone to admit a crowd of hundreds gathered at a Los Angeles sports arena Tuesday morning . A mobile health clinic offering free services has drawn thousands of people in Los Angeles in the last week . `` We opened the door at 5:30 and there were 600-odd people already gathered , '' he told CNN . Over the last week , thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical , a non-profit organization founded by Brock . Tuesday marks the final day of its eight-day operation in Los Angeles , which so far has resulted in the provision of at least $ 2 million in free health care services , according to Brock 's early estimates . Remote Area Medical , better known as RAM , is a volunteer organization that brings free medical , dental and vision care to people around the world . See other groups that provide much-needed health services '' Since its launch in 1985 , RAM has sent expeditions to developing corners of the world , including Haiti , the Dominican Republic and India . But in recent years , the Knoxville , Tenn.-based organization has faced increasing demand for its services in the U.S. , including from large urban areas . `` We 've had to cut back on services to needy places like Haiti because of overwhelming need in the U.S. , '' Brock told CNN . `` We have to take care of the home front first . '' On the final day of the Los Angeles operation , Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care . Patients have spent hours waiting in line in the past week for the chance to get free care . RAM has had to turn away some patients because it did n't have enough volunteers to provide treatment . It has n't reached its target of treating 1,500 patients a day , but Brock still considers the operation a success . He said RAM has treated at least 4,557 people , and that does n't include figures from the last two days of the operation , which are n't available yet , he said . Many patients have used more than one service , resulting in roughly 11,500 patient encounters . That includes the extraction of nearly 1,800 bad teeth and the production of 1,090 pairs of new eyeglasses . While limited access to health care is often associated with developing countries , it 's a problem that faces patients around the world . That 's become increasingly clear as America debates the future of health care . Los Angeles is by far the largest urban community RAM has served so far . The organization has been besieged for requests from a number of metro areas , including Detroit , Seattle , Miami and Atlanta , Brock said . The lack of accessible health care from an economic standpoint is a problem that has been going on for decades , Brock said . `` We could have come to Los Angeles 15 years ago and I guarantee there would have been just as big of a turnout of patients , '' he told CNN . Brock started RAM after spending 15 years in what used to be British Guiana -- now known as Guyana -- in South America . In that isolated area , it would take 26 days on foot to reach care , Brock recalled , and he wanted to find a way to bring medical care to such remote areas . RAM usually provides services in the Appalachia region of the U.S. where it 's easier for volunteers to work , Brock said . Medical practitioners providing free care in Tennessee can be licensed in any state . Unfortunately , he said , other states do n't have similar provisions , making it difficult for RAM to recruit enough local volunteers to be able to deal with the demand if they were to set up in areas like New York or Washington . Running the temporary clinic is practically a 24-hour operation . Brock 's day starts at 4 a.m. and runs well into the night . But it 's a rewarding experience for volunteers when they get to see how much their efforts have been appreciated , he said . `` When you see a patient who has had thousands of dollars of free dental care come out of a dental chair and they 've got tears in their eyes and hug the dentist and dental assistant , it makes it all worthwhile .

BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Members of an Iranian group say Iraqi forces have beaten and abused them as Iraqis move to expel the Iranians from a camp on Iraqi land . About 3,500 people live at Camp Ashraf , where members of the People 's Mujahedin have lived for 24 years . The Iranian group -- designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Iran -- has asked the United States to intervene on their behalf . About 3,500 people live at Camp Ashraf , most of them members of the People 's Mujahedin Organization of Iran who have lived at the camp for 24 years after fleeing Iran . Iran , Iraq , Canada and the United States consider the People 's Mujahedin , which opposes the government in Tehran , a terrorist organization , although the European Union removed the group from its terrorist list in January . The United Kingdom did so last year . The People 's Mujahedin accused the Iraqi military of entering the camp north of Baghdad on Friday and forcibly evacuating a building that served mostly as a women 's dormitory . Ashraf residents rallied Monday against the military , chanting for Imam Hussein -- the Prophet Mohammed 's grandson and a holy figure for Shiite Muslims -- to save them from the abuse of the Iraqi soldiers . Statements from the National Council of Resistance to Iran , an umbrella group of Iranian opposition organizations -- the largest of which is the People 's Mujahedin -- accuse Iraq 's Shiite-dominated government of doing the bidding of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , also a Shiite . `` The Iranian Resistance calls for urgent intervention of the U.S. government and competent international bodies to neutralize plots by the clerical regime and prevent a human catastrophe in Camp Ashraf , '' said a statement dated Sunday . Iraq 's government denied that it was acting on Khamenei 's behalf . `` The Iraqi government 's position is clear and there is no retreat from its decision to close Camp Ashraf , '' said a statement from the office of National Security Adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie . `` The national security adviser is only implementing the decision and the policy of the Iraqi government . '' The National Council also accused the Iraqis of barring delivery of all supplies to the camp except for food , banning Iraqi workers from entering the camp and blocking families from visiting relatives inside the camp . The Iraqi government statement denied keeping supplies from Camp Ashraf . `` The Iraqi government continues to facilitate all humanitarian materials entering Camp Ashraf , '' the Iraqi statement said . '' ... We welcome any visit by any international organization . '' A People 's Mujahedin spokesman in Camp Ashraf called the statement false and asked international groups `` to visit Ashraf and observe the facts and realities of the present situation by themselves . '' Camp Ashraf , which has housed Iranians since the mid-1980s , was under U.S. protection until January 1 , when it was handed over to the Iraqis . Maryam Rajavi , president-elect of the National Council and the long-time leader of People 's Mujahedin , sent a letter to President Obama asking for help against `` a conspiracy hatched by the religious dictatorship ruling Iran against the lives of 3,500 residents of Camp Ashraf . '' Rajavi cited comments by Khamenei during a meeting with Iraqi President Jalal Talibani last month calling for the expulsion of the People 's Mujahedin from Iraq and later comments by former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during a trip to Baghdad calling for Camp Ashraf 's closure . After those remarks , the National Council said , al-Rubaie declared that the Iranians at Camp Ashraf had no right to refugee status or to political asylum and would be expelled either back to Iran or to a third country . Rajavi , in her letter to Obama , asked the president to `` issue an order so that the arrangements for the protection of Ashraf are reinstated to that which was in place before January 2009 , i.e. , the U.S. forces be tasked with the protection of Ashraf . '' The U.S. military in Iraq had no comment on the matter , referring queries to the State Department , which did not have an immediate comment . Also known as Mujahedin-e-Khalq , People 's Mujahedin was initially formed to oppose the shah of Iran , but fell out of favor with the Islamic revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after 1979 . People 's Mujahedin , which promotes a secular , Marxist government for Iran , waged a violent campaign against the fundamentalist Islamic Tehran government -- including bombings that killed politicians , judges and Cabinet members -- for years . The group allied with Saddam Hussein in Iraq in the mid-1980s and fought with the Iraqis against Iran in the latter years of the Iran-Iraq war . People 's Mujahedin renounced violence in 2001 , but a group of 12 former members told Human Rights Watch in 2005 that they were subject to physical and psychological abuse when they made it known they wanted to leave the organization . The group is also said to have provided Western governments with information about Iran 's nuclear program . The National Council accused al-Rubaie in particular of `` clearly implementing the dictates of Khamenei '' and said he should `` be prosecuted by international forces . ''
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood was released on bail Thursday after being arrested on suspicion of domestic assault . The 62-year-old was arrested near his home in southern England on Wednesday and spent the night in police custody before being released . `` I can confirm that there was an incident last night and that Ronnie Wood was arrested , '' a spokesman for the musician said , adding that he did not have any further details . As the case is under investigation , police have said little . They have not stated who filed the assault complaint . Wood will face police questioning again in January . The assault charge follows Wood 's highly publicized divorce last month from his wife of 24 years , Jo , on grounds of adultery . The divorce settlement set Wood back an estimated # 6.5 million -LRB- $ 10.7 million -RRB- . He and Jo have two children . Wood has reportedly been dating a 20-year-old Russian cocktail waitress , Ekaterina Ivanova , for a year .
LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Western politicians are currently scrambling for air tickets to Kiev . Britain 's Foreign Secretary David Miliband rushed to Ukraine soon after Russia announced its recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney will follow . Ukraine 's President Viktor Yuschenko has made it clear that he would welcome closer ties with the West . They want to shore up the Western-leaning President Viktor Yuschenko , amid fears that his country could become the next frontline in the power struggle between Russia and the West . It is in part a deliberate signal to an emboldened Moscow not to overreach . But EU nations will only be taking their support so far , for geographical , practical and political reasons . Conflict between Russia and Georgia , a tiny country of around 5 million citizens , was one thing . Conflict with the 47 million strong Ukraine would be a different matter , with much wider ramifications . What do you think of Russia 's relationship with the West ? While Georgia 's President Mikhail Saakashvili , at least for the moment , seems to have the bulk of the Georgian population behind him , Ukraine is much more divided about relations with Moscow . There is a huge energy dependency . Around 17 percent of Ukraine citizens , according to the census , are ethnic Russians . Even the country 's political leadership is divided . Although they were allies in Ukraine 's 2004 Orange Revolution and both would like to see Ukraine in the EU , Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has distanced herself from Yuschenko 's eagerness to enter the embrace of NATO . She has also criticized his presidential decree restricting the movements of Russia 's Ukraine-based Black Sea fleet , based in Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula , where there is a heavy concentration of ethnic Russians . Yuschenko flew to Tblisi to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Saakashvili over the conflict in Georgia , while Tymoshenko focused on calls for a cessation of hostilities . Miliband used his visit to Kiev to insist that Russia 's re-drawing of the map in the Caucusus was a moment of truth for Europe , marking the end of a post-Cold War period of geopolitical calm . But significantly Miliband also urged Ukraine to avoid giving Russia a pretext to intervene in the Crimea , where Kiev accuses Russia of trying to stir up trouble -- just as Saakashvili had accused Moscow of doing in South Ossetia before launching his military assault . The Ukranian port of Sebastopol is leased to the Russian Black Sea fleet until 2017 and Yuschenko has urged that Russia should be asked for a higher rent and be subject to more restrictions . Miliband may be making the toughest warning noises he dares to Russia , but he also urged that `` the Ukrainian government should ensure that the letter of the agreements are stuck to until 2017 . '' In recent years Ukraine has sought an uneasy balance between courting the West and not too overtly angering Moscow . But lately Yuschenko has grown bolder , offering to co-operate in the U.S. missile defense shield in Europe , despite the chilling threats from Moscow to Poland over its planned participation . NATO and EU leaders would not want him to get much bolder than that . While a majority of Ukrainians , according to opinion polls , would like to see their country in the EU , they are sharply divided about joining NATO . Only last April EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso complained about the country 's lack of political stability -LRB- a key qualification for membership -RRB- . Disputes between president and prime minister over relations with Russia , he suggested , were holding up progress . There is a regular EU/Ukraine meeting next month and Kiev will be looking for strong signals that it will meet a favorable response over its membership aims . Miliband declared in Kiev : `` My visit is designed to send a simple message : we have not forgotten our commitments to you . '' Ukraine allies like Poland will be pushing for those words to be reinforced with action , but EU commitments tend to come with rather vague timetables , and to become entangled in wider issues . Poland 's prospects of speeding its membership prospects will depend on who wins the internal EU argument between those who , with an eye to their energy supplies , want to see the conflict with Russia cool down and those who want to send a strong signal to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev , in that order , that they have already gone too far .
HANNOVER , Germany -- Germany maintained the pressure on the Czech Republic in the race for top spot in Group D with a comfortable 4-0 win against Cyprus in Hannover . Lukas Podolski celebrates his goal as Germany cruised to a 4-0 victory over Cyprus . Both sides have already qualified for EURO 2008 but Germany showed no sign of letting up as Bayern Munich pair Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski struck either side of half-time to build on Clemens Fritz 's second-minute opener . Thomas Hitzlsperger added the fourth in the 82nd minute as Germany claimed their eighth win in the group to move level with the Czech Republic on 26 points . Germany were quick out of the blocks and celebrated their first goal after less than 120 seconds . Podolski 's determination paid off and he pulled the ball back from the goalline for Fritz to score with a far-post header . Klose added the second on 20 minutes , accepting a pass from the selfless Fritz in a central position and firing in from eight meters out . Podolski was Germany 's main threat , and he finally got the goal an excellent performance warranted when he turned in Klose 's low cross from the right eight minutes into the second half . The impressive Podolski turned provider for the final goal eight minutes from time , making a determined run to the goalline before squaring for Hitzlsperger , whose simple tap-in completed the scoring . Meanwhile , Arsenal midfielder Tomas Rosicky was among the goals for the Czech Republic as they beat neighbors Slovakia 3-1 in Prague to remain top of the group by virtue of their head-to-head with Germany . Germany conclude their qualifying campaign at home to Wales on Wednesday while the Czech Republic travel to Cyprus . Meanwhile , the Netherlands secured their place in the finals with a narrow 1-0 win over Luxembourg in Group G. Danny Koevermans scored the only goal for the Dutch two minutes before half time to seal their place in the finals alongside Romania -- who remain top of the group having already qualified , despite losing 1-0 to Bulgaria in Sofia . Spain beat Sweden 3-0 with goals by Joan Capdevila , Andres Iniesta and Sergio Ramos , while Northern Ireland maintained their slim chance of catching Sweden by beating Denmark 2-1 . David Healy scored the winning goal to set a European Championship qualifying record of 13 goals , overtaking Davor Suker 's 12-goal mark . Northern Ireland must now beat already-qualified Spain in Las Palmas on Wednesday and hope that Latvia can win in Sweden on the same night , if they are to reach the finals . E-mail to a friend
WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- -- Federal officials have fined Exxon Mobil more than $ 6 million after it violated a three-year-old agreement to decrease air pollution at four of its refineries . Exxon Mobil 's refinery in Baytown , Texas , is one of four that the EPA said had high sulfur emissions . The Justice Department announced Wednesday that the oil giant agreed to pay $ 6.1 million after Environmental Protection Agency officials determined the company had not sufficiently reduced sulfur emissions in its refineries in Baytown and Beaumont , Texas ; Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; and Torrance , California . Exxon Mobil had paid a $ 7.7 million fine in its original 2005 agreement with the government and promised to install new emissions controls at the refineries . The petroleum company said after the latest settlement its refineries now meet the required EPA standards on sulfur emissions . The company 's role in environmental pollution has been in the spotlight ever since the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska , the worst oil spill in U.S. history . This past summer , the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the company to pay $ 507 million in punitive damages from the incident , down from an original $ 2.5 billion judgment .
New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After the Alzheimer 's came , my mother could not know how shadows fell across our once ebullient family : our solidarity fractured , our tempers flaring in furious incomprehension , hearts breaking in mute despair . None of us knew how to watch this woman disappear , her features slowly masked with blankness , her supple body rigid and wooden , her absolute vividness obliterated by the heavy fog of her disease . As those of us touched in some way by Alzheimer 's know too well , the emotional , social and economic burden of this disease is nearly unbearable -- for individuals , for families and for our country : • 5.3 million Americans are living with Alzheimer 's disease ; a new case develops every 70 seconds . • One in eight people aged 65 and older has the disease , and the risk is even higher for those over 85 . • Today , 9.9 million people are caring for a family member with Alzheimer 's . • Alzheimer 's and other dementias cost Medicare , Medicaid and businesses $ 148 billion annually , a number that will grow quickly and substantially as baby boomers reach age 65 . Prevention . Cure . Hope . These are words seldom associated with Alzheimer 's disease . But groundbreaking scientific research and an opportunity for powerful collaborations could lead to discovery of the ultimate cure for Alzheimer 's disease : its prevention . I know this is so because my friend Dr. Karen Hsiao Ashe , an internationally renowned Alzheimer 's disease researcher at the University of Minnesota , has developed a research road map that calls for bringing together a group of the world 's foremost laboratory and clinical investigators in the field to make prevention a reality by 2020 . This achievable goal adds `` hope '' to the vocabulary of Alzheimer 's disease and holds the promise that my children and yours will never suffer its hardship . My son , Alec , is an artist like his late grandmother . His paintings are large and uncompromising , stunning in texture , original in design . He 's got the real thing . He 's got `` it , '' just as she had . But what if he also has something else , like the APOE-e4 gene , known to increase the risk of Alzheimer 's ? What if he is in line to inherit this devastating disease ? What I could barely endure happening to my mother , I know I could not possibly endure happening to my son . So , like my friend Karen , I embrace prevention as the ultimate cure for Alzheimer 's disease . Anything short of that is too risky . Karen is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost-effective , widely available interventions . She compares Alzheimer 's disease prevention to the polio vaccine : `` Had a vaccine not been developed for polio , hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe . Similarly , not only is treatment of Alzheimer 's likely to be less effective than prevention , it 's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive , '' she recently told Twin Cities Business magazine . Karen and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility : a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to Alzheimer 's . So what 's the holdup ? Well , money , of course , and attitude , perhaps . Finding a treatment within the next 10 years that will prevent Alzheimer 's disease will require a major national investment to bring together the scientists to develop an effective , safe and affordable way to block the disease . According to Harry Johns , president and CEO of the Alzheimer 's Association , `` No other disease causes so much suffering , is so certainly fatal , affects so many and drives so much cost with so little spent to overcome it . '' Why is that ? Johns names ignorance , age discrimination , stigma and denial as likely explanations . My plea is deeply personal , but by 2050 , Alzheimer 's will affect as many as 16 million Americans , and none of us will be able to deny the reality . We must fight mightily now to prevent the shadow of this disease from darkening the lives of our children and grandchildren . We must invest today in research that will most swiftly lead to the ultimate cure : prevention . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kate Mulgrew .
MUMBAI , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- India 's Home Minister Shivraj Patil submitted his resignation Sunday as the country investigated alleged Pakistani ties to the terrorist attacks that killed 183 people in Mumbai . Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil addresses the media after a cabinet meeting with PM Manmohan Singh . The fallout from the attacks is damaging the tenuous relationship between India and Pakistan , said CNN 's sister station in India , CNN-IBN . The Indian government is considering suspending the five-year-old cease-fire with Pakistan and perhaps even ending the dialogue process with the country , sources told CNN-IBN . Pakistani security officials told CNN that if tensions with India escalate , Pakistan may shift its military forces from the Afghan border east to prepare for any conflict . The 60-hour wave of violence began Wednesday night as gunmen surged into at least nine locations in Mumbai , killing at least 183 people and wounding about 300 . The official death toll does not include at least 11 gunmen killed in battles with security forces . Authorities have said that some of the attackers , who arrived in Mumbai by boat , were from Pakistan . `` Yes , the captured terrorist was Pakistani , as the home minister and others have said . As far as the others , the accomplices , the investigation , the interrogation is under way and the details will become public very soon , '' said Vilasrao Deshmukh , chief minister of Maharashtra . Pakistan 's foreign minister , Shah Mahmood Qureshi , vowed Saturday to take action against any group within its borders if it is found to be involved with the attacks . Interpol had said it would send a delegation to India to aid in the investigation . But on Sunday , the international law enforcement agency was still waiting for official permission into the country , a spokesman said . `` We believe that time is of the essence in Interpol 's getting to India in order to explore any potential international links with regard to the seized evidence as well as the fingerprints and DNA of the suspected terrorists , '' a statement said . The resignation of India 's home minister could also slow down the agency 's being allowed into India , the statement said . Officials say they found telephones and a global navigational device on an abandoned boat floating off the coast of Mumbai that was used by the terrorists , CNN-IBN reported . The television network showed photographs of a phone 's call log that revealed calls had been placed to Pakistan . The boat had been hijacked , intelligence officials told CNN-IBN . Four crew members who had been on board were missing . The captain was found dead , face down with his hands bound behind his back . The targets of the attacks included luxury hotels packed with foreign tourists . The 105-year-old Taj Mahal hotel was the site of the attackers ' final stand , as gunmen held hostages and refused to leave the facility . Victims share their tales of survival and escape '' The chairman of the company that owns the hotel told CNN that the company had been warned about the possibility of a terrorist attack before the massacre . The hotel heightened security as a result , the chairman of the Tata Group and Taj Hotels , Ratan Tata , said in a taped interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN 's `` GPS . '' There were indications , though , that the hotel had relaxed security before the attack . `` It 's ironic that we did have such a warning and we did have some measures , '' Tata said . `` People could n't park their cars in the portico where you had to go through a metal detector . '' `` But if I look at what we had -- which all of us complained about -- it could not have stopped what took place . They did n't come through that entrance , '' he said . `` They came from somewhere in the back . They planned everything , '' he said of the attackers . `` I believe the first thing they did , they shot a sniffer dog and his handler . They went through the kitchen , they knew what they were doing . '' Watch the destruction left at the hotel '' The security response to the attacks has brought criticism and led to the resignation of Patil , the home minister . Patil , who had been widely criticized even before terrorists struck , submitted his resignation to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , a Home Ministry spokesman said . Singh accepted the resignation and immediately named Finance Minister P. Chidambaram to take over the Home Ministry post , according to a source in the prime minister 's office . N. Ram , editor-in-chief of The Hindu -- a major Indian newspaper -- said Patil 's departure was overdue . `` This man has been widely criticized for not being up to it and it was simply impossible that he could stay on after this , '' Ram said . The criticism of Patil was `` that he has been very slow , that they have n't delivered in the promise to improve intelligence . '' iReport.com : Share tributes to those lost The toll from the attacks is expected to rise as authorities count the casualties inside the Taj Mahal hotel , whose burned-out lobby was littered with shards of glass . At least 18 foreigners were among the victims , including five Americans and eight Israelis . Indian authorities found five bodies Friday of hostages at the Chabad House , a Jewish community center . The carnage could have been worse , investigators said . `` We found bullets with them , hand grenades , bombs , '' said R. R. Patil , deputy chief minister of Maharashtra state , where Mumbai is located . `` Based on our investigation , we believe they had planned to kill 5,000 people . '' President Bush spoke Sunday to Singh , the National Security Council said . Noting that U.S. citizens were among those killed , the president `` said that we would all be working together , with the international community , to go after these extremists , '' according to a statement from National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe . India 's major political parties Sunday held a five-hour meeting in which all involved pledged to find ways to strengthen security in the country and discussed a proposal to set up a federal investigation agency to look into the attacks , said External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee .

Although you may think that bottled water is a safer option than tap , two new reports show that the store-bought stuff is actually less regulated than the water you get out of your faucet for free . What 's in your water ? You may be hard pressed to find out , reports the Environmental Working Group . The Food and Drug Administration has little authority to regulate bottled brands , according to a U.S. Congressional report released recently . While municipal water utilities are required to provide public reports of test results , bottled-water makers are not . -LRB- On the other hand , well water , which is found in many rural areas , is n't regulated as water provided by towns and cities is . -RRB- So although you may fork over a pretty penny for bottled water , that does n't mean it 's any better than what 's coming out of your faucet . In fact , it could be worse and you 'd never know it . The new research is backed by a second report from the Environmental Working Group . The nonprofit advocacy organization surveyed the labels and Web sites of nearly 200 popular bottled-water brands and found that less than 2 percent disclosed three important facts that can affect safety : the water 's source , purification methods , and chemical pollutants in each bottle . -LRB- See the full report on bottled water at EWG 's Web site . -RRB- `` We 're really pushing for a consumer 's right to know what 's in their water , '' says Nneka Leiba , an environmental health researcher at the EWG . `` This is n't a doomsday scenario . It is n't that the claims are false ; it 's just that they are misleading . '' Reaching for the most popular bottled brands is n't necessarily a solution . In fact , the EWG report found that some of the best-known brands -- for example Whole Foods and San Pellegrino -- are the least likely to report where the water comes from and what it contains . Health.com : Plastic recycling gets easier `` This probably has to do with the fact that they 're imported , so the regulations are different , '' says Leiba . `` Some of the brands you think would n't be as transparent , like Walgreens or Sam 's Club , scored higher than many of the popular brands . '' So what 's a safety-conscious shopper to do ? In recent years , some reports have suggested that tap water could be contaminated by trace amounts of pharmaceuticals or other substances . Health.com : Why caffeine and sugar are poor substitutes for sleep Leiba says that activated carbon water filters -- like Brita pitchers or faucet attachments -- are a safe and affordable option for filtering tap water . If families can afford it , she recommends a reverse osmosis filter , which will eliminate all impurities . These reports come as food safety concerns seem to be at an all-time high . Lately , recalls of spinach , sprouts , peanut butter , and , most recently , cookie dough have made many consumers start to question the safety of the items they find on grocery-store shelves . Unlike tap water suppliers , bottled water companies do n't have to have their water tested by a certified laboratory , and they are n't required to notify customers within 24 hours if they find elevated levels of contaminants . The FDA does require bottled water companies to test for contaminants and other problems , says Joshua Sharfstein , M.D. , the agency 's principal deputy commissioner . Health.com : Could your rug make you sick ? If the companies fail , however , the public does n't get to see the actual test results . `` There 's clearly a difference in disclosure between municipal water and bottled water , but the FDA 's laws focus on safety of food more than on disclosure of information , '' says Sharfstein . `` It 's not a question of whether the FDA can do more ; it 's whether the government can do more through the food safety bill . '' Only changes in the current regulations would make it mandatory for manufacturers to make those kinds of records public , he says . Those regulations may change with the Food Safety Enhancement Act . Health.com : Drink this tea to lose that belly The proposed Food Safety Enhancement Act covers many aspects of food safety , including better preventive control measures by food manufacturers , more frequent inspections of facilities , and greater FDA authority over food recalls .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A tsunami watch issued for five nations after a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean was canceled about two hours later . A tsunami watch in effect after an earthquake in the Indian Ocean has been called off . The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had issued the watch for India , Myanmar , Thailand , Indonesia and Bangladesh after the quake , which struck at 1:55 a.m. Tuesday -LRB- 3:55 p.m. Monday ET -RRB- . Its epicenter was about 163 miles -LRB- 262 km -RRB- north of Port Blair in India 's Andaman Islands , and 225 miles south-southwest of Pathein , Myanmar , according to the U.S. Geological Survey . The earthquake 's focus was about 20 miles below the Earth 's surface . In general , earthquakes centered closer to the Earth 's surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground . Watch where the earthquakes hit '' `` Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated , '' the warning center said in a bulletin . `` Therefore , the tsunami watch issued by this center is now canceled .

The bears were sold at Build-A-Bear Workshops and through the firm 's website from April through December .
LA PAZ , Bolivia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After weeks of enduring cajoling and threats that culminated in a hunger strike by President Evo Morales , Bolivia 's congress on Tuesday approved a law allowing him to run for re-election in December . Evo Morales on hunger strike at the presidential palace in Bolivia 's capital , La Paz . Bolivia 's first indigenous president credited his five-day hunger strike for the decision , which came after an all-night debate . `` That effort has not been in vain , '' the leftist leader said as he approved the law , which calls for general elections to be held on December . 6 . The congress also approved a new census , seven parliamentary seats to be reserved for representatives of indigenous villages , and a referendum on autonomy for five resource-rich eastern regions and the eastern province of Gran Chaco . It also set April 4 , 2010 , for regional and municipal elections . For the opposition , the requirement of a new electoral census and tighter rules regarding who gets to vote was an important victory . `` It will give to all of us the assurance that our vote counts , that our vote will not be manipulated and that , therefore , we will define our future and the future of Bolivia , '' said Oscar Ortiz , a senator with the opposition Democratic Power party . But Jose Antonio Quiroga , a political analyst , predicted that the national electoral court will face big difficulties in deciding how the new census will affect who gets to vote -- both inside and outside the country . `` That 's an enormous job that must be decided not only by the electoral court , but the Office of Civil Registry , the National Police or perhaps the office of personal identification , which is where I believe the biggest problems will emerge , '' he said . The approval of the electoral law marked the end not only to days of political tension but to the hunger strike by Morales , who reportedly carried out an 18-day hunger strike in 2002 -- when he was expelled from Congress .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Erik Prince , the chairman and CEO of Blackwater USA , appeared Tuesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform . Erik Prince , CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA , is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional hearing . The committee convened amid an FBI investigation into a September 16 shootout involving Blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of Iraqi civilians . Following is a transcript of Prince 's opening statement : Chairman -LSB- Henry -RSB- Waxman , -LSB- D-California -RSB- , Congressman -LSB- Thomas -RSB- Davis , -LSB- R-Virginia -RSB- , members of the committee , my name is Eric Prince , and I am the chairman and CEO of the Prince Group and Blackwater USA . Blackwater 's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to America 's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect Americans in harm 's way overseas . Under the direction and oversight of the United States government , Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States . Words alone can not express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions . I am proud to be there to represent them today . After almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL , I founded Blackwater in 1997 . I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues . Ten years later , Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day . After 9/11 , when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq , the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas . Blackwater responded immediately . We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country . Blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans , many of whom have recent military deployments . No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured . There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men . At the same time , 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates . Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed . The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives . Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families . The areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging . Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq . We 're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis . Any incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe , including visiting members of Congress . In doing so , more American service members are available to fight the enemy . Blackwater shares the committee 's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations . The company 's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes , treaties and regulations of the United States . Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented . The worldwide personnel protection services contract , which has been provided to this committee , was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance , including the hiring , vetting guidelines , background checks , screening , training standards , rules of force and conduct standards . In Iraq , Blackwater reports to the embassy 's regional security officer , or RSO . All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO . In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls , the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions , as well as any applicable laws and regulations . We have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation 's total force . Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions . My understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation , but those results are not yet available . We at Blackwater welcome the FBI review announced yesterday , and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions . I just want to put some other things in perspective . A recent report from the Department of State stated that in 2007 Blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone , areas outside the Green Zone in Iraq , and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged , or less than 3 percent of all movements . In 2006 , Blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the Red Zone . Weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions . To the extent there is any loss of innocent life , ever , let me be clear that I consider that tragic . Every life , whether American or Iraqi , is precious . I stress to the committee and to the American public , however , that I believe we acted appropriately at all times . I am prepared to answer your questions . E-mail to a friend
ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Are you one of the seemingly few Americans in the market for a car ? There are more of you out there than you might think . Clark Howard : Before jumping at all the new car deals , think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs . CNW Marketing Research , a respected automotive marketing research firm , reports that 4 million used cars were purchased in the United States during the month of May alone . That 's amazing when you consider that the market for new cars is 9 million in the United States over the course of an entire 12 months . Yet do n't overlook the new car as a potential purchase just yet . New data from Comerica Bank 's Auto Affordability Index shows that new cars are now the most affordable they 've been since records started being kept in 1979 . In fact , the average new car is now $ 1,700 cheaper than it was during the last quarter of 2008 . And we 've got more price cuts coming because of oversupply . As you probably know , I 'm a used car guy , the self-proclaimed champion of driving a car until the wheels fall off . So I ca n't believe the advice that I am about to give ... but it 's now possible to get a better deal on a brand new car than on a relatively new used car . Watch Clark Howard talk to a woman who learned what not to do when buying a used car '' It 's really just a classic case of supply and demand . The used car market is up about 23 percent , and new car sales are down 34 percent , according to CNW . More new cars on dealer lots mean more deals for you . But realize this : It 's just a temporary phenomenon . Do not take this blip on the radar as gospel for the future ; in most instances , a used car will almost always be a better buy . Just not right now . When buying a new vehicle , you want to start by arranging your financing first . Go to your bank or credit union and prequalify for a car loan or apply online . This will tell you how much car you can afford and what type of monthly payment you will have to budget . Next , you want to get a price for the car you have in mind . In the past , I 've talked about using CarsDirect.com to get a guaranteed quote . A car dealer then can do his or her best to beat that online quote and win your business . In some cases , the price from CarsDirect.com winds up being the best a consumer can get . But now there 's a new kid on the block known as Zag.com . This service gives buyers instant guaranteed upfront prices from a network of certified dealers . It also offers an easy delivery process that helps you avoid `` the grind '' at a dealership . Do you know what `` the grind '' is ? That 's when you 're at a dealer lot , and the sales representative says he or she will go talk to the manager about getting you the best deal . Instead they go watch TV for five minutes , and then come back and tell you that the manager could n't help out with a good price -- despite their best efforts on your behalf . That 's why sites such as Zag and CarsDirect are so appealing ; they take you out of the car dealers ' ballpark and put you on level playing ground . But before you jump at all the new car deals , take a moment to think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs . It 's more than just the sticker price and the expense of gas . AAA reports that the true annual cost of owning and operating a car is $ 9,369 . Ouch . That $ 9,369 takes into account somewhat hidden costs such as insurance , maintenance , interest on a car note , depreciation and other factors . Hey , maybe driving your current car until the wheels fall off is still a great idea .
HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A child cries from hunger , but no tears come from her swollen eyes . A Zimbabwean family bury their relative , who died of cholera , 25km from Harare , Zimbabwe . Malnutrition has left this baby born in Zimbabwe fighting for her life . She is the face of an unfolding crisis in a country once known as Africa 's bread basket . Today a loaf of bread costs $ 35 million worthless Zimbabwean dollars , and people are forced to sift through garbage piles for any morsel of food . Others huddle for warmth around a fire burning inside the shell of a broken-down van . All of these images were captured on video recently smuggled out of Zimbabwe by Solidarity Peace Trust , a South African human rights group . Watch the disturbing images '' Zimbabwe 's government maintains that the situation is being exaggerated by the West in an effort to exert pressure on President Robert Mugabe to leave office . But the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- says the desperate situation has triggered a widening cholera outbreak that has killed 775 people and infected more than 15,000 . `` You have to eat in the same place you sleep right next to the buckets , the same buckets that we used as toilets , '' one cholera patient says on the video . `` There is no water to bathe . '' And little to eat . Women foraging for food in the bush find dry branches with only a few berries . `` This packet of juice will be my supper tonight , '' one woman says . Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai -- who is still trying to form a unity government with Mugabe under a recent power-sharing deal -- said the situation can only be addressed once a `` legitimate government '' is in place . `` Once there is a legitimate government , it is up to that government to deal with the problems the country is facing , which are quite wide-ranging , '' Tsvangirai told CNN on Wednesday . `` But the immediate intervention of the health crisis has exacerbated the situation to the extent that it has now become an international crisis . '' The WHO says the current cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has a high fatality rate because sufferers are either not able to reach health centers in time or that the health centers lack the capacity to treat the cases . `` The epidemic is clearly on the increase , '' Dr. Eric Laroche , a WHO official in Harare , told CNN on Wednesday . `` I think it 's going to last for several months . '' In addition to the WHO , the Red Cross has responded to the outbreak and is sending staff and medical supplies into Zimbabwe . Zimbabwe 's main hospitals have all but shut down and the small clinics equipped by international aid organizations are overcrowded and unable to cope with the thousands of cholera patients . Health workers inside Zimbabwe believe scores are dying at home . Laroche said the WHO is receiving cooperation from the government , but the health care system is abysmal . `` The quality of the care , the supplies that come inside Zimbabwe , also need to be restored , '' Laroche said . `` So there 's a lot of work to do , because the health system is collapsing for the time being . '' One Zimbabwean health care worker , who would not show his face on the video , said he fears the death toll will skyrocket . `` People are dying even at the health institution , '' he said . `` It 's beyond control . We are going to witness so many deaths in the coming weeks . '' He expressed frustration that so many people are dying from cholera , a disease that `` is both preventable and curable . '' `` Nobody should die from cholera , '' he said . `` We are quite unfortunate . '' Zimbabwe , already experiencing an economic crisis , was struck with the raging water-borne cholera in August . Health experts say the battle against the disease can only be won if Harare has adequate water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse properly . Zimbabwe 's information minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said Tuesday that the country has enough chemicals to purify water and enough money to buy pipes to mend sanitation lines . He maintained that the outbreak is under control , blaming the West for causing the crisis as an excuse for military intervention . International leaders -- including U.S. President George W. Bush , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , and Kenyan premier Raila Odinga -- have recently called for Mugabe to step down for failing to contain the cholera outbreak . Frustration inside Zimbabwe is building . Last week , doctors and nurses protested over the lack of medical supplies and other resources at the country 's hospitals . Labor unions have protested over the deteriorating economy . Even soldiers once shielded from economic hardships by the Mugabe regime went on a rampage last week when they were unable to access wages from the country 's banks . Human rights activist Elinor Sisulu , who has lived and worked in Zimbabwe and now coordinates civil action outside the country , called on African leaders to demand Mugabe step down before Zimbabwe explodes . `` In any population where you have high levels of desperation , anger and ... people arrive at the conclusion that we 've tried a peaceful political process and this is not working , then anything can happen , '' she said . -- CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg , South Africa contributed to this report .
LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Keri Russell , who stars in the new Adam Sandler comedy `` Bedtime Stories , '' says her own son is a little too young to enjoy a story before bedtime . Keri Russell , here with `` Bedtime Stories '' co-star Adam Sandler , has a young son . `` He 's too squiggly and little for that right now . He 's a year and a half , '' Russell tells CNN . She and husband Shane Deary have tried reading to their tot . `` We do read -LSB- him -RSB- books , and he has his favorites , but right now it 's very much like ` Read this one , read this one . ' And we read the first two pages , then he 's like , ` and now this one . ' I 'm like ` But we have n't gotten to the best part ! Let me finish . ' It 's a lot of that . '' Russell and Deary named their son River , which she acknowledges is unusual . `` It was a name we like , and my husband grew up on Martha 's Vineyard . It was a lot of sort of unusual hippie names , so we thought we could get away with it .

Russell offers a reason why some entertainers choose distinctive names for their children : It 's the nature of their work . `` It 's an unusual life . I mean , so there tend to be creative people , and maybe people are more creative with their names , too , '' she says . `` Or -LSB- they -RSB- feel like they do n't have to be so confined to tradition because it 's such an untraditional line of work .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With lessons learned from previous titles and a sense of finality to the franchise , `` Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception '' exceeds expectations with a wonderful storyline , dynamic action and witty dialogue from its characters . The latest in the franchise from Naughty Dog , `` Uncharted 3 '' returns to follow hero Nathan Drake on yet another historical adventure that promises fortune and glory but invariably involves a lot of danger . As in games past , Nathan is a treasure hunter who follows clues to find lost riches in far-off lands and gets help from other characters in his missions . The game 's storyline follows the path of `` Seven Pillars of Wisdom , '' the T.E. Lawrence book that inspired the epic movie `` Lawrence of Arabia . '' Amy Henning , the writer for the `` Uncharted '' series , pulls elements from Lawrence 's book and weaves them into a stunning narrative about Nathan 's search for a lost city called Iram of the Pillars . Keith Guerrette , lead visual effects artist from Naughty Dog , said Henning really opened up the characters in the game and delves deeply into Nathan 's past as well as his connections to his companions . While some of the story is told in flashbacks , it never feels disjointed or out of place and flows with the action in the game . The pace , for the most part , is quick and occurs over several different types of environments . From a vast desert to historical chateaus , the scenes are beautifully rendered and help deepen the moment . There were a couple of missions that bogged down the story in places , but those were few and far between . Many times , I felt like I was in an `` Indiana Jones '' movie . There were moments when the gameplay was very similar to what I 've seen on the big screen . For example , one mission had me chasing after a caravan transporting my longtime friend , Victor Sullivan , through a narrow cavern in a scene that was reminiscent of `` Raiders of the Lost Ark. '' Like Dr. Jones , Nathan has to solve puzzles and use his journal to reference solutions . The puzzles were not extremely challenging once the clues in the journal were deciphered . There are other little touches that are Jones-esque , but they add to the story rather than taking away from it . The action is high adventure with a twist of humor and whimsy along the way . The dialogue helps keep the mood light as character banter flows naturally and feels like what it is -- conversations between people who do n't take themselves too seriously but have experienced life-changing events . There is humor , caring , concern and sarcasm that one would expect from longtime friends . It feels natural and gets the player emotionally involved . `` We 've been building up to this one , '' Guerrette said . `` We went in thinking , ` How can we take our tech and art and make them even better ? ' '' There are subtle effects in the environment , like shadows from a fire , ripples in water and disappearing footprints in sand . But the most dynamic action fills the screen during intense missions in which Nathan takes on his enemies while the background moves . Much of Nathan 's movement occurs along the sides and rooftops of buildings , like the `` Assassin 's Creed '' games . That motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around . The game 's combat has been fine-tuned but still seemed uneven at times . Guerrette said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles . Melee was improved -LRB- I enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies -RRB- and moving while firing is nearly mandatory . Stealth has become a more effective tool in some missions . There was one mission , however , where I used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that I could not stealth kill . It was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance . Targeting specific areas on enemies also did n't seem to matter . There were times when I shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down . Yet it would take the same number of shots to an enemy 's arm to get him to collapse . Nathan can also throw back grenades that are tossed his way . The audio is funny , but the effects are devastating . A split-screen co-op version -LRB- a fan request -RRB- offers a unique story with the chance to unlock multiplayer bonuses and skills . This version can be played either on or offline . The multiplayer version also features improved cinematic techniques , boosters and the ability to upload great -LRB- or not-so-great -RRB- gameplay moments into social media platforms . A buddy system can be used for cooperative play in multiplayer mode , or you can go it alone during competitive play . `` Uncharted 3 '' is an outstanding adventure game that gives you a feature-film feeling . The environments are open and interactive . The story is unique and fresh . And the characters are portrayed in ways that make them feel real and emotional . While developers would n't say if this was the final act for Nathan Drake , there are moments in the game that answer lingering questions from previous games . Those are the `` aha '' moments that put an extra shine on a wonderful game . If this is the end , `` Uncharted 3 '' provides a fitting conclusion with an immersive game that keeps players invested until the final treasure is obtained . Popcorn not included .
Editor 's note : The U.S. Marshals Service last week launched one of the largest weeklong fugitive sweeps in the southeastern United States . CNN takes you inside the operation . Authorities received a tip that a convicted child molester was living here . He was captured at a hardware store . ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The trail for the convicted child molester seemed to grow cold as the police combed his empty apartment . James Maurice Robinson , 25 , a confessed sex offender , had been on the run for more than two years , and it looked as if he would elude capture yet again . The authorities huddled in a nearby parking lot to discuss Plan B , an air of disgust hanging over them . James Ergas , the U.S. Marshal helping to lead this operation , acts on a tip . He pulls out his cell phone and calls a hardware store where the suspect may be working . Using a ruse , he begins speaking to the manager and , at one point , Robinson himself gets on the phone and unknowingly talks to the very man trying to catch him . Gotcha ! Authorities now know exactly where their man is . He 's seven miles away , on the other side of town . It 's 11:02 a.m. Ergas guns his unmarked sport utility vehicle at 95 miles per hour through downtown Atlanta , zipping in and out of the city 's notorious traffic congestion . Hear cops bang door , see raid on a home : `` Get down ! '' '' `` I 've got no place in my heart for pedophiles , '' he says , pressing down harder on the gas . The vehicle thrusts forward . Ten minutes later , he whips his SUV into the store 's parking lot . The suspect 's car , a burgundy , four-door Pontiac Grand Am , sits near a back stairwell . `` When we go in there , he 's going to run out the back , '' Ergas says . He parks near the front of the building and alerts his backup . Within minutes , the full team arrives . Two take position near the back stairwell . Ergas and other team members , dressed in black flak jackets , enter the front door at 11:19 a.m. Robinson does n't have a chance . He tries to run , but slips . Ergas points his Taser and prepares to zap him . Robinson knows his gig is up . He surrenders peacefully . `` He saw the Taser , '' Ergas says , with a smile . `` Nobody wants to be Tased . '' More than 100 miles away , the man who first arrested Robinson in March 2004 gets word of the capture . `` Anytime we can get a pervert off the street like that , it 's going to make me happy , '' said Robert Tate , a detective with the LaFayette Police Department in northwest Georgia , near the Tennessee border . Robinson had been accused of exposing himself to a 10-year-old boy in a Wal-Mart bathroom and masturbating in front of him . Police records indicate the boy was so petrified he was afraid to leave the stall for 15 minutes afterward . Robinson pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation on May 26 , 2005 , according to the Walker County District Attorney 's Office . But he skipped town and never made his sentencing hearing on February 14 , 2006 , authorities said . A warrant was then issued for his arrest . Robinson now faces five to 20 years in prison , the DA 's office said . Robinson was one of 1,250 fugitives busted in Georgia last week as part of Operation Falcon , a nationwide sweep to arrest some of the most violent offenders . Of the arrests in Georgia , 724 came in metro Atlanta ; two were suspected killers , authorities said . Multiple sweeps like these have already taken place in other cities in recent weeks as part of Falcon . More are coming to undisclosed regions of the country . Authorities would not release further details about the nationwide hunt due to the ongoing nature of the operation . `` Our primary focus when we do this operation are violent offenders , sex offenders and gang members , '' says Keith Booker , the commander of the U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force leading this sweep that included 115 federal , state and local agencies . The fugitives were wanted on felony charges ranging from murder and aggravated assault to rape and armed robbery to child molestation and an array of parole violations . On this day , while Ergas and his eight - to 10-member team hit multiple spots where fugitives were believed to be living , another 150 agents , investigators , detectives , officers and deputies were working other parts of metro Atlanta . Of the 700-plus arrests made around Atlanta , authorities smashed through 154 doors . Not every suspect was captured , but the hunt generated leads that will be followed up . The work involved grueling and dangerous 14 - to 18-hour days , but the officers still found time to laugh . There was one who Tasered himself while running after a suspect , and another who held up a bag of oregano thinking it was pot and quizzed his subjects . Both provided fodder for the watercooler . Then , there was the suspect wanted for aggravated assault who authorities said tried to jump over a 30-foot wall , breaking several bones when he landed . `` He did n't want to go to jail . Instead , he went to jail crippled , '' Ergas said . The police kept close tabs on the six different teams ' arrests , an internal competition to see who could bag more wanted felons . Team Vulture beat out Team Osprey with 147 arrests to 132 . At the end of the operation , about 80 officers crowded into a large conference room and were briefed on the final results . `` You prevented a lot of victims this week , '' Booker told them . Law enforcement studies , he said , indicate the typical fugitive commits an average of 13 crimes while they 're on the run . If that 's true , more than 15,000 potential victims have been spared . `` These people ca n't commit crimes against other people while they 're locked up , '' Booker said .
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A dispute over abortion between the only remaining Kennedy in Congress and his Roman Catholic bishop has highlighted the political volatility of the issue and the challenge it presents to the nation 's Catholics . `` How can you claim to be a Catholic and also support abortion ? '' Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence , Rhode Island , asked Monday , discussing his request that Rep. Patrick Kennedy , a Rhode Island Democrat , stop receiving Holy Communion because of his pro-choice politics . Kennedy went public Sunday about Tobin 's request , originally made in a private letter to Kennedy in 2007 . Tobin responded with a statement Sunday followed by his television appearance Monday , in which he acknowledged holding Kennedy to a higher standard than an ordinary parishioner because of the congressman 's position as a legislator who can shape abortion laws and policy . The issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men . A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language , with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House . Kennedy , a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history , is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy , the nation 's first Catholic president . When running for president in 1960 , John Kennedy famously said he was `` not the Catholic candidate for president , '' but `` the Democratic Party 's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic . '' Edward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies , including support for a woman 's right to choose an abortion . When he died earlier this year , a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston 's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica . Patrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father , and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language . Requests to Kennedy 's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered . Tobin , appearing on CNN , called Kennedy 's support of abortion `` a scandal . '' Asked why he was singling out Kennedy , Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church 's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions . He acknowledged `` a difference between someone who is the average Catholic in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high-profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion . '' Other Catholics questioned Tobin 's stance . `` The simple fact is that most bishops do n't want to deny communion to politicians , and we know for a fact that Pope John Paul II gave communion to pro-choice Italian politicians , '' said the Rev. Thomas Reese , a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University . `` So the question is , is Bishop Tobin more Catholic than the pope on this ? '' Politicians have previously run afoul of Catholic bishops on the abortion issue . Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann asked Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to stop receiving communion when she was a pro-choice governor of Kansas , and former St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke said in 2004 he would deny communion to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry for being pro-choice . Brian McLaren , a longtime Christian pastor who has written a book coming out next year called `` A New Kind of Christianity , '' said politicizing religious views limits the perception and , eventually , the impact of a church 's teachings . `` Both Catholics and Protestants have allowed themselves to be pushed into this kind of binary , either-or thinking '' on abortion and homosexuality , McLaren said . `` It 's disturbing for me as a non-Catholic to see the Catholic Church possibly risking its moral authority on a number of other issues by only focusing on abortion . '' The Roman Catholic church strongly opposes abortion , which has been legal across the United States since 1973 . The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops lobbied for tight restrictions on federal funding of abortion in the health care bill the House passed earlier this month . In an October interview , Kennedy criticized the bishops for threatening to oppose the health care bill if it lacked the tough restrictions . In the House debate on the measure , Kennedy opposed a provision with the church-backed restrictions on federal money for abortions , but voted in favor of final passage of the bill that included that language . He repeated that criticism and revealed Tobin 's earlier admonition in an interview published Sunday , the 46th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy . Tobin responded by calling Kennedy 's position `` unacceptable to the church and scandalous to many of our members . '' Most bishops and priests oppose using communion as a `` political weapon , '' and Kennedy 's disclosure of Tobin 's admonition may be an attempt to push back against the bishops ' support for the abortion restrictions in the House bill , CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen said . `` The Catholic bishops have been fairly successful , at least to date , at putting abortion at the center of the debate over health care reform , and that obviously has generated some resentment from people who do n't share their views , '' Allen said . Kennedy 's decision to come forward `` in effect puts the Catholic bishops in a negative light , because it ends up making them look intolerant . '' To McLaren , the admonishment by Tobin displays an inconsistency . `` The bishops have taken I think a wise stand against the proliferation of nuclear weapons , '' he said . `` Would they apply withholding of the Eucharist to someone who supports increasing nuclear stockpiles ? '' The health care debate reveals the depth of division on the issue , according to McLaren . Both sides apparently believe they are advocating language that makes the legislation effectively `` abortion neutral , '' meaning it does n't change existing abortion law . `` What we discovered is ` abortion neutral ' is a matter of interpretation , '' McLaren said , adding : `` This is what happens in the politics of polarization . Each side plays to its more extreme base . It makes common ground and respectful dialogue harder to achieve . The idea that we 're playing a win-lose game , that you 're saying if you do n't agree with us , we 're not even going to have a conversation with you , that attitude chills civil discourse . ''

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 9-year-old girl was laid to rest Wednesday as a 15-year-old girl , described as an acquaintance , was in court on charges she carried out the younger girl 's murder Elizabeth Olten was coming home from a friend 's house last week in St. Martins , Missouri , when she disappeared . Distraught residents searched for days for Olten without luck , when the Cole County Sheriff 's Department received a tip that led them to the alleged killer . It did n't lead them to a stranger , a child predator or a convicted sex offender -- avenues police had originally considered because of Olten 's age Instead , it led them to a 15-year-old girl who , according to Peggy Florence , a family spokeswoman , had played with Olten . The girl then led police to the body -- which was found in an area authorities searched before , the sheriff 's department said , but was hidden so well they had n't seen it . Authorities said both physical evidence and some written evidence led to the suspect 's arrest . She has been charged with first-degree murder . On Wednesday , Olten 's family looked towards closure as two drastically different scenes unfolded in Missouri . Olten 's family and friends watched as two white horses pulled her casket in a glass hearse . Hours earlier , a judge had ordered the 15-year-old suspect to be held while he decides whether she should be tried in adult court . Authorities have not released the suspect 's name . Authorities released few details about the case , though they said an autopsy was conducted Saturday . The Olten family spent the day of Elizabeth 's funeral remembering a very special little girl and mourning their loss , choosing to celebrate her life , instead of attending the court hearing of the teen accused of killing her . After the funeral ceremony , they released pink balloons , in honor of Elizabeth Olten 's favorite color . For them , it was about their little girl -- the one who was always ready with a bright smile . `` She wanted to be a mother , she wanted to love others and take care of others , '' family spokeswoman Florence told HLN 's Nancy Grace . `` She was just a lovely child -- she never met an animal she did n't love and dress up and play with . '' She loved to dress up and put on fancy dresses , Florence said , even in the snow and the mud . `` She was a beautiful little girly girl , '' Florence said . `` She had everyone 's heart . ''
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- John `` Junior '' Gotti , son of the late Gambino family mob boss John Gotti , was arrested in New York on Tuesday and faces a number of federal charges including racketeering , conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking , authorities said . John `` Junior '' Gotti , seen in September 2006 , has had three criminal trials end in mistrials . Gotti was among six people indicted by a Florida grand jury , said Robert O'Neill , U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida . The indictments were unsealed Tuesday with the arrest of five defendants , including Gotti , he said . Negotiations were under way for the surrender of the sixth person named in the indictment , O'Neill said . All six suspects were charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , or RICO , a law used to target organized crime groups -- in this case , the Gambino crime family . Gotti appeared Tuesday afternoon before a judge , who ordered him held without bail . His attorney , Charles Carnesi , told reporters the charges against his client were baseless . `` I can guarantee you that this case will be based on people who have been convicted of various crimes who do not want to go to jail , '' Carnesi said outside the courthouse . `` Let 's face it , they have the money , they have the resources , they have an army of agents and most of all they have the ability to go to people who are willing to lie and say , ` OK , here 's the key . Here 's the way out . ' '' Watch authorities talk about ` significant evidence ' Â '' The indictment alleges Gotti was involved in three slayings in New York City -- those of George Grosso , who died in December 1988 in Queens ; Louis DiBono , killed in October 1990 in the parking garage of the former World Trade Center ; and Bruce John Gotterup , slain in November 1991 at the Boardwalk at the Rockaways in Queens . Gotti is the first person charged in Grosso 's death , which was listed as an unsolved homicide and was investigated with assistance from the New York Police Department 's Cold Case Squad , O'Neill said in a written statement . Gotti is charged in one indictment , and the five others in another one . Watch Gotti being led away in handcuffs Carnesi said he was surprised by the judge 's decision to hold Gotti without bail . He said it would be his preference to keep Gotti in New York as long as possible `` so that we can maintain contact with him '' and suggested he enter his not-guilty plea by video to the Florida court . Gotti , 44 , of Oyster Bay , New York , has served as an associate , soldier , captain and de facto boss in the organization , the indictment alleges , as well as a member of a captains ' committee formed in the early 1990s to assist in the administration of the family . His co-defendants are John Burke , 47 , a New York prison inmate ; James Cadicamo , 33 , of Tampa , Florida ; David D'Arpino , 33 , of Howard Beach , New York ; Michael Finnerty , 43 , of Oceanside , New York ; and Guy Peden , 47 , of Wantagh , New York . Burke and Peden are also accused of participating in the murder of Gotterup , according to authorities , and Burke and D'Arpino are charged in the death of John Gebert , who was killed in 1996 in Queens . In addition , Cadicamo is charged with conspiring to beat or kill a man named Michael Malone to prevent Malone 's testimony in a case , and with retaliating against Malone for his cooperation with authorities . A number of cases culminated in the indictment , which names people in Florida and New York , the prosecutor said . `` I think what you have here is , you have the Gambino crime family reaching out to Tampa , Florida '' and `` trying to gain a foothold , '' he said . All six defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison , authorities said . If convicted of the charges involving Malone , Cadicamo could face the death penalty . '' -LSB- Gambino crime family -RSB- enterprise members engaged in public acts and displays of violence -- shootings , stabbings , baseball bat beatings and murder -- designed to create and maintain fear and dread in others so that the GCF enterprise could defend and expand its unlawful dominion and influence in certain geographical areas , '' according to a statement issued by O'Neill 's office . `` GCF enterprise members worked to establish and maintain GCF enterprise footholds , or operational bases , in various parts of the United States of America , specifically including the city of Tampa , Florida . '' The Gambino family also is accused of crimes including robbery , bribery , kidnapping , extortion , home invasions and money laundering , among others , authorities said . Members of the organization `` invested some of their criminal income for the acquisition of interests in other businesses , '' including window and glass businesses , valet parking businesses and bars or nightclubs , prosecutors allege . Carnesi questioned why , if Gotti is involved in drug trafficking and murder , informants such as Sammy `` The Bull '' Gravano have never suggested it . `` You can go down the line as to any of these individuals who made deals with the government . ... They do n't know anything of this , '' he said . In late 2006 , a third mistrial was declared in a federal racketeering case against Gotti . Charges against him included racketeering and extortion . Prosecutors said they would not retry Gotti , who was accused of ordering attacks on radio talk show host Curtis Sliwa after the Guardian Angels founder criticized Gotti 's father on his radio show . Sliwa was shot three times but recovered and testified against Gotti . Asked Gotti 's feelings on the newest charges , Carnesi said , `` He was very disappointed to have to go through all this again . You can imagine the toll it took on him and his family to have to fight three times in the course of a year , to feel that , OK , perhaps it 's over ... because the government itself came to the conclusion , no more . It 's very disheartening for him to be back here again . '' Gotti 's father , who was nicknamed the `` Teflon Don '' because prosecutors had trouble making charges stick against him , died in prison in 2002 of throat cancer .

Mecca , Saudi Arabia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chanting `` Allahu Akbar '' -- God is Greater than any -- more than 2 million pilgrims crossed new pedestrian bridges Saturday to perform one of the last rituals of the Hajj season . Jamarat is a re-enactment of an event when Prophet Abraham stoned the devil and rejected his temptations , according to Muslim traditions . The ritual stoning of three pillars , which occurs in the tent city of Mina -- about two miles from Mecca , was the scene of stampedes and many deaths in the 1980s and 1990s as pilgrims passed a crowded bottleneck area leading to the small pillars on the ground . But this year the Saudi government completed a new project that avoids past congestion at the site . The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $ 1.2 billion , five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones . Authorities and pilgrims say it 's a roomier atmosphere and more efficient way to accommodate the faithful . `` Everything went fine so far , '' Col. Khakled Qarar Mohammadi , head of the emergency forces at Jamarat , told CNN . `` It is an immense responsibility that we had to deal with . About 3 million pilgrims move in a small geographic area at the same time wanting to do the same ritual . So we have been preparing for this for years now . '' Irtiza Hasan , a pilgrim from the United States , said all went well at the ceremony . `` The only incident I saw was that there were some handicapped women who were turned away in fears that they get hurt . '' But Mohammadi said , `` There are 10 vans on the second floor especially designated to serve the elderly and handicapped . Each van can take up to 14 pilgrims . '' As a measure to alleviate harm , according to Muslim traditions , the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them . The five-story Jamarat bridge is air-conditioned at 19 degrees Centigrade , or 66 Fahrenheit , throughout the day and backed by water sprinklers that can reduce the temperature to about 29 degrees C , or 84 F . The bridge is designed to allow the addition of seven more levels to hold as many as 5 million pilgrims in the future if the need arises . According to authorities , the bridge is 950 meters -LRB- 1,039 yards -RRB- long and 80 meters -LRB- 87 yards -RRB- wide . Each floor is 12 meters -LRB- 13 yards -RRB- high with three tunnels and 12 entrances and 12 exits in six directions . It has a helicopter pad for emergencies . According to Mohammadi , the project has 509 advanced closed-circuit television cameras monitoring pilgrims ' movements . Those cameras feed into the main operations room , which oversees the Jamarat Bridge and the surrounding areas -- all screened by dozens of security officers on 72 monitors at the operation room . The stoning ritual is done over at least two days , where pilgrims stone three pillars at Mina -- believed to be where the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying God 's orders to slaughter his son . According to tradition , the event was a test from God , who gave Abraham a ram to slaughter instead . The last ritual that marks the end of Hajj is when pilgrims go from Mina to Mecca to make a last visit to al-Masjid al-Haram , Islam 's holiest site , before going back home . The ritual is called Tawaf al-Wada ' a -- or farewell circumambulation in the holy mosque . It 's where pilgrims go around the black cube seven times counter-clockwise asking that their Lord accept their pilgrimage and grant them another visit to the holy city .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police have recovered two of the four Impressionist paintings stolen earlier this month in a daring museum heist , police in Zurich , Switzerland said Tuesday . Claude Monet 's `` Poppies near Vetheuil '' has been recovered by Swiss police . The Monet and van Gogh oil paintings were in good condition , police said , and the search continued for the other two -- a Cezanne and a Degas . A parking lot attendant at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich found the paintings Monday afternoon in the back of an unlocked white car , police said . It was not clear how long the car , an Opel Omega with stolen license plates , had been parked on the lot , police said . `` The two paintings , worth about 70 million francs -LRB- $ 64 million -RRB- , are in good condition and are still protected by the original glass covering , '' police said in a statement . Three masked men stole the four paintings in what police called a `` spectacular '' heist Feb. 11 at the E.G. Buhrle Collection -- among the finest collections of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art in the world . One of the men threatened personnel at the museum 's front door with a pistol and forced them to the ground , police said , while the other two men went into an exhibition room and stole four oil paintings by Paul Cezanne , Edgar Degas , Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh . Afterward , the three men loaded the paintings into a white car parked in front of the museum and then drove off , police said . The paintings recovered Monday are Monet 's `` Poppies near Vetheuil '' and van Gogh 's `` Blossoming Chestnut Branches . '' Still missing are Degas ' `` Count Lepic and his Daughters '' and Cezanne 's `` Boy in a Red Vest . '' The four paintings are worth a total of about $ 163 million -LRB- 180 million Swiss francs -RRB- . A reward of $ 91,000 -LRB- 100,00 Swiss francs -RRB- has been posted for information leading to the return of the paintings , police said . A Zurich police task force , which includes an art expert , had received tips from around the world , police said . The task force was looking into possible connections with other art thefts inside Switzerland and abroad . The Zurich heist followed the recent theft in Switzerland of two paintings by Pablo Picasso , said Bjoern Quellenberg , a spokesman for the Kunsthaus , another major art museum in Zurich . The director of the Kunsthaus serves on the E.G. Buhrle private art foundation 's council , Quellenberg said . In that theft , thieves stole the 1962 `` Tete de Cheval '' -LRB- `` Horse 's Head '' -RRB- and the 1944 `` Verre et Pichet '' -LRB- `` Glass and Pitcher '' -RRB- by Picasso . They were on loan from a German museum and valued at $ 4.5 million when they were stolen February 6 , according to news reports . E-mail to a friend
WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The number of illegal immigrants arrested along U.S. borders dropped 23 percent during the past nine months -- evidence , officials said , that stepped-up enforcement is working . Mexican families swim and wash cars along the banks of the Rio Grande at the U.S. border in Juarez in June . The Border Patrol captured 695,841 people nationwide in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007 , down from 907,445 for the same period the previous fiscal year , or a 23 percent drop , said Border Patrol spokesman Michael Friel . Arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border declined by 24 percent , he said . Border Patrol officials said the reasons for the change are varied and complex , but Friel said , `` We 're clearly seeing a deterrent . '' One factor cited by officials is the end of the practice of releasing non-Mexican immigrants , pending court hearings . The Border Patrol captured 50,349 non-Mexican illegal immigrants nationwide in the nine-month period ending June 30 , down from 89,952 during the same period of fiscal 2006 . That 's a 44 percent decrease . The decrease was 48 percent for non-Mexican illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border . Other factors include the 6,000 National Guard troops patrolling along the Southwest border , more detention space and enhanced enforcement in the interior , Friel said . Outside economic , political and social factors also are `` always involved '' in fluctuating levels of immigrants seeking entry into the United States , he said . Last month , opponents effectively killed President Bush 's long-fought and emotion-laden immigration bill in the Senate when members voted against advancing the legislation . The bill aimed to create a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million illegal immigrants and to toughen border security . Supporters and opponents of the legislation said that it probably wo n't be resurrected until the 2008 elections are over . E-mail to a friend CNN 's Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Smoking is bad for you , and by now , most of us know it . An estimated 4.5 million U.S. adolescents are cigarette smokers . It seems that studies on the dangers of smoking come out every week . Just recently , after an article appeared in the journal Pediatrics , we were introduced to the concept of third-hand smoke , the potentially toxic residue that lingers in curtains , clothing , hair , etc. after the smoke itself blows away . To recap : Smoking exponentially increases your risk of developing lung cancer -LRB- and other lung diseases , like emphysema and chronic bronchitis -RRB- and puts you at higher risk for cancer of the mouth , throat , larynx , esophagus , bladder , pancreas , kidney , cervix and stomach . Smoking also elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease , stroke and insulin resistance . And , as if all that were n't bad enough , it causes wrinkles . Yet stand on virtually any streetcorner of any city or town in the United States , and you will see people smoking . So , who exactly -- in the face of all the mounting scientific evidence , social stigma and legal bans -- still lights up ? According to the CDC , about 43.4 million Americans -LRB- 19.8 percent of the population -RRB- smoke . Look around you . If you are in Kentucky , the state with the highest smoking rate , more than one out of every four people -LRB- 28.3 percent -RRB- around you smokes . On the other end of the spectrum is Utah , with just over one person in 10 -LRB- 11.7 percent -RRB- a smoker . Find the smoking rate in your state '' Here 's the good news : `` Smoking prevalence in the entire country has gone under 20 percent for first time in over 50 years , '' said Dr. Richard Hurt , director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic . `` For women , it 's 18 percent in most places , and for men it 's hovering at about 20 percent . We have gone from one in two men smoking to one in five -- a very dramatic change -- and one in three women to one in five . '' Here 's the bad news : Smoking rates are unlikely to drop to the national health objective of 12 percent by 2010 . Hurt , who is also a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester , Minnesota , is a former three-pack-a-day smoker . Unlike most smokers , he picked up the habit during college ; according to the CDC , about 90 percent of heavy smokers start in high school . And studies show that the younger you are when you start , the more likely you 'll become a heavy smoker as an adult . According to the American Cancer Society , each day more than 3,500 people younger than 18 try their first cigarette , and 1,100 others become regular daily smokers . About one-third of these kids will eventually die from a smoking-related disease . Retired radio broadcaster and iReporter Gerald Dimmitt , 65 , has smoked since he was 14 . `` I 've always smoked a pipe , '' he said . `` I have successfully quit about 40 times . '' But , he says , he always restarted , because `` it calms me down . '' iReport.com : Do you still smoke ? Dimmitt has even more incentive to quit now , since developing lesions and irritation in his mouth . After speaking to his doctor , he received a prescription for Chantix , a pill to aid with smoking cessation . But when he went to pick up his prescription at the pharmacy , he was charged $ 139 -LRB- because it 's not generic -RRB- for two weeks worth . Outraged , he left the Chantix behind . `` If smoking is so dangerous ... why then do they want to charge $ 139 to make me stop ? There is something very wrong with that . I guess they would rather pay to take care of lung cancer , '' he said . Some would-be smokers pick up their first cigarette to fit in . `` I started smoking at 12 years old to be part of the ` in ' crowd . It never got me into the ` in ' crowd , but with my first cigarette , I was totally hooked , '' wrote Lori Jerome , 45 , a former bartender and now full-time university student from Canada . Said Lisa `` Smith , '' 44 , a recently laid-off administrator from Minnesota , `` I began smoking in junior high school because I wanted to fit in with a certain crowd . However , that group of friends is looooong gone from my life and I still have the nasty habit . '' Smith did n't want her last name used . Hurt says the reason many people start , and continue , is peer influence . But he also blames targeted promotions by tobacco companies -LRB- like Virginia Slims targeting women in the 1970s and other brands targeting inner-city minority groups today -RRB- and the movies . `` There is a lot of research right now that shows that smoking in the movies has made a comeback . ... It clearly affects start-up smoking among young people . '' As for things that prevent children from smoking , Hurt cites higher cigarette taxes and smoke-free zones , like offices and restaurants . `` Those two public health policies do three things : reduce smoking among continuing smokers , help people to stop smoking and reduce the chances of our children starting to smoke , because it de-normalizes it . ... The child interprets smoke-free as the social norm , '' he said . That 's why children of smokers are much more likely to become smokers themselves : Smoke-filled surroundings is their norm . Of course , society 's perception of smoking has changed a lot since the days of doctors actually endorsing one brand or another in the first half of last century . Dimmitt recalls `` ashtrays in church pews , smoking in the classroom and blowing pipe smoke all over the students ! '' `` When I was born , my mother was allowed to smoke in the hospital room with me in there , '' Jerome said . `` When I had my adult children , we were allowed to smoke in the day room on the maternity ward floor , although the babies were not allowed in there . When I had my youngest children , ages 5 and 8 now , you could n't smoke in the hospital . How the times have changed . '' Now , smokers in some places face smoking bans in certain public and private spaces , and unspoken -- and sometimes overt -- hostilities . Smith , a mother of six , wrote , `` It 's so socially unacceptable where I live , and none of my current friends or relatives smoke . In fact , I do n't even smoke out in public anymore -- unless it 's dark and I 'm in my car . I feel it 's such a disgusting and stinky habit . '' Dulcie Long , 50 , of Denver , Colorado , said , `` I wo n't say I feel actual ` social discrimination , ' but it is something I feel a sense of shame about and do my best not to smoke in the presence of friends . None of my friends smoke , and I 'm very uncomfortable doing it anywhere near them . '' Even Dimmitt switched from a pipe to cigarettes when he was working with youngsters so he would n't reek so much . Not only have attitudes towards smoking changed , the profile of smokers has changed , too . `` The demographics have changed so much that now , more often than not , it 's the disadvantaged who are still smoking compared to the highly educated , highly trained people , '' Hurt said . `` It is pretty clear that the prevalence of smoking in groups of people is related to education status , which is a surrogate for income status . ... When you go down the income ladder , the smoking prevalence rises . Some groups of severely disadvantaged people have smoking rates of 30 to 40-plus percent . '' Hurt says that there is also a much higher prevalence of smoking among people with mental health disorders like depression , alcoholics , drug users and schizophrenics . But movers and shakers are not immune . President-elect Barack Obama has struggled with , and seems to have conquered , his habit . Former President Clinton was known to sit on the balcony of the White House and enjoy a cigar -LRB- his wife , Secretary of State-designate Hilary Clinton , officially made the White House a smoke-free zone -RRB- . First lady Laura Bush admits to being an ex-smoker . Plenty of celebrities -- like actresses Salma Hayek , Katherine Heigl and Eva Longoria Parker -- have been caught , cigarette in mouth , by the paparazzi . Even actor Patrick Swayze , who is battling pancreatic cancer , admitted that he continues to smoke . Which brings us back to the inescapable fact that , worldwide , an estimated 4 million adults die each year of tobacco-caused diseases . Said Hurt , `` This is only product that I know on the face of the Earth which , if it is used as recommended by manufacturer , kills 60 percent of its customers . ''

CLEARWATER , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of four missing boaters was found Monday clinging to an overturned fishing vessel off Florida 's Gulf Coast , and the search for the other three , including two NFL players , has narrowed , the Coast Guard said . Nick Schuyler clings to an overturned boat in this Coast Guard photo . `` We now know we are looking for persons in the water , not a boat , '' said Coast Guard Capt. Tim Close . Nick Schuyler , a former University of South Florida football player , was the only person still with the small fishing boat when a Coast Guard cutter came across it about 50 miles west of Clearwater Beach on Monday , the Coast Guard said . Still missing Monday afternoon were Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper ; NFL free agent Corey Smith , who played for the Detroit Lions for the past three seasons ; and former University of South Florida football player William Bleakley . Schuyler told his rescuers that the boat was anchored Saturday evening when it was overturned by waves during a storm , Close said . He told them that all four men were clinging to the boat for a time , but became separated , Close said . The four men embarked in a 21-foot single-engine boat from the Seminole Boat Ramp near Clearwater Pass about 6:30 a.m. Saturday , the Coast Guard said . The search was launched early Sunday after friends and relatives realized they had not returned from their fishing trip . Schuyler appeared to be conscious and talking in video showing him being removed from a Coast Guard helicopter Monday afternoon . Watch Schuyler being moved on stretcher '' Although he was initially able to answer a few questions to help with the search for the three missing men , officials decided to wait until he was treated for hypothermia before talking with him again , Coast Guard Petty Officer Robert Simpson said . See photos of rescue '' Schuyler 's parents , Marcia and Stu Schuyler , told reporters in Florida on Monday they were ecstatic that their son had been found alive . But Stu Schuyler said his `` heart is still out '' for the three missing men . `` We 're not going to talk too much until we find these guys . We 're all praying for them , '' Stu Schuyler said . The Air Force Reserve sent a C-130 airplane and a Pave Hawk helicopter to assist the Coast Guard 's search , which also included several other helicopters and airplanes . Three Coast Guard cutters were also on the water , Close said . Rough seas and high winds that hampered the search Sunday continued Monday . The Coast Guard reported winds of 15 to 20 knots and waves up to 9 feet in the search area Monday . `` It feels like my greatest fear coming true -- it does n't feel real , '' Cooper 's wife , Rebekah , told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa on Sunday . `` I 'm just waiting for a phone call . '' Watch relatives , friends express concern for missing boaters '' Cooper said she became worried Saturday night when she did n't hear from her husband . She called her husband 's fishing buddy , Brian Miller , who contacted the Coast Guard with the coordinates of where the men planned to fish . `` Usually I 'm on the boat . It 's a little difficult wondering if something would have been different if I had been there , '' Miller said . He said it was clear something was wrong when Cooper did n't call Saturday night . `` He should 've been within range to use his cell phone , and he knows enough to shut it off when he goes out so the batteries are still there , '' he said . Rebekah Cooper said her husband was aware of Sunday 's weather forecast and for that reason picked Saturday for the trip . `` Fishing is his first love , it always has been , '' she said , adding , `` I have a lot of faith in him out there . '' Cooper 's father said he learned of the situation Sunday morning from Rebekah . His son `` routinely stays out on the water 12 to 14 hours , '' Bruce Cooper , a sports anchor for CNN affiliate KPNX-TV in Phoenix , Arizona , said in a statement . He called his son an `` avid fisherman . '' `` He goes deep-sea fishing any opportunity he gets , '' Cooper said in the statement . `` Two years ago , I went deep-sea fishing with him . I swore I would never do so again ; I did n't like the fact that I could n't see land . Needless to say , I am very concerned . I am praying and hoping for the best . '' Smith and Cooper were teammates with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for part of the 2004 season , when Cooper was a rookie , according to the NFL 's Web site . Smith , who entered the league with Tampa Bay in 2002 , went on to play for the Washington Redskins before moving to the Lions for the 2006 season . Cooper has played for six teams in his five-season career . Cooper played college football at the University of Washington . Smith played at North Carolina State University . Bleakley lettered from 2004 to 2006 as a tight end for the University of South Florida , according to a spokesman for the university 's athletics department . Schuyler was a walk-on defensive end for the school in 2006 , but he never played in a game , the spokesman said . Schuyler 's father told reporters Sunday that the four men knew each other from working out at a gym , and that his son had accompanied Cooper and Smith on a fishing trip last week that lasted 15 hours .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For Sherrie Muldoon , the credit card debt was $ 46,244 . But the relief she felt after paying it off was priceless . So much so that the Colorado resident and her husband threw a party Saturday for friends and family after mailing off the final check . The event at a community center featured a cake decorated with the debt amount in green icing , CNN television affiliate KUSA reported . The couple had been paying the debt for three years and seven months , Muldoon told CNN , adding that the last payment they made recently was for $ 1,500 . `` When we mailed that last check ... I sat down in the car , I looked over to my husband and I just burst out into tears , '' she said . iReport.com : Have you paid off a huge debt lately ? The typical American household with at least one credit card has nearly $ 10,700 in credit card debt , according to CardWeb.com . The average interest rate runs in the mid - to high teens , according to the Web site . Muldoon said the soaring costs of their nine credit cards left them with two options : Either file for bankruptcy or make a drastic lifestyle change . They opted for the latter , she told KUSA . `` We changed everything ... to bare-bones minimum , '' Muldoon told CNN . `` Basically , if it was n't essential to support life , we did n't do it . '' The Muldoons are part of a national trend in easing off credit card use . Total consumer borrowing fell 3.5 percent in February , from the month before , according to the Federal Reserve . A government report shows the tumble in consumer credit was caused by a sharp decline in credit card use . The ailing economy and controlled spending caused by unemployment have contributed . Muldoon said she found a way to make money by doing extra jobs , including teaching fitness classes at night and cleaning office buildings on the weekends . Watch Muldoon describe how she whittled away at debt '' `` Dan says I 'm obsessed . I prefer the term ` focus-driven , ' '' Muldoon told KUSA . `` There were times last winter when dinner was white rice and gravy . That was what there was . We were n't starving to death , but I ca n't tell you the last time I had a steak . '' Muldoon said the quest to save money extended to the party , which she hosted using items that were either on sale or had been purchased with coupons . No steak was served there , either : She used ham from `` a couple of pigs '' she raised last year . Despite the merriment , she had one regret : She had paid full price for the black balloons that adorned the party room . `` I had some anguish over that , '' she said . `` But I moved past it fairly quickly . ''
Editor 's note : Deborah E. Lipstadt , Dorot professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory University , is the author of `` History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving . '' She was the target of a British libel lawsuit by Irving , a historian she said had become a spokesman for Holocaust denial . Lipstadt won the case in April 2000 . Read her blog here Deborah Lipstadt says the Holocaust love story seemed incredible on its face . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I do n't know whether to be sad or angry -- or both . The recent exposé of the fact that Herman Rosenblat 's Holocaust memoir is a hoax was no surprise to me . From the first time I heard the story of his `` miraculous '' survival during the Nazi era , I doubted that it could be true . Rosenblat 's claim that , as an inmate in a Buchenwald sub-camp , he had survived because a young girl had tossed an apple over the fence each day for seven months just did not seem credible to me . The notion that a concentration camp inmate could approach the fence without the SS shooting him beggared the imagination . I could not believe that a little girl whose family was supposedly passing as non-Jews would allow their daughter to engage in such an act . The fairy tale nature of the incident was enhanced by the supposed reunion of the couple on a blind date years later when both had moved to America . The story was that they discovered each other 's true identity and , after a whirlwind romance , decided to marry . Survivors who had been in the camp with Rosenblat and had kept in touch with him since the end of the war protested that the story could not be true . They wondered why Rosenblat had never mentioned the incident until the late 1990s . A number of other historians shared my doubts , which I posted on my blog . As one of the first to express skepticism about this , I became the target of attacks from those who thought I was demeaning the Rosenblats . We doubters could not , however , initially overcome the power of Oprah , on whose show Rosenblat and his wife appeared twice . Credulous reporters , who should have sought some form of verification , kept writing about this `` miraculous '' event . The producer who acquired movie rights tried to intimidate those of us who raised questions . He wrote to me saying , `` I have traveled all over Eastern Europe for several years in preparation for what will be a major feature film . I may be more of a Holocaust expert than you , even though , I have no title nor university affiliation . What I do know for sure is before I make any statements I know the facts . You simply do not know those facts , and that Deborah , is the greatest sin to the memory of all those perished so long ago . '' The publisher refused to let anyone see the book . Public relations people circulated versions of the story urging recipients to send it on so eventually it would reach millions of people . Slowly , thanks to the power of the Internet and the work of some intrepid historians , the hoax was exposed . The publisher pulled the book . The movie producer cried foul , presenting himself as a victim who had been duped . This is not the first time such a hoax has been perpetrated . Most of the previous stories have been spread by people who were passing as survivors . In contrast , the Rosenblats were both survivors of the Holocaust . But that fact has now been lost in the shuffle . What , then , is the danger of these sorts of hoaxes ? First of all , they give ammunition to Holocaust deniers . This is a bonanza for them . Deniers expend great efforts in trying to implant doubts in young people about the veracity of the Holocaust . They spend so much energy attacking `` Anne Frank : The Diary of a Young Girl '' because it is a book that is widely read by young people . The fact that this `` apples over the fence '' story has already been published as a widely successful children 's story provides the deniers with a great opportunity to peddle their wares . However , the danger posed by deniers is not the primary reason why such fabricated stories should be exposed . The events of the Holocaust are horrible in and of themselves . They do not need to be aggrandized or exaggerated to be made to sound any worse than they were . They also do not need to be rendered as joyful love stories that make us feel good about what happened . Both are insults to the survivors and inimical to the pursuit of historical truth . The optimum way of teaching about the Holocaust and presenting its history is , to quote Detective Joe Friday from the old TV show , `` Dragnet , '' `` just the facts , just the facts . '' What we need , particularly in relation to something as mind-boggling as the Holocaust , are `` just the facts . '' The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deborah Lipstadt .
LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nadya Suleman , who gave birth to octuplets in January , will tell her story in a book , although no publisher has been found to sell it , her lawyer said . In addition to her reality TV show , Nadya Suleman has met with a ghost writer for a book . Jeffrey Czech also confirmed details of a `` less-intrusive '' reality show about Suleman and her 14 kids , although no U.S. network has been signed to carry it . The advance money for the TV show deal will help Suleman pay her bills , Czech said . `` Obviously , she needs to do something more than just flip hamburgers all day , '' he said . Suleman was set to sign an agreement with a ghost writer for her book Monday , Czech said . While he would not name the writer , he said the two `` hit it off . '' In addition to the eight children born this year , Suleman has six other children . All 14 were conceived through in-vitro fertilization . The TV deal was signed with the British division of EyeWorks , Czech said . Headquartered in the Netherlands , EyeWorks produces and distributes television programs in Europe , parts of South America , Australia , New Zealand and the United States . Its U.S. productions include `` The Biggest Loser , '' which takes overweight participants through what producers call `` radical physical makeover without any kind of surgery . '' `` EyeWorks is a strong company and they did offer some money up front , which is obviously attractive to a woman with her financial situation , '' Czech said . He would not reveal terms of the TV deal or how much money was involved . The show would be similar to what EyeWorks has produced in Europe , in which a camera crew does not follow the family every day , he said . It would , instead , record milestones and special events . Suleman will handle the camera for much of the taping of her TV show , reducing the intrusion into her children 's lives by television crews , Czech said . Though he said the show has not been named , Suleman has sought to trademark her media nickname -- Octomom -- for a TV show and a line of diapers . Suleman has said no to some opportunities to make money , Czech said . She declined an offer from Vivid , a porn movie company , to star in its productions , he said .

SEOUL , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of protesters battled riot police in downtown Seoul early Sunday morning after a rally opposing South Korea 's decision to import U.S. beef turned violent . More than 100 were wounded , the state news agency reported . Police use a water cannon to disperse protesters during a rally against U.S. beef imports in Seoul on Sunday . Clashes broke out after more than 15,000 protesters headed toward the presidential office , news agency Yonhap said . The demonstrators used ropes to pull down police buses that had been parked around the presidential office to block the marchers from entering . Many carried steel pipes and hurled rocks at officers . Police fired back with water cannons and fire extinguishers . South Koreans have protested regularly since April when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the United States after a five-year ban . That ban was instituted over a case of mad cow disease in 2003 . Watch police and protesters battle in streets '' The widespread public protests essentially paralyzed the government of President Lee Myung-bak , who replaced seven top aides this month and plans to reshuffle his cabinet . After a series of negotiations , Seoul and Washington came up with a revised agreement on June 21 -- one that limits imports to cattle less than 30 months old . Animals more than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease , which can be transmitted to humans . The revised agreement also excludes the import of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease . The initial deal would have allowed the import of all U.S. beef imports . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , during a visit to visit to Seoul as part of an Asian tour , emphasized Saturday that American beef is safe and that her government will continue efforts to win consumer confidence . The assurance did little to placate demonstrators who took to the streets late Saturday night , leading to the latest riots . Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals . The U.S. banned recycled feeds in 1997 . Eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a rare and fatal malady in humans . Until the 2003 ban , South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters . The U.S. beef industry has lost up to $ 4 billion since the market closed , according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation . The imports are expected to resume this month .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two snowmobilers died Wednesday in an avalanche on Logan Peak north of Salt Lake City , Utah , a sheriff 's department official said . Two people died after being trapped on Utah 's Logan Peak during an avalanche . Lt. Matt Bilodeau of the Cache County Sheriff 's Office told CNN that someone using a satellite phone called at 10:30 a.m. -LRB- 12:30 p.m. ET -RRB- and told authorities about the incident . `` Two people were trapped , '' he said . `` They have both been recovered . '' The body of only one of them , a male , had been taken down the mountain , he said . Logan Peak 's summit is at an altitude of 9,710 feet . Though the area is not off limits to snowmobilers , they had been warned of the danger after a recent snowstorm . `` The media 's been putting that in the paper , on the radio and on TV , '' Bilodeau said . `` We are still in extreme avalanche danger , '' he said , and he urged snowmobilers to `` take into account they need to stay in probably the areas that have less of a slope to them . '' CNN 's Scott Spoerry , who grew up in the area , said a recent avalanche knocked out the water supply for the city of Logan 's 47,000 residents . `` Every year , there 's a few avalanches , '' he said . The area is also popular during the summer , when hang gliders launch themselves from the peak .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Violence and drug-trafficking have become such a major threat to Latin America that the presidents of Colombia , Mexico , Guatemala and Panama will sit around a table Friday in Panama to discuss what they can do about it . Cartridges and weapons seized from gangsters and drug-traffickers at the Military Headquarter in Mexico City . Their summit comes at a particularly troubled time for these governments , especially Mexico , which tallied a record number of drug-related killings last year . Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich characterized the battle in Mexico among drug cartels and with government authorities as a `` civil war '' on a news program this week . But Mexico is not alone . Colombia has been fighting drug cartels for decades . Panama has been a center of money-laundering for dug cartels and other organized crime groups for many years . And Guatemala has seen its share of slayings and bloodshed . `` It 's a recognition that there is a shared problem and that they ca n't solve that problem independent of each other , '' said Robert Pastor , a professor of international relations at American University in Washington who served as a national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s . Jennifer McCoy , the director of The Americas Program at the Carter Center in Atlanta , says it is `` encouraging '' that presidents Felipe Calderon of Mexico , Alvaro Uribe of Colombia , Alvaro Colom of Guatemala and Martin Torrijos of Panama not only recognize the problem but want to meet to see what they can do about it . `` The issue of security is vital in these countries and in Latin America , '' McCoy said . It 's not just a threat for Latin America , a recent report from the U.S. military says . The violence in Mexico and elsewhere south of the border could spill over to the United States , says the report , issued in November by the U.S. Joint Forces Command . `` The growing assault by the drug cartels and their thugs on the Mexican government over the past several years reminds one that an unstable Mexico could represent a homeland security problem of immense proportions to the United States , '' says the report , `` Joint Operating Environment 2008 . '' That instability could threaten the United States ' underbelly along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico . `` Any descent by Mexico into chaos would demand an American response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone , '' the report says . Mexican Secretary of Governance Fernando Gomez Mont rejected that notion in an interview with CNN this week , saying it is `` inadmissible '' that the United States would have to intervene . Pastor , who was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1994 to become U.S. ambassador to Panama , believes the United States should be more involved now . `` The United States is a major part of the problem , '' he said . `` The dollars are coming from the United States . The demand is coming from the United States . The arms are coming from the United States . '' Pastor pointed out that there are 7,600 gun shops in the United States within 100 miles of the Mexican border . `` We ought to have a clear recognition that that we are part of their problem , and they ca n't solve it without us , '' he said . Panamanian Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro indicated at a news conference this week that other nations also need to be more involved . He did n't mention the United States but it was clear whom he was talking about . The summit leaders will ask nations that have high drug consumption to do their part to reduce that demand , the Spanish news agency EFE quoted Lewis as saying . Mexican President Calderon met with President-elect Barack Obama in Washington this week and security was a prime subject of their discussions . `` Both countries share a long border , '' said Peter Hakim , president of the Inter-American Dialogue . `` They are terribly worried about the violence from organized crime in Mexico and slipover into the U.S. '' Hakim met with Calderon at a private dinner hosted by the Mexican president Sunday night . After his meeting with Obama on Monday , Calderon stressed the level to which the two nations are intertwined when it comes to security . `` The more secure Mexico is , the more secure the United States will be , '' the Mexican president said , first in Spanish and then in English , to make sure no one missed the point . Obama is likely receptive to that message , said Michael Shifter , a vice president at the Inter-American Dialogue . `` I think Obama is going to understand that Mexico is very important to the United States , '' Shifter told CNN last week . `` This is n't an issue that he has focused a lot of attention on up until now . But he 's going to understand that if Mexico really deteriorates or if the violence spills over into the border states , this is a war that he really has to deal with . '' Drug-fueled violence reached record levels in Mexico last year , with around 5,400 slayings , more than double the 2,477 reported in 2007 , Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said last month . The situation is so dire in Mexico that the Joint Forces Command report says , `` In terms of worst-case scenarios for the Joint Force and indeed the world , two large and important states bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse : Pakistan and Mexico . '' The report goes on to say that the `` Mexican possibility may seem less likely , but the government , its politicians , police , and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels . How that internal conflict turns out over the next several years will have a major impact on the stability of the Mexican state . ''
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Los Angeles police have launched an internal investigation to determine who leaked a picture that appears to show a bruised and battered Rihanna . Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend , singer Chris Brown , before the Grammys on February 8 . The close-up photo -- showing a woman with contusions on her forehead and below her eyes , and cuts on her lip -- was published on the entertainment Web site TMZ Thursday . TMZ said it was a photo of Rihanna . Twenty-one-year-old Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend , singer Chris Brown , on a Los Angeles street before the two were to perform at the Grammys on February 8 . `` The unauthorized release of a domestic violence photograph immediately generated an internal investigation , '' an L.A. police spokesman said in a statement . `` The Los Angeles Police Department takes seriously its duty to maintain the confidentiality of victims of domestic violence . A violation of this type is considered serious misconduct , with penalties up to and including termination . '' A spokeswoman for Rihanna declined to comment . The chief investigator in the case had told CNN earlier that authorities had tried to guard against leaks . Detective Deshon Andrews said he had kept the case file closely guarded and that no copies had been made of the original photos and documents . Brown was arrested on February 8 in connection with the case and and booked on suspicion of making criminal threats . Authorities are trying to determine whether Brown should face domestic violence-related charges . Brown apologized for the incident this week . `` Words can not begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired , '' the 19-year-old said in a statement released by his spokesman . `` I am seeking the counseling of my pastor , my mother and other loved ones and I am committed , with God 's help , to emerging a better person . '' CNN 's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report .
MUMBAI , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The children in their party outfits on the red carpet were in full agreement with the woman in the middle of the slum : `` It 's unbelievable ! '' Azharuddin Ismail and Rubina Ali got to leave their homes in Mumbai to go to Hollywood for the Oscars . Nine-year-old Rubina Ali and Azharuddin Ismail , 10 , were living a very different life and apparently loving every minute of it . The two , some of the child stars of the Oscar-winning `` Slumdog Millionaire '' movie , know the Indian slum well . It 's where they 've grown up , and it 's where they will return at the end of their Hollywood dream trip . But before that , there was the red carpet and an interview with E! host Ryan Seacrest , where they grinned and repeated their disbelief at what was happening to them . `` Unbelievable . I never thought it would be an Oscar , this movie , '' said another of the children , Ayush Mahesh Khedekar . Then it was to the awards show itself , where their movie won first for its cinematography , script and music . Toward the end of the evening , Danny Boyle picked up best director , and then Rubina , Azharuddin and many of the movie 's other stars got to storm the stage with producer Christian Colson to collect the best picture award . By that time , it was late morning in the children 's home city of Mumbai , where family , friends and many fellow residents of the slum watched the results from Hollywood . Watch how Mumbai celebrated '' `` I do n't really know what the Oscars are , '' Rubina 's mom said . `` I 'm just glad my daughter looks happy , though she told me she misses Indian food . '' The Oscar success of `` Slumdog '' distracted some from the drudgery of their daily lives . But the poverty and lack of opportunity that 's a central theme of the film is always all around . `` Our children lead a dog 's life , '' Rubina 's mother said , pointing out garbage everywhere , the open drains and the lack of education opportunities . That at least may change for Rubina and Azharuddin . In a few days they will be back in Mumbai and back in the slums that are their home . Watch how ` Slumdog Millionaire ' dominated at the Academy Awards '' But , according to media reports , Boyle has promised to help the children he plucked from the obscurity of the slum and see that they will now get to go to a proper school .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal immigration agents arrested about 300 workers Tuesday in a raid at a poultry processing plant in Greenville , South Carolina , the Department of Justice said . The agents executed a criminal search warrant at 9 a.m. at the Columbia Farms poultry processing plant , capping a 10-month investigation into the plant 's employment practices , said Barbara Gonzalez , a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement . About 58 of those arrested were allowed to return to their homes to take care of their children or for other humanitarian reasons , she said . The others were to be held in an ICE detention facility in the area . `` They are all illegals , '' Gonzalez said . `` We have charged them with being in violation of U.S. immigration laws . '' The investigation has already resulted in criminal charges being filed against 11 supervisors and a human resources manager , she said . Maria Juan , 22 , was one of about 50 relatives and friends of workers who huddled at the edge of the plant after the raid , some weeping and others talking frantically on cell phones , The Associated Press reported . She was seeking information about her 68-year-old grandmother , a legal immigrant from Guatemala who went to work without identification papers but was later released , the AP reported . `` Families are going to be broken apart , '' Juan told the AP . `` There will be kids and babies left behind . Why are they doing this ? Why ? They did n't do anything . They only wanted to work . '' No one from Columbia Farms or from its parent company , House of Raeford Farms in Raeford , North Carolina , responded immediately to telephone messages . The Charlotte Observer newspaper first reported in February that plant workers were in the country illegally and company managers knew it , the AP reported . The raid `` is a drop in the bucket '' that is unlikely to persuade anyone in the United States illegally to go home , said Dan Kowalski , an Austin , Texas-based lawyer specializing in immigration law . He questioned the conclusion by Gonzalez and ICE that all of those arrested are indeed illegal immigrants . `` A judge has to say that , they ca n't just say that , '' he said .
-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Your mission , if you choose to accept it , is to seek out covert items at fast food chains around the country . Be warned , this mission includes very real dangers such as hardening arteries and skyrocketing cholesterol . We 've compiled a list to get you started . 1 . If you 're at Starbucks and in need of just a little caffeine , do n't worry -- there 's a tiny option for you . It 's the Short size , and they do n't advertise it . It 's like a little baby cup of coffee . It also comes in handy when you 're scrounging for change and do n't have enough for a tall -LRB- not that that has ever happened to me -RRB- . 2 . It 's a good thing we do n't have Jamba Juice here in Iowa , because I would be all over candy-based smoothies . Because it 's considered a health-food chain , Jamba Juice does n't officially list these on their in-store menus , but the Web site Mighty Foods assures us that the secret flavors exist . The ones they confirmed with the company 's headquarters include Strawberry Shortcake , White Gummy Bear , PB&J , Various flavors of Starbursts , Fruity Pebbles , Push-Up Pops , and Skittles . Other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist : Chocolate Gummi Bear , Apple Pie , Sourpatch Kid , Tootsie Roll , and Now and Later . 3 . This one might be my favorite . At Fatburger , you can order a Hypocrite -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon . 4 . Chipotle has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available , they will make it for you . Things that have been tested include nachos , quesadillas , taco salads and single tacos . Some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item , however , so maybe someday soon you wo n't need a super-secret handshake to order one .

But in case you 're not in the habit of surfing fast food Web sites , here 's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items : ordering something `` Animal Style '' at In-N-Out means you 're going to get it with lettuce , tomato , a mustard-cooked beef patty , pickles , extra spread -LRB- it 's sort of Thousand-Islandy -RRB- and grilled onions . You can even get your fries Animal Style . Mental Floss : Why is it called `` Thousand Island '' dressing ? `` Protein Style '' is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun .

WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A process that started months ago among White House lawyers to compile a list of possible Supreme Court picks has accelerated with word Justice David Souter plans to step down from the bench in June . Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the only female high court justice . Women likely will be high on the Souter successor list . The nominee would give President Obama an immediate opportunity to place his stamp on the nation 's highest court , and perhaps to begin cementing his legacy with a lifetime appointment to that bench . Obama on Friday said he will seek `` somebody with a sharp , independent mind and a record of excellence and integrity . '' That person must honor traditions , respect the judicial process and share Obama 's grasp of constitutional values , he said . The president said he intends to consult with people in both political parties as he makes his choice to replace Souter . Legal sources say Obama 's legal team will begin refocusing what had been an aggressive effort to fill federal vacancies on lower federal court seats . Now their attention will be directed into a search for Souter 's replacement . Administration officials have been working closely with key senators and Democratic legal advisers on possible choices . `` The -LSB- Obama -RSB- White House and the Justice Department certainly have people there already thinking about the issues , compiling lists , starting to vet the backgrounds of those candidates , '' said Edward Lazarus , a Supreme Court legal expert and a legal adviser during the Obama transition . A mix of federal judges and political allies are among the names the administration is said to be informally considering , said legal and political sources . Among them are federal appeals court judges Sonia Sotomayor , 55 , of New York ; Diane Wood , 59 , of Chicago ; and Solicitor General Elena Kagan . Those sources say women candidates will be at or near the top of the list of finalists . `` The president has long recognized the need for more gender diversity on the high court , '' said one source who asked not to be identified . Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , 76 , is the only woman on the high court . Sotomayor is near the top of the list of many sources consulted by CNN . She is a Hispanic-American named a federal trial judge by President Bush in 1992 and elevated to her seat in 1996 . Her supporters call her a moderate who would enjoy bipartisan support in the Senate . But conservative legal blogs in recent weeks have been sharply questioning her judicial philosophy , perhaps anticipating a high court vacancy . Fights over judicial nominees have grown increasingly partisan and nasty in recent years , sparked by the confirmation fights over Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court . Bork was rejected by lawmakers , while Thomas sits on the high court . Many of President George W. Bush 's judicial choices were blocked by Democratic senators , and his two Supreme Court picks were the subject of massive ad campaigns launched by advocacy groups on both sides of the political debate . Conservatives have vowed to give Obama the same treatment over his choices . Most of Bush 's lower court choices were not named until August 2001 , seven months into his first term . The political and practical stakes are high . Sources have said privately the president is not interested in choosing `` extreme '' liberals to the bench , an idea echoed by some legal analysts . Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider examine Obama 's options '' `` I do n't expect to see President Obama naming some real firebrands , the kind that might be real lightning-rods for controversial confirmation hearings , '' said Lazarus . Conservatives `` are assuming that in his heart of hearts , Obama is an activist , old-fashioned , liberal firebrand on judicial issues , and , at least if one goes by what President Obama has written on the subject , he 's not . '' Obama , a Harvard Law School graduate , has taught constitutional law in Chicago . Republicans have warned the White House not to shut them out of the overall judicial selection process . In a March 2 letter , 41 GOP senators urged Obama `` to consult with us as it considers possible nominations to the federal courts from our states . '' If not consulted , they said , `` The Republican Conference will be unable to support moving forward on that nominee . '' Watch CNN 's Dana Bash report on how Republicans might respond '' Translation , say liberal groups : filibusters and obstructionist tactics . `` Republican senators fought hard against some of President Clinton 's candidates , '' said Nan Aron , who heads the the Alliance for Justice . `` I think we saw it during Eric Holder 's hearing -LSB- for attorney general -RSB- . Republican senators were testing out messages , not designed to deny confirmation to Eric Holder but to test them to see whether those tactics would work with some of Obama 's judicial nominees , '' Aron said . `` That 's going to happen . There 's no question about it . '' The fight over Souter 's seat could be just the opening act to perhaps two more high court vacancies under Obama . Bush burnished his conservative credentials by naming Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the high court , and helped increase the overall conservative bent of most federal courts . Republicans have controlled the White House -- and thereby court nominations -- in 28 of the last 40 years . Seven of the nine high court members were named by GOP presidents . Obama has said Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- liberals named by President Clinton -- are his kind of judges , but Obama has spoken only in general terms about the type of person he would nominate . `` I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record , who have the intellect , and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through , '' he said at the October 15 presidential debate .
LUKAVAC , Bosnia-Herzegovina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man 's remains lie on a table . Next to him are the bones of his 22-year-old son and the remains of another son . But no one yet knows which of the man 's two missing boys the third set of remains could be . Cheryl Katzmarzyk measures a leg bone as she puts together remains from Srebrenica . Cheryl Katzmarzyk wants to be able to put a name to the remains , and to those of hundreds of other bodies stacked around her in a building in Lukavac , near Tuzla in the northeast of Bosnia . The bones are from more than 8,000 men and boys slaughtered in 1995 during the Bosnian war at Srebrenica in the worst massacre in Europe since World War II . The killers -- Serbs seeking to drive out Bosnian Muslims in a policy of `` ethnic cleansing '' -- executed the region 's fighting-age males , then used bulldozers to dump them into mass graves . What makes the work harder for the teams trying to put the bodies back together -- so they can be returned to their families for proper burial -- is that so many have been broken up over the years . Mass graves were dug up and the bodies moved sometimes again and again , to hide evidence as the Serbs retreated amid the NATO bombing that followed Srebrenica and led to the end of the war . Those killed in a warehouse execution at Srebrenica are spread throughout 20 secondary grave sites , for instance . Katzmarzyk said remains of one of the victims was found in eight different parts of one mass grave . Another man 's shoulder was found where he and others were lined up and shot , one of his legs was found near a grave , a hip was found inside the grave , his upper jaw several miles away and his left arm in a secondary grave . `` What we do here is we sort them out , '' said Katzmarzyk , the head of anthropological examinations for the International Commission on Missing Persons . Katzmarzyk 's team from the ICMP -- a nongovernmental organization set up at the end of the Bosnian war to locate and identify victims of war and human rights abuses -- has pioneered quicker , simpler DNA tests to work out which bones go together . Watch an audio slideshow about the ICMP 's work '' Then , a more extensive DNA test is done to see if there is a match with any of thousands of relatives who have donated their own samples in the hope of finding missing relatives . But DNA can only go so far , and while it can show that the unidentified remains on Katzmarzyk 's table are those of a man and his 22-year-old son , it can not say whether the third set belongs to a missing 21-year-old or his 24-year-old brother -- because neither had children to act as an extra reference point . It 's a particular problem with identifying the Srebrenica dead because so many of the victims were related . Across the room , brothers lie next to each other , but as yet the scientists do not know who is who . So Katzmarzyk and her colleagues are also experts in forensic anthropology , using other pointers to make an identification . They will look for clues to the age of the remains and any other factors that could identify them : Did the man break his leg as a child ? What clothes was he wearing ? How tall was he ? `` We started to look at clothing , place of disappearance , '' said Katzmarzyk . `` We use all kinds of evidence to identify as many people as possible . '' Watch a Bosnia concentration camp survivor describe the torture and rape she witnessed '' About 5,200 people out of the 8,000 executed at Srebrenica have been identified with the help of ICMP , but new mass graves continue to be found and more remains are delivered to the facility in Lukavac to be matched . Years of work lie ahead -- if governments continue to contribute to the project . `` We still have many more IDs to make , but what we need are additional funds to ensure that the process is completed . It 's essential . ... This is a unique contribution to the investigation of genocide , '' said Katzmarzyk , who was recently working on 842 sets of remains , all but one of them male . Evidence gathered by the ICMP about the Srebrenica genocide could also be used against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , who is set to face trial at The Hague , accused of ordering the massacre . ICMP helped identify victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Asian tsunami , but its main work continues in the former Yugoslavia , where the condition of the remains makes it vital to use DNA , forensic anthropology and anything else to piece skeletons together and give them a name . `` The ICMP is unique in that all these lines of inquiry are used together , '' Katzmarzyk said . `` DNA is essential , anthropology is essential . '' The work is challenging scientifically and sometimes emotionally , she said . It is rewarding and satisfying to identify remains and allow them to be released to the coroner and then to the family . But some cases are more haunting . `` The fact that I have three brothers lying side by side on a table -- how can that not affect you ? '' Katzmarzyk asked . `` And there 's a fourth brother missing . ''

WATERLOO , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A southwestern Illinois man accused of strangling his wife and two young sons did not ask how his family was killed or see their bodies after he learned of the deaths , a police official said at a preliminary hearing Wednesday . Christopher Coleman has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bond . Christopher Coleman , 32 , is charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Garett , 11 , Gavin , 9 , and his wife , Sheri Coleman , 31 . The victims were strangled in their beds last month . A pathologist will testify during the trial that the time of deaths May 5 was between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. , hours before Coleman said he drove to a gym , said Chief Joe Edwards of the Columbia Police Department . Coleman , a security supervisor , was arrested May 19 . The chief also said that a handwriting expert has concluded that the profanity-laced messages scrawled in red spray paint throughout the house match Coleman 's handwriting . Spray-painted messages were also found on Gavin 's bed sheets , he said . Watch more on the profane messages '' Threatening letters left in the family 's mailbox and an e-mail allegedly sent to Coleman before the killings were traced back to the suspect 's laptop , he said . The letters had no envelopes and no postage , according to Edwards . Testifying at a hearing at the Monroe County Courthouse , the chief said that a police chaplain noticed an abrasion on Coleman 's right arm as he was escorted to an ambulance after the bodies were discovered . Coleman then repeatedly punched the gurney with the arm , Edwards said , adding that when the suspect 's father asked him about the abrasion , he said it was from punching the gurney . The suspect was having an affair with a friend of his wife who lives in Florida , according to prosecutors . Computer forensics found videos , photos and messages between the two , Edwards said . Coleman pleaded not guilty to all charges . The next court date is set for August 26 .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Baltimore , Maryland , police officers were shot Saturday after a gunman 's domestic dispute led to shootings at two locations , a police spokesman told CNN . Crime scene tape cordons off a squad car involved in a chase and shootings Saturday in Baltimore . The rampage began at the home of the suspect 's ex-girlfriend , who has a restraining order against him , police spokesman Don Moses said . The suspect , 34 , forced his way into her home and they argued , Moses said . In an apparent rage , the man fired a round from a 9 mm Ruger , Moses said . The ex-girlfriend called police about 10:30 a.m. Moses described to CNN what unfolded next . Police have not released the names of anyone involved . Police received a call from the suspect 's current girlfriend just before 11 a.m. . She told them the suspect came to her home and assaulted her , and she suffered minor injuries . While a 42-year-old policeman was at her home tending to her report , the suspect called her . The officer talked to the suspect on the phone and convinced him to return to west Baltimore , where the girlfriend lived . When the suspect pulled up in a car , the officer approached him and was fired upon , suffering a gunshot wound to the buttocks . The wounded officer got into his patrol car and chased the suspect . An officer providing backup at the first shooting scene spotted the suspect 's vehicle parked three blocks away . As the policeman observed the vehicle from inside his patrol car , the suspect appeared on the driver 's side and fired at the officer . The backup officer , 44 , who was wearing a bullet-proof vest , was shot in the chest and arm but managed to return fire , hitting the suspect three times . He was in stable condition after surgery and was expected to survive . The suspect is in custody and expected to live , Moses said . The officer shot in the buttocks was treated and released from the hospital Saturday .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Environmental saviors can turn up in the most unexpected places . For the answer to our global waste management crisis , we need only look as far as our back gardens , for example . Forty million manure worms are being put to use in Sydney to treat its sewage . That 's what proponents of vermicomposting will tell us , anyway . Vermicomposting is the art of composting using worms -- and it is worms , apparently , who could save us yet . Worms are nature 's waste disposal units . Or rather , it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units , as they do n't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful : nutrient-rich compost . Earthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly , in this context : The Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus , which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting , according to CityFarmer.org . Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day , but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process , according to The Ecologist . There are a lot of them , too . You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land , according to NatureWatch , their population doubling in size every one-two months . And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves , stems and dead roots in one year , ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process . What they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients . According to NatureWatch , earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen , seven times as much phosphorous , 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more `` beneficial bacteria '' than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place . Literally speaking , what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out . Utilizing ` black gold ' It is no surprise why these worms ' byproducts are often referred to as `` black gold , '' this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world 's agricultural soil has become `` seriously degraded , '' according to the UK Soil Association . Worm compost : Just one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days , according to ScienceDaily . And plants love it . Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting , by as much as 40 percent for broccoli , 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots , according to The Ecologist . According to the World Waste Survey , compiled by Veolia Environmental Services , we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004 . And a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted . Around 32 percent of the European Union 's annual municipal waste -LRB- around 120 million tons -RRB- is food and garden waste , according to Waste Management World . And 30 percent of U.S. waste could have been composted in 2000 , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill , emitting methane into the atmosphere . As local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste , vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places . In Hong Kong , none other than fast-food chain McDonald 's has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day , according to the Reuters news service . McDonald 's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to Hong Kong 's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent , Reuters reports . Other companies to have experimented with worm composting include Ikea in the U.S. state of Illinois , where , according to Treehugger.com , it is conducting vermicomposting trials . If all goes well , it aims to use worm composting to boost its 70 percent recycling rates to 90 percent , the site says . As it happens , we have had this knowledge for centuries . Aristotle himself was even said to have called worms the `` intestines of the soil , '' according to The New York Times , which also points out that Cleopatra was another devotee , bestowing sacred status on them and ordering them protected . Charles Darwin admired their land-tilling abilities so much that he wrote a book on them . `` It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures , '' he mused , according to The New York Times . Greenhouse gas emitters What Darwin , Cleopatra or Aristotle could not have known however , is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste . Scientists in India have found that worms ' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic-free manure . According to the Indian newspaper , India Together , researchers in Gujarat have found that worms can `` detox '' the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste . The method is ideal for industries -- such as paper , food processing , oil , textiles , dairy , distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge , Indian researchers say . But even with vermicomposting , something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around , there 's a downside -- and it 's a rather large one . It turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide . Unfortunately , in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , large-scale composting plants could be just as damaging to the environment as landfills of the same size , reports the UK 's Telegraph newspaper . `` The emissions that come from these worms can actually be 290 times more potent than carbon dioxide and 20 times more potent than methane , '' the Telegraph quotes Jim Frederickson , an Open University research fellow . `` In all environmental systems you get good points and bad points .

MADRID , Spain -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For five years , the horrible memory has lingered in the minds of Madrid 's commuters , quietly riding their trains into the heart of the city . The pain is easing , but it 's a nagging ache just the same . The rush-hour train bombings killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others . It was March 11 , 2004 , during morning rush hour , that terrorists armed with powerful bombs boarded these same commuter train lines , unleashing an onslaught that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others . The attacks are the deadliest in Europe since the rise of al Qaeda . More than a year later on July 7 , 2005 , terrorists would stage bombings on the London transit system that killed 52 people and wounded hundreds more . The explosives were left on the Spanish trains in sports bags and backpacks -- sometimes placed under seats -- court documents say . The terrorists got off at various stations down the line , before cell-phone timers detonated 10 bombs in quick succession on four trains at three stations . Police dismantled another bomb that did n't explode . It provided vital clues that led to arrests . Eighteen people , mostly Islamic militants , have been convicted in the attacks . Watch more on the anniversary Juan Carlos Garcia , an engineer who took the train later that same day , said he knows a couple whose daughter died in the attacks . `` It was very tough , especially knowing it could have been you , '' Garcia said . `` Now , you remember it , but not the same as when it just happened . '' Beata Sadecka , a regular commuter , says she rides cautiously . `` Every day , when I get on the train , I always ride in the last car , '' Sadecka said . `` I do n't know why , for safety , '' she added , not quite sure of her motives . On one train , the first explosion was in a rear car and , as people ran forward to get away , they were hit by explosions in the middle cars , investigators have said . `` People remember the March 11th attacks , '' said Vicente Jimenez , a deputy editor with El Pais newspaper , `` and while conscious that the threat continues , you have to continue with your life . '' Memorial observations were scheduled throughout the day , including five minutes of silence for the victims . King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero were not taking part in the public events . A victims group called their non-participation a slight . But on this fifth anniversary , most commuters are just going about their business , with that nagging ache still lingering .
-LRB- Entertainment Weekly -RRB- -- `` Amelia '' is a frustratingly old-school , Hollywood-style , inspirational biopic about Amelia Earhart that does n't trust a viewer 's independent assessment of the famous woman pictured on the screen . Hilary Swank plays Amelia Earhart and Richard Gere plays husband George Putnam in `` Amelia . '' The mystery we ought to be paying attention to is : What really happened on the legendary American aviator 's final , fatal flight in 1937 ? But the question audiences are left with is this : How could so tradition-busting a role model have resulted in so square , stiff , and earthbound a movie ? Why present such a modern woman in such a fusty format ? Dressed for the title role in a wardrobe of jumpsuits , leather jackets , scarves , and slinky evening wear dashing enough to stop air traffic , Hilary Swank 's Earhart does n't so much talk as make stump speeches -- even when she 's at her own breakfast table . And director Mira Nair -LRB- `` The Namesake '' -RRB- , working from an overexplanatory script by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan -LRB- based on dual biographies by Susan Butler and Mary S. Lovell -RRB- , overloads the picture with a cargo of messages , so much so that she deadens her subject 's spirit . Some of these talking points are aimed at today 's teenage girls who might admire the subject 's highly personal fashion sense ; others go out to older women who cherish her feminist cred . All of them add up to banners that might as well be flown from an aircraft tail over a beach : Amelia Earhart lived free in life and love ! And Fly ! She ! Must ! Of course , she did , setting records as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic in 1928 -LRB- she was a passenger , but still , ladies of the day generally did n't wear leather helmets and zoom through the air -RRB- . Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932 . She went on to launch her own brand-name fashion line . In 1935 , she became the first pilot to fly solo from Hawaii to California . Sometimes the press dubbed her Lady Lindy , linking her fame to that of pioneering pilot Charles Lindbergh . Most famously , she vanished -LRB- along with her navigator , Fred Noonan -RRB- in the middle of the Pacific while on an around-the-world flight in 1937 ; her plane was never found , and she was declared legally dead in 1939 . Along the way , the celebrity married George Putnam , the publisher and tireless promoter who shaped her public image . -LRB- Richard Gere does the honors as Putnam with all the dated , silver-head-in-hands poses required of him as a worried businessman/spouse whose wife is also his client . -RRB- For a time , the freethinking woman also conducted a love affair with aeronautics pioneer Gene Vidal -LRB- Ewan McGregor -RRB- , now best known as the father of writer Gore Vidal . Swank delivers long , carefully composed explications of Earhart 's unorthodox attitude toward marriage and feminine autonomy , taken from her journal entries , in studied accents somewhere between those of the Kansas plains of Earhart 's birth and those of Katharine Hepburn in her most famous trouser-wearing , gumption-gal roles . iReport.com : Share your movie reviews `` Amelia '' dutifully conveys the salient biographical info with a trusty cinematic device : As Earhart and Noonan embark on their doomed flight , flashbacks catch the audience up on the events that got her there . -LRB- Christopher Eccleston , as Noonan , is the one understated player in this endeavor . -RRB- Those last 10 minutes or so of radio-communications loss , concurrent instrument failure , and dawning awareness of disaster are honestly gripping . But just in case the point is n't clear enough -LRB- She ! Must ! Fly ! -RRB- , throughout the drama composer Gabriel Yared lays on blasts of musical exclamations that are as distracting as sirens . Sometimes that music says , `` It 's great to be in the sky and surfing the clouds ! '' Sometimes it says , `` Look how pretty the landscape looks below -- kind of makes you miss the music in ` Out of Africa , ' right ? '' Sometimes the rumble of violins and horns hints , `` Uh-oh , we 're getting to the tragic part of the story ! '' Mostly , the busy orchestra backs up the starry cinematography to remind us , `` This slim , androgynous beauty , with her unusual love life and her driving need to take to the skies , sure was something , huh ?! '' Whatever the message , there 's no navigating around such intrusive messengers . EW Grade : C + CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Americans do n't usually pay a lot of attention to Spanish politics , but the election of 2004 proved an exception . The election that occurred Sunday should be a second . The election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the Iraq war . Sunday 's election could be seen as a referendum on the euro-elites who so strongly opposed that war . The conservatives who governed Spain in 2004 had strongly aligned themselves with the United States after the 9/11 attacks . In 2003-2004 , Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar gained the limelight -- and endured abuse -- as George Bush 's most prominent ally on the European continent . Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts . Aznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004 , in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand : a bombing of Madrid 's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 . Aznar 's replacement , Jose Luis Zapatero , ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States . He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens . He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel . Yet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues , Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain 's gathering economic challenges . Indeed for a long time , Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all . I made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years . The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism . For centuries , Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically . Now at last the economy was surging . In the early 2000s , average living standards caught up to those of Italy ; if Spain -LRB- they said -RRB- continued to grow at current rates , it would catch up to France within the decade . Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005 . How ? Now we come to the fine print . If you looked closely , the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy . Spain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s . The currency launched in 2002 . Signing up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain . The German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy . One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate . The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option . Instead , the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain . Result : Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008 , the Spanish trade deficit tripled , from 3 % of GDP in 2002 to more than 10 % in 2008 . You might wonder : wait a minute ! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain , then logically the price of Spanish goods and services -LRB- including vacations -RRB- must have risen to Germans . So how did Spain finance its German buying boom ? Answer : The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany . The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China 's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship . Between 2002 and 2008 , Spanish households went on a borrowing binge . They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes . Through the 2000s , Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain , Germany and France combined . Spain built shopping malls and office buildings to match . By 2008 , construction accounted for a staggering 16 % of the Spanish economy . And all of it was financed by debt : Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90 % of GDP -LRB- only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble -RRB- , and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205 % of GDP -LRB- vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed -RRB- . Americans well-understand how this game ends . One day , the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise . The bubble pops . Asset values tumble . The debts remain . As debtors scramble to service their debts , they cut back their buying of goods and services . That causes a recession , which causes asset values to tumble more , which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds . Spain now faces nearly 22 % unemployment -- Great Depression levels -- and staggering government deficits . The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro , but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts . Zapatero slunk out of town a little while ago . Good riddance to the man who boorishly insulted the American flag at the Spanish National Day parade in 2003 to score a point with the left wing of his political party . Spain 's conservatives scored a crushing victory in the Sunday vote , as the Spanish people try any desperate measure to restore their lost prosperity . But it will take more than an election to do the job . It will take a grand rethink of the whole euro currency project , a rethink that either emancipates Spain to quit the euro and export enough to repay its debts or else reduces the debt enough that Spain can sustain its expensive new currency . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former University of Georgia professor , wanted in the fatal shootings of his wife and two other people over the weekend , purchased a plane ticket to the Netherlands for May 2 , authorities said Monday . An alert on the UGA Web site says professor George Zinkhan is a suspect in an off-campus shooting . A nationwide manhunt for George Zinkhan , 57 , extended into a third day with no sign of him , authorities said . Zinkhan was a marketing professor at the university 's Terry College of Business , but was terminated on Sunday , the day after the shootings , university officials said . Zinkhan had previously purchased the plane ticket to the Netherlands , said Gregory Jones , special agent in charge for the FBI 's Atlanta , Georgia , office . Authorities say Zinkhan owns a home in Amsterdam , Netherlands . The FBI is working with its agents overseas and police in the Netherlands , Jones said . A nationwide alert for Zinkhan has been issued by Athens-Clarke County police . The shootings took place at a community theater group 's reunion Saturday in Athens , Georgia , just off campus . Police Capt. Clarence Holeman identified the victims as Marie Bruce , 47 , Zinkhan 's wife and a prominent Athens attorney ; Tom Tanner , 40 ; and Ben Teague , 63 . The university terminated Zinkhan on Sunday , President Michael Adams told reporters on Monday . Police said Zinkhan has relatives in Texas and owns a home in Amsterdam , Netherlands . He was last seen driving a red , 2005 Jeep Liberty after the shootings Saturday . Authorities do not believe Zinkhan is still on campus or in the city of Athens , University Police Chief Jimmy Williams said Monday . As a precaution , he added , security has been beefed up on campus , including officers on foot patrols carrying semiautomatic weapons . The victims were all associated with the Town and Gown Players , a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings . `` The three people we lost -LRB- Saturday -RRB- were a part of the rich 50-year history of this theater and , more than that , were vital members of the Town and Gown family , '' the organization said Sunday on its Web site . The site described Bruce as `` the binding force that held the Town and Gown community together . '' `` Having worked with Town and Gown for over 20 years , at one time or another she served in every capacity at the theater , artistically and administratively , from leading lady to president of the board to chief cook and bottle washer . '' Holeman said Saturday , `` It appeared -LRB- Zinkhan -RRB- and his wife -LRB- Bruce -RRB- were having problems . '' Meanwhile , the university said that classes would be held Monday , as the school term enters its final week . In a letter `` to the members of the University of Georgia community '' posted on the school 's Web site , Adams said operations would continue uninterrupted . But , `` I urge everyone to continue to exercise caution until the suspect is apprehended , '' Adams said . Adams ' letter said counseling would be available to any member of the faculty or staff and to students . The university 's annual end-of-year campus memorial service , in which those lost over the past year are remembered , is scheduled for Tuesday night , Adams said . Victims of Saturday 's shooting will be honored at that service . Police said Zinkhan was not at the Town and Gown event originally but arrived and , according to Holeman of the Athens police , got into `` a disagreement '' with his wife . He left the scene , and police believe he went to his car , where the couple 's children apparently were waiting , and returned with two handguns . The shootings `` only took a few minutes , '' Holeman said . Police found eight shell casings . After the shooting , Zinkhan left the scene with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle , police said . He drove to a neighbor 's home in nearby Bogart , Georgia , where he lived and left the children there . The neighbor , Bob Covington , told CNN that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon with the two children . `` He rang the doorbell , asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour , '' Covington said . `` I said sure , and he said there 'd been some type of emergency , and he took off . '' Zinkhan seemed hurried and agitated but that seemed consistent with an emergency , Covington said . He did n't question Zinkhan about the emergency , Covington said , adding that it was n't unusual for someone in his family to watch the children . An hour or so later , he said , police arrived and took the children . Police searched Zinkhan 's home on Saturday , but there was no indication of what evidence they might have gathered there . University police were assisting Athens-Clarke County police in their investigation , officials said Monday . The university activated its alert system following the shooting with a description of the suspect , said spokesman Tom Jackson . Statistics show the university was able to reach 82 percent of the 64,000 people it attempted to contact , he said , adding that some of the calls went to university offices unstaffed on weekends . An alert was also posted on the school 's Web site , and an all-campus e-mail was sent Saturday night . Adams said the university 's provost and deans would determine how to handle the remainder of classes and exams for the classes -- one graduate and one undergraduate -- taught by Zinkhan .
MANAGUA , Nicaragua -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nicaragua 's election council will allow a review of the mayoral election in the nation 's capital after opponents of the ruling Sandinista Party raised fraud allegations , the council 's president said Wednesday . Opponents of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega 's Sandinista party have raised election fraud allegations . Election council President Robert Rivas announced that ballot tally sheets from Managua would be reviewed after violence followed a resounding victory for the Sandinistas in Sunday 's municipal elections . The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front won mayoral races in 94 municipalities , while the main opposition party , the Liberal Constitutional Party -LRB- PLC -RRB- , captured 46 posts and minor parties won six , according to results provided by the government . The PLC and other groups rejected the results and called for an international investigation . The Organization of American States met with opposition leaders Wednesday . Jose Pallais , a PLC leader , asked for the annulment of the elections . The Supreme Electoral Council is to verify final results by November 23 , but a tally is possible by next week . `` Everyone is waiting for the final numbers , '' journalist Rosemary Thornton said . `` Once they do , there might be violence again . '' Election critics cite many irregularities for their allegations , including the government 's refusal to allow foreign and local monitors , the delay in tabulating ballots and discrepancies between results certified by election officials and the tallies released on television . In addition , ballots were found in trash dumps in the municipalities of Tipitapa , which is part of Managua , and Leon . La Prensa newspaper published 40 photographs on its Web site that appear to show discarded ballots and other election material at an unnamed dump . Ethics and Transparency , a Nicaraguan observer group that was not sanctioned by the government , has reported discrepancies in about one-third of the polls it monitored . The group said it had 30,000 volunteers nationwide monitoring the election . The monitoring group said the results in more than 100 of the 146 elections were correct , a local newspaper reported . But the results in another 30 municipalities require further investigation into possible irregularities , La Prensa newspaper said on its Web site , citing Ethics and Transparency executive director Roberto Courtney . The Catholic Church asked the electoral council for a recount . The Sandinista government is led by President Daniel Ortega , a leader in the guerrilla movement that ousted Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza in July 1979 . Ortega served as president from 1985-90 . After three unsuccessful bids , he won the presidency again in 2006 . Sunday 's elections were the first since he regained the presidency .
WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of a shipping company recently victimized by pirates off the Somali coast told lawmakers Tuesday that U.S. cargo crews should be allowed to arm themselves in response to the rising hijacking threat . In April , pirates attacked The Liberty Sun , a U.S.-flagged cargo ship , but were unable to board . Philip Shapiro , head of Liberty Maritime Corp. , told a U.S. Senate Commerce subcommittee that the owners of U.S.-flagged `` have done all they can within the law to protect our crews . '' Unfortunately , he said , U.S. vessels are still largely at the mercy of pirates in shipping lanes around the heavily trafficked Gulf of Aden . `` In light of the recent threats to U.S. merchant mariners , we respectfully request that Congress consider clearing the obstacles that currently block ship owners from arming our vessels , '' Shapiro said . Pirates unsuccessfully attempted to board the Liberty Sun , a cargo vessel owned by Shapiro 's company , near the Somali coast on April 14 . The ship was on a humanitarian relief mission at the time , carrying 47,000 tons of food to Mombassa , Kenya . Pirate leaders later said the attempted hijacking was carried out as revenge after the U.S. Navy killed three pirates involved in a failed attack on the cargo ship Maersk Alabama . The slain pirates were holding Capt. Richard Phillips , who was in charge of the Alabama when it was boarded April 8 . `` We 've heard some suggestions that U.S.-flagged ship owners have not done enough to protect their vessels , '' Shapiro said . `` That view ... is flat wrong . Our company adopted every measure recommended by the international maritime organizations and required by the Coast Guard 's approved security plan for making the vessel a difficult piracy target -- and more . '' Merchant vessels do n't usually carry firearms , he said , but the `` Maersk Alabama incident constitutes a game changer . ... Self-proclaimed pirate leaders have now issued direct threats of violence against American merchant mariners . '' Shapiro said that U.S. crews have a right to self-defense under U.S. laws dating back to 1819 , but `` recently enacted State Department arms export regulations effectively prohibit the arming of vessels . '' He also said that ship owners are at risk of `` being second-guessed in U.S. and foreign courts for self-defensive measures that were common in 1819 . '' Shapiro urged congressional leaders to help `` bring U.S. law up to date and give us the legal framework we need to be able to protect ourselves . '' Until then , he said , U.S. naval escorts or government security teams will be required for U.S. vessels on high-risk transits . Shapiro was joined at the committee hearing by Phillips , who said the most desirable response would be the establishment of U.S. military escorts as well as military detachments . Phillips repeated an assertion he made before a separate Senate committee last week that arming vessels ' crews could provide an effective deterrent -- but only under certain limited circumstances . `` Unless the root causes of piracy are addressed -LSB- on land -RSB- , piracy will continue to expand and evolve into an even greater threat for American and foreign seamen , '' Phillips said . A Transportation Department official testifying at the hearing noted that the ships most vulnerable to attack are those built low to the water with insufficient top speeds . Ships need to be able to accelerate to `` a high rate of speed -LSB- for -RSB- aggressive maneuvering '' and should have high walls that are tough for pirates to scale , said Undersecretary of Transportation Roy Kienitz . He recommended that ship owners mandate a range of `` best practices , '' including having fire hoses to spray water over the side of a ship and extra manning for watches during dawn and dusk , when attacks are tougher to detect . Shapiro said that the crew of the Liberty Sun was able to fend off the pirate attack in part by rigging fire hoses to cover the stern of the vessel and `` create a virtual flood wall of water coming off the ship . '' Sen. Frank Lautenberg , D-New Jersey , applauded the efforts of the crews on both the Alabama and the Liberty Sun . `` These bandits have to be stopped , '' he said at the opening of the hearing . `` Violence and lawlessness will not be tolerated whether on land , in the sky or at sea . We have a duty to protect the ships that proudly fly America 's flag . ''
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States , Russia , China and other key nations have reached agreement on a `` strong '' Iran sanctions resolution , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday . Speaking before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Clinton said the United States has been `` working closely '' with its international partners -- the so-called P5 plus 1 -- on a resolution to present to the United Nations Security Council . She said they forged `` a strong draft with the cooperation of Russia and China , '' the two countries that have been reluctant to impose strong sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program . `` We plan to circulate the draft resolution to the entire Security Council today , '' said Clinton , who made the remarks before she began testifying about START , the U.S.-Russian treaty on nuclear arms . The P5 plus 1 comprises the five permanent member of the Security Council -- the United States , China , Russia , France , and Britain -- as well as Germany . The group has been concerned that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons . Iran has denied that claim , saying it wants to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes . Clinton noted an Iranian offer to send low-enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for highly enriched uranium but said it would not stop U.S. efforts to impose sanctions . `` We acknowledge the sincere efforts of both Turkey and Brazil to find a solution regarding Iran 's standoff with the international community over its nuclear program , '' Clinton told Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , citing the two countries that brokered the deal . But , she said , the P5 plus 1 `` are proceeding to rally the international community on behalf of a strong sanctions resolution that will , in our view , send an unmistakable message about what is expected from Iran . ''
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Coast Guard on Thursday is searching for two fishermen missing after a commercial fishing vessel went down in remote , treacherous waters off the Aleutian Islands about 1,400 miles southwest of Anchorage , Alaska . The fishing vessel Courageous helps search for missing men in waters off Alaska . Four of the boat 's crew members were rescued and five bodies retrieved Wednesday near the Amchitka Pass , a strait that connects the Bering Sea to the Pacific Ocean . The names have been withheld pending the notification of families , a Coast Guard statement said . `` What can you say ? '' said Jeff DeBell , chief financial officer of Katmai Fisheries , which owned the boat . He told The Associated Press , `` We are devastated by what has happened . We are elated there have been survivors . We are just terribly saddened by the ones that are dead and are praying that those that are still in the water are alive . '' The Seattle-based company told the AP the survivors were Capt. Henry Blake and crew members Guy Schroeder , Adam Foster and Harold Attling . The search began at about 1 a.m. Wednesday when the Coast Guard received an emergency signal from the Katmai , a 93-foot fishing vessel that had been battling 50-knot winds and nearly 20-foot waves . The signal originated from a wall-mounted satellite positioning device on the Katmai that reacts when it 's touched or splashed with water , Coast Guard Petty Officer Levi Read said . Watch a `` Deadliest Catch '' captain talk about what may have happened on the rough seas Â '' At about that time , another vessel , the Blue Balard , sent an e-mail to the Coast Guard saying that it received a message from the Katmai that water was flooding its rear compartment . The message also said that the vessel had lost steering . The Coast Guard tried to e-mail the Balard back but received no response , likely because the seas are remote and Internet access can be spotty , Read said . Rescuers launched a C-130 , a long-range surveillance aircraft , and went straight to the scene twice Wednesday morning , Read said . The boat was nowhere in sight , but the C-130 did spot two strobe lights on top of the water , he said . By this time , the weather was treacherous and the sky was darkening , according to Read . The C-130 , having found no signs of life , dropped two life rafts and headed back , he said . On the second trip , at 11 a.m. , the C-130 and a Jayhawk helicopter found two strobe lights floating in the water , one attached to a survival suit and the other to the emergency device that had first alerted the Coast Guard , Read said . They also found a body , he said . `` We knew the person was from the Katmai because the suit he was wearing had the name of the vessel on it , '' Read said . Roughly five hours later , the Coast Guard spotted four men on a life raft , all wearing survival suits . With the assistance of other vessels , the Courageous and the Patricia Lee , the bodies of four other men were recovered from the water , all wearing survival suits , Read said . The odds of someone surviving the frigid waters off Alaska 's Aleutian Islands is minimal , said Read . Crews usually have survival suits that allow water to seep inside but have a mechanism that traps body heat . The search for the two remaining men began at 9:30 a.m. Alaska time Thursday , an hour before sunrise there . `` You just could n't do anything earlier , '' Read said . `` It 's darker the farther out you go , and they are really , really out there . ''
KATHMANDU , Nepal -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Monsoon flooding has left 50,000 people homeless in Nepal and killed at least 74 people in northern India , according to officials . Monsoon rain has bought heavy flooding to southern Nepal , pictured , and northern India . The Nepalese army Thursday used helicopters to rescue residents in southeastern Nepal who were stranded on treetops and roofs after monsoon flooding forced more than 50,000 people from their homes . In northern India monsoon flooding destroyed mud huts and killed at least 74 people , officials said . The deaths were in the state of Uttar Pradesh . The latest casualties bring to more than 300 the number of people killed in India since the start of this year 's monsoon season . Nepalese officials said at least four southern villages were inundated with water after the embankment on the Saptakoshi River burst Monday . Some 40,000 people were now living in government-run relief camps ; others had gone to other villages to stay with relatives , authorities said . Nepalese Home Ministry officials said there were unconfirmed reports of deaths related to the flooding but authorities could not reach the affected areas to verify those reports . Police and army troops had been using elephants , boats and helicopters to rescue stranded villagers in Sunsari district , about 400 km -LRB- 249 miles -RRB- southeast of Kathmandu , since Monday . Nepal amd India are in the midst of the annual monsoon season .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A young blogger arrested in Iran for allegedly insulting supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an Internet posting has died in prison , his attorney said Friday . The blogger had been jailed for allegedly insulting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an internet posting . Attorney Mohammad Ali Dadkhah said Omid Mir Sayafi , reported to be in his 20s , died in Evin prison , which is located in Tehran and known for its wing that holds political prisoners . Dadkhah said a fellow inmate , Dr. Hessam Firouzi , called him Wednesday night with the news -- and said he believed Sayafi would have lived if he received proper medical care . Dadkhah said Firouzi , an imprisoned human-rights activist , said that he carried a semi-conscious Sayafi to a prison doctor but that he did n't receive the care he needed . `` It was Dr. Firouzi 's opinion that if he would 've received proper medical attention , he would not have died , '' Dadkhah said . He said Sayafi was buried on Thursday and that his calls to the prison asking for an explanation have not been returned . Dadkhah said Sayafi `` sounded OK '' at about 2 p.m. on Wednesday when he last spoke to him by telephone . He said the blogger asked for a book about Nowruz , the Iranian New Year , which begins Friday . The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , which advocates for activists in the country , quoted Firouzi on its Web site as saying Sayafi suffered from depression and had taken extra doses of medication on Wednesday . The group blamed Iran 's government for unsafe conditions in its prisons . `` Iranian leaders have relegated the administration of the prison system to a group of incompetent and cruel officials who are showing their utter disregard for human life , '' said Hadi Ghaemi , spokesman for the campaign . `` If the authorities do not move quickly to hold negligent officials responsible , they are reinforcing impunity and the lack of accountability . '' Sayafi was first arrested in April , then released for 41 days before being arrested again . He was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for comments on a blog that his lawyer argued was intended only for a few friends to read .
NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For the fourth year in a row , Iraqis top a growing roster of people seeking asylum in an industrialized nation . They are just ahead of people fleeing wars in Afghanistan and Somalia , said a report published by the U.N. refugee agency Wednesday . Iraqi refugees leave the plane after arriving at the airport in Hanover , northern Germany , on March 19 , 2009 . The refugee agency said 13,200 Iraqis applied for asylum . An additional 12,000 claims were from Afghans and 11,000 from Somalis . In all , the United Nations said 185,000 people filed for asylum in the first six months of 2009 , a 10 percent increase over last year . Those people were fleeing homelands that also included China , Serbia -LRB- including Kosovo -RRB- , Russia , Nigeria , Mexico , Zimbabwe , Pakistan and Sri Lanka . The United States received the most asylum applications -- 23,700 , or 13 percent -- while 38 European nations received 75 percent of the applications . `` These statistics show that ongoing violence and instability in some parts of the world force increasing numbers of people to flee and seek protection in safe countries , '' said Antonio Guterres , the U.N. high commissioner for refugees . `` There is an acute need for countries to keep their asylum doors wide open to those who are in genuine need of international protection , '' he said .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World Player of the Year Lionel Messi grabbed his second straight hat-trick in Spain 's La Liga to power Barcelona to a 4-2 in over Real Zaragoza on Sunday night . Messi , who scored twice in the midweek Champions League defeat of Stuttgart , has scored eight goals in a week and 11 of Barca 's last 14 . He is also he leading scorer in the league with 25 . The away victory sees the reigning champions draw level on points with leaders Real Madrid in the Spanish title race . They are a staggering 18 points clear of third placed Valencia , who won 2-0 against Almeria earlier in the day . It was Argentine star Messi 's fifth hat-trick while at the Catalan giants and followed his triple in the 3-0 win over Valencia last weekend . Barcelona were playing catch up after Real 's 3-1 win over Sporting Gijon the day before and were given the ideal start as Messi headed them in front on four minutes . His second goal came midway through the second half after a typically incisive run as the beat two players before scoring . Messi soon completed his hat-trick before a double from home substitute Adrian Colunga gave Zaragoza late hope . But Messi was not to be denied after his earlier heroics and won a penalty which Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic converted in injury time , his first league goal since February 14 . `` Messi did well , I 'll leave it for others to find the adjectives to describe him , '' Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola told AFP . . Valencia recovered from their drubbing against Barcelona and a midweek Europa League outing to post an easy win -- their first in three games . Almeria keeper Diego Alves kept them in the match which was scoreless at halftime , but he was beaten after the break as a fine pass from David Silva set up Juan Mata for the opener . Silva sealed the win as he scored from close range . Real Mallorca continued their fine form at home with a 4-1 thrashing of Atletico Madrid to stay in the fourth and final Champions League slot . Victor Casadesus scored their opener but Diego Forlan equalized for Atletico . But within two minutes Aritz Aduriz headed Mallorca in front again . Atletico had Raul Garcia sent off in the second half to seal their fate as a Luis Perea own goal and Felipe Mattioni strike made the game safe for Mallorca . `` We showed that we are a strong and ambitious side who are candidates for a place in Europe , '' a delighted Mallorca coach Gregorio Manzano told AFP . `` In the first half we were very good and then after the sending off we were able to control the play more easily . '' On Saturday , Real Madrid claimed their ninth straight victory but had to come from behind after David Barral scored . Real hit back through Rafael van der Vaart , Xabi Alonso and Gonzalo to open up a temporary three point gap on Barcelona .
MEXICO CITY , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One small slice Monday of Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's war on drug cartels : two shootouts on the streets of two cities ; a man and a woman ambushed in their car ; at least four people dead ; three soldiers wounded , one of them gravely . Suspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April . The confrontations between unidentified gunmen and Mexican army and federal police took place in the communities of San Nicolas de los Garza and Escobedo , near the U.S. border in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon , the state-run Notimex news agency said . One of the firefights lasted 45 minutes . At one point , the suspects launched hand grenades at the soldiers . House-to-house searches took two hours and it would be another seven hours before the areas were secured . According to Notimex and news reports from the newspapers Excelsior , El Porvenir , El Nuevo Leon and El Norte , here 's what happened : Around 6 a.m. , a military convoy came across a group armed men in several late-model vehicles in San Nicolas de los Garza . Shooting broke out , and the gunplay continued for 45 minutes along several neighboring streets as the suspects tried to get away . The armed men abandoned their cars , blocked one of the streets with a Suburban truck and fled aboard several other vehicles . The confrontation continued for another two hours as soldiers sealed off a city block and searched house-to-house . `` From early on , we could hear the shots and much shouting , '' Excelsior and El Nuevo Leon quoted an unidentified woman as saying . `` We could hear footsteps on the roofs and soldiers yelling to them . There were several explosions ; it seems like grenades went off , because we could hear it very loudly twice . '' Around 7:45 a.m. , the soldiers entered a house where the gunmen had holed up . A grenade went off upstairs . Three gunmen died there , though officials did not say if it was from bullet wounds or the grenade explosion . At the same time , Mexican military and federal police were involved in a shootout with armed men in Escobedo . That confrontation left three soldiers wounded , with one of them clinging to life Monday afternoon . Also nearby , a man and a woman riding in car were ambushed at an intersection by armed men in several cars who surrounded them and drilled their auto with bullets . The woman died on the scene , her body sprawled on the street . The man was wounded but survived . The violent scene in Nuevo Leon , which borders Texas , has become a near-daily experience in Mexico since Calderon took office in December 2006 and launched a war on drug cartels . More than 11,000 people have been killed during that time -- about 1,000 of them police and other authorities .
ATHENS , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Over the railroad tracks , near Agriculture Drive on the University of Georgia campus , sits a unique machine that may hold one of the solutions to big environmental problems like energy , food production and even global climate change . Biochar 's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water , nutrients , protect soil microbes . `` This machine right here is our baby , '' said UGA research engineer Brian Bibens , who is one of a handful of researchers around the world working on alternative ways to recycle carbon . Bibens ' specialty is `` biochar , '' a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste . The raw material can be any forest , agricultural or animal waste . Some examples are woodchips , corn husks , peanut shells , even chicken manure . Bibens feeds the waste -- called `` biomass '' -- into an octagonally shaped metal barrel where it is cooked under intense heat , sometimes above 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit , the organic matter is cooked through a thermochemical process called `` pyrolysis '' . In a few hours , organic trash is transformed into charcoal-like pellets farmers can turn into fertilizer . Gasses given off during the process can be harnesed to fuel vehicles of power electric generators . Watch how biochar is made and why it 's important '' Biochar is considered by many scientists to be the `` black gold '' for agriculture . Its high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water , nutrients , protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground . Biochar helps clean the air two ways : by preventing rotting biomass from releasing harmful CO2 into the atmosphere , and by allowing plants to safely store CO2 they pull out of the air during photosynthesis . See more about how biochar works '' `` Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool , increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere , '' said Christoph Steiner , one of the leading research scientist studying biochar . `` It gives us a chance to produce carbon negative energy . '' Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years , according to NASA scientist James Hansen . Global carbon levels in the air have been steadily increasing at an alarming rate since the 1980s , according to NOAA . Since 2000 , increases of 2 parts per million of CO2 have been common , according to NOAA . During the 1980s rates increased by 1.5 ppm per year . The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products . Some of the gases given off during the process can be converted to electricity , others can be condensed and converted to gasoline , and there are also some pharmaceutical applications for the by-products , said Danny Day President and CEO of Eprida , a private firm in Athens , Georgia currently exploring industry applications for the biochar process . Although scientists look to biochar to improve the future , its origin lies in the past . For centuries indigenous South Americans living in the Amazon Basin used a combination of charred animal waste and wood to make `` terra preta , '' which means black earth , in Portuguese . Thousands of years later , the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer , experts say . `` These terra preta soils are older than 500 years and they are still black soil and very rich in carbon , '' said Steiner , a professor at the University of Georgia . Reducing the need for deforestation to create more cropland . By using biochar concepts , terra preta soils have been proven to remain fertile for thousands of years , preventing further harmful deforestation for agricultural purposes . But still more large-scale tests need to be conducted before biochar technology can be rolled out on a global scale . Day says biomass -- that otherwise would be thrown away -- could be developed into entirely new markets for biofuels , electricity , biomass extracts and pharmaceutical applications , in addition to biochar . `` We have 3 billion people out there who are at risk for climate change and they can be making money solving our global problem , '' said Day . Industries can now begin to look at farmers around the world and pay them for their agricultural wastes , said Day . `` They can become the new affluent . ''
CHICAGO , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barack Obama did more than thump John McCain in the Electoral College tally ; he also handily won the popular vote and redrew the great divide between red states and blue states .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Austrian officials are seeking to secure the release of two Austrian nationals who were kidnapped by an al Qaeda group while vacationing in North Africa ahead of a midnight Sunday deadline . Reinhard and Christine Lenz , right , the parents of kidnapped Austrian Andrea Kloiber . `` There are efforts in all areas , unrelenting efforts to secure the earliest possible release of our citizens , '' Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal told CNN . The team of high-ranking government officials met Sunday morning and planned to work throughout the day , he said . Wolfgang Ebner , 51 , and Andrea Kloiber , 44 , were last heard from on February 18 while on a vacation in southern Tunisia , foreign ministry spokesman Martin Gaertner said . Earlier this month , the Austrian government received an audio message via the Internet from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claiming to have kidnapped the pair . The kidnappers ' primary demand is the release of five prisoners in Algeria and Tunisia , Launsky-Tieffenthal said . While the kidnappers have set a midnight deadline , there are preliminary indications that it may be extended , he said . The government is in contact with authorities in Tunisia , Algeria , and Mali in an effort to find the missing duo , who are from the Austrian town of Hallein . A few weeks ago , the kidnappers released a set of written demands and six photographs that include images of the Austrians . Among the images was one that appeared to show the pair flanked by men holding assault rifles and a rocket launcher . Another appeared to show more than 15 group members -- several of them armed . Kloiber 's face is obscured in all of the photographs in which she appears . E-mail to a friend

He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America . John Feehery says Republicans are poised to bounce back for several reasons . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` It is important for us to have a strong Republican Party , '' Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tauntingly told a press conference on April 23 . `` And I hope that the next generation will take back the Republican Party for the Grand Old Party that it used to be . '' Thanks Mrs. Pelosi , for your best wishes . But be careful what you wish for . I would n't write the obituary for the Republican Party quite yet . Sure , things are looking grim at the moment . Yes , our Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele stumbled out of the starting gate , making several verbal gaffes , and raising questions about his competence . Yes , the latest poll numbers are in the toilet , showing only 21 percent of the American people call themselves Republicans . Yes , Arlen Specter decided the GOP was a drag on his personal political future . And yes , we lost a special election in upstate New York that maybe we should have won . But things change . Remember a year-and-a-half ago , when everybody thought the election would be a referendum on the Iraq war . Remember 10 months ago , when everyone thought that expensive gas was going to drive people to the polls . It turned out that , by the time of the election , the most important thing that people cared about was their declining 401ks or their lost job . Here are five reasons why the Republican Party will be back and perhaps sooner than anyone thinks : 1 -RRB- Overreach : Several of my Democratic friends over the last several months have tried to comfort me when discussing the fall of the Republican Party with one consoling thought : Do n't worry , we will screw it up . And on that one thing I agree with them . The liberal Democrats that currently run the Congress are destined to overreach on the legislative front . Pelosi and her California allies , like Reps. Henry Waxman , George Miller and Pete Stark , tend to think the rest of America wants the same things they do , from higher taxes on energy to a national health care plan that could be a blueprint for socialized medicine , from abortion on demand to gay marriage . But most Americans actually look at California as an economic basket case and social mess . It is a beautiful state , but it is also completely screwed-up , thanks largely to liberal governance . The Democrats are certain to overdo it on the liberalism , and that will make the Republicans much more attractive in two to four years . 2 -RRB- Checks and balances : Unlike the parliamentary governments of Europe , where one party runs everything until they mess up , the American system actually gives a preference to both parties having skin in the game . While most voters do n't actually think `` divided government '' when they go to the polls , they do think that one-party government tends to lead to excess and corruption . That is why the people have a chance a mere two years after the president gets elected to give him a midterm report card in the form of Congressional elections . Most polls now show voters prefer a candidate who will serve as a check on President Obama 's power . And for most voters , who see Pelosi and Nevada Sen. Harry Reid as even more liberal than the president , Republicans will serve as that check . 3 -RRB- Crisis breeds renewal : When things are going well , a political party tends to discourage independent thought and enforce philosophical orthodoxy . But when a political party faces crisis , all of that goes out the window . It is a wide-open world right now for Republicans as they debate amongst themselves what the party truly stands for . The debate will be painful , as neoconservatives , paleo-conservatives , progressive conservatives , moderates and libertarians battle it out to chart the course for a new and more vibrant party . Republicans can afford to have these debates now when they are in the minority , because frankly , they have nothing else to do . The Democrats went through this process in the mid-90s , and they built a new party that attracted centrists like Mark Warner , without alienating old-line liberals like Pelosi or Waxman . 4 -RRB- Talent senses opportunity : Investors know that the time to buy is not when the market is at its peak , but when the market is at the bottom . But it is not always easy to know when the bottom hits . In politics , it is pretty easy to know when a party has hit the bottom . And for the Republicans , it is now . Talented political entrepreneurs look to the GOP and see nothing but opportunity . The old bulls have been wiped out . The new guard is ready to start leading . In the House , young guns like Eric Cantor , Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan are charting the future for the next Republican takeover . Adam Putnam of Florida and Mark Kirk of Illinois are getting ready for state-wide runs . But it is not just the young guns . It also more experienced politicians , John Kasich and Rob Portman of Ohio , Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania , Jeb Bush of Florida , who see an opportunity to lead the party back to power . 5 -RRB- The Republican Party is the de facto Libertarian Party : Most people I talk to think of themselves not as Republicans or Democrats , but as libertarians . Not libertarians in the political party sense , but libertarians in a deeper philosophical sense . They tend to want government to stay out of their lives as much as possible . They tend to distrust all politicians , and when they hear someone say , `` I am from the government , and I am here to help , '' they tend to laugh uproariously . It was Will Rogers who said , `` I do n't make jokes . I just watch the government and report the facts . '' The Republican Party does best when it seeks to reform government , to lessen the power of the bureaucrat , and to fight to give more freedom to the people . When the GOP returns to that philosophical creed -- which it will do in the face of the Obama administration 's vast expansion of government power -- its fortunes will brighten again . If the Republican Party were a stock , the smart investor would start buying it now . Yes , things look grim at the present time , but things change . The GOP is not dead yet , and Speaker Pelosi may see her wish of a resurgent Republican Party come true quicker than she anticipated .

WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rep. Julia Carson , a former secretary who rose to become Indianapolis ' first African-American congresswoman , has announced she has terminal lung cancer , a newspaper reports . Health problems have troubled Rep. Julia Carson , D-Indiana , for years . The 69-year-old former City-County Council member and state senator told the Indianapolis Star on Saturday that she had been on a leave of absence since September to seek treatment and rehabilitation for a leg infection . `` Then the second shoe fell -- heavily , '' Carson told the paper in a brief written statement . `` My doctor discovered lung cancer . It had gone into remission years before , but it was back with a terminal vengeance . '' Representing the Hoosier State 's 7th District since 1997 , Carson opposed the Iraq war resolution in 2002 and worked to honor historic civil rights figure Rosa Parks . Fellow Democrats praised her as a bright personality who successfully fought against abuse of the welfare system . Rozelle Boyd , a longtime Democratic member of Indianapolis ' City-County Council told the Star he was surprised by Carson 's announcement . `` She was able to walk with giants without losing the common touch , '' he told the paper . `` That is what I think was so very important to her and to the people of the district . '' Before entering the House , Carson served six years as a trustee for the city 's Center Township , creating a $ 6-million surplus from the office 's $ 20-million debt , the Star reported . Her mentor , former Democratic Indiana Rep. Andy Jacobs , has said Carson `` not only took cheats off the welfare rolls , she sued them to get the money , '' according to the Star . Early in her career , Carson worked as a secretary and then aide to Jacobs . After her work on the City-County Council , she won her first of two terms to the Indiana House , according to Congressional Quarterly . Later she won election to the state Senate , where she served until 1991 . When Jacobs retired after serving 15 terms in the U.S. House , he endorsed Carson as his successor , and helped her win a difficult election in 1996 against GOP attempts to capture her seat , Congressional Quarterly reported . Carson was the first woman and first African-American Indianapolis had ever sent to Congress , according to her Web site . Among her other achievements , Carson led Congress to pass a House measure awarding Parks the Congressional Gold Medal , Carson 's Web site said . The Star named her Woman of the Year in 1991 and 1974 . `` Julia to me is one of the most beautiful people with a great personality , '' said State Sen. Glenn Howard , an Indianapolis Democrat . `` She cares about everyone , regardless of race or color . '' Carson has been beset by health problems . In January 1997 , she took her House oath of office at Indianapolis ' Methodist Hospital as she recovered from double-bypass surgery , according to the Star . She also has suffered from high blood pressure , asthma and diabetes , according to Congressional Quarterly . In 2004 , Carson missed almost a third of House roll call votes , Congressional Quarterly reported , prompting tough questions about her health during that year 's re-election campaign . Voters returned her to Congress by an 11 percent margin . She 's the sponsor of the House National Defense Rail Act , legislation before Congress which would provide more than $ 40 billion to develop high-speed rail connections and short-distance corridors between larger cities , her Web site said .
