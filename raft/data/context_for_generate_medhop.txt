DB08820 : the first therapy acting on the primary cause of cystic fibrosis . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is a life-shortening disorder that affects over 30,000 people in the U.S. and 70,000 worldwide . CF is caused by mutations in the P13569 gene , which codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) protein . P13569 is a chloride and bicarbonate channel and regulates several ion transporters at the epithelial cell membrane , controlling hydration or ionic composition of epithelial secretions . Management of CF is currently supportive , but recent advances in drug development have focused on therapies that assist mutant P13569 function . In the current review , we summarize the development and clinical experience with VX-770 ( ivacaftor ) , a small molecule that increases P13569 chloride conductance in vitro and in vivo , including wild-type and G551D P13569 . The G551D P13569 mutation is the third most common CF disease-causing mutation , in which the P13569 protein localizes to the epithelial cell membrane but has defective gating . With restoration of adequate P13569 function through pharmacotherapy , it is possible that the clinical course of patients with CF could be markedly improved , including longevity , quality of life and treatment burden . Multiplex protein signature for the detection of bladder cancer in voided urine samples . PURPOSE : Accurate urine assays for bladder cancer detection would benefit patients and health care systems . Through extensive genomic and proteomic profiling of urine components we previously identified a panel of 8 biomarkers that can facilitate the detection of bladder cancer in voided urine samples . In this study we confirmed this diagnostic molecular signature in a diverse multicenter cohort . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We performed a case-control , phase II study in which we analyzed voided urine from 102 subjects with bladder cancer and 206 with varying urological disorders . The urinary concentration of 8 biomarkers ( P10145 , P14780 and 10 , P05121 , P15692 , P03950 , Q16790 and P02649 ) was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Diagnostic performance of the panel of tested biomarkers was evaluated using ROCs and descriptive statistical values , eg sensitivity and specificity . RESULTS : Seven of the 8 urine biomarkers were increased in subjects with bladder cancer relative to those without bladder cancer . The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model , which had an AUROC of 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.84-0.93 ) , and 74 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity . In contrast , the sensitivity of voided urine cytology and the UroVysion® cytogenetic test in this cohort was 39 % and 54 % , respectively . Study limitations include analysis performed on banked urine samples and the lack of voided urine cytology and cytogenetic test data on controls . CONCLUSIONS : The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays . Expression profile of genes associated with the dopamine pathway in vitiligo skin biopsies and blood sera . BACKGROUND : Dopamine has been proven to be toxic for melanocytes . In vitiligo patients the level of dopamine is increased and the functioning of several enzymes participating in the dopamine pathway is changed . METHODS : With the use of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and ELISA the expression of genes connected to the dopamine pathway ( PAH , P61457 , TH , DDC , P09172 , PNMT , P07203 , P21397 , P27338 , P21964 , P21728 - P21918 , P54219 and Q05940 ) was observed in vitiligo patients ' and control subjects ' skin and blood . RESULTS : The mRNA expression of P07203 , DDC , P21397 , P21728 and P21918 differs in vitiligo skin and the protein level of DDC , P21397 , P27338 , P21728 and P21918 is changed in vitiligo patients ' skin and/or blood sera . CONCLUSIONS : The dopamine pathway probably influences melanogenesis directly or through the melanocortin pathway . We provide new data about changes of expression profile of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme DDC , the dopamine-degrading enzymes P21397 and P27338 and the D1-like family dopamine receptors in vitiligo skin and blood sera . Role of histamine receptors in the effects of histamine on the production of reactive oxygen species by whole blood phagocytes . AIMS : The diverse physiological functions of histamine are mediated through distinct histamine receptors . In this study we investigated the role of P25021 and Q9H3N8 in the effects of histamine on the production of reactive oxygen species by phagocytes in whole blood . MAIN METHODS : Changes in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production by whole blood phagocytes after treatment with histamine , Q9H3N8 agonists ( 4-methylhistamine , VUF8430 ) , P25021 agonist ( dimaprit ) and their combinations with Q9H3N8 antagonist ( JNJ10191584 ) and P25021 antagonist ( ranitidine ) were determined using the chemiluminescence ( CL ) assay . To exclude the direct scavenging effects of the studied compounds on the CL response , the antioxidant properties of all compounds were measured using several methods ( TRAP , ORAC , and luminol-HRP-H2O2 based CL ) . KEY FINDINGS : DB11320 , 4-methylhistamine , VUF8430 and dimaprit inhibited the spontaneous and OZP-activated whole blood CL in a dose-dependent manner . On the other hand , only VUF8430 was able to inhibit PMA-activated whole blood CL . DB00863 , but not JNJ10191584 , completely reduced the effects of histamine , 4-methylhistamine and dimaprit . The direct scavenging ability of tested compounds was negligible . SIGNIFICANCE : Our results demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of histamine on ROS production in whole blood phagocytes were caused by P25021 . Our results also suggest that Q9H3N8 agonists in concentrations higher than 10(-6)M may also influence ROS production via binding to P25021 . P05231 and P10145 increase the expression of glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of sialylated and/or sulfated Lewisx epitopes in the human bronchial mucosa . Bronchial mucins from patients suffering from CF ( cystic fibrosis ) exhibit glycosylation alterations , especially increased amounts of the sialyl-Lewis(x) ( NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4[Fucalpha1-3]GlcNAc-R ) and 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis(x) ( NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4[Fucalpha1-3][SO(3)H-6]GlcNAc-R ) terminal structures . These epitopes are preferential receptors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa , the bacteria responsible for the chronicity of airway infection and involved in the morbidity and early death of CF patients . However , these glycosylation changes can not be directly linked to defects in P13569 ( CF transmembrane conductance regulator ) gene expression since cells that secrete airway mucins express no or very low amounts of the protein . Several studies have shown that inflammation may affect glycosylation and sulfation of various glycoproteins , including mucins . In the present study , we show that incubation of macroscopically healthy fragments of human bronchial mucosa with P05231 ( interleukin-6 ) or P10145 results in a significant increase in the expression of alpha1,3/4-fucosyltransferases [ Q495W5 ( fucosyltransferase 11 gene ) and P21217 ] , alpha2-6- and alpha2,3-sialyltransferases [ Q9Y274 ( alpha2,3-sialyltransferase 6 gene ) and Q96JF0 ( alpha2,6-sialyltransferase 2 gene ) ] and GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases [ Q8NCG5 ( carbohydrate sulfotransferase 4 gene ) and Q9GZX3 ] mRNA . In parallel , the amounts of sialyl-Lewis(x) and 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis(x) epitopes at the periphery of high-molecular-mass proteins , including Q99102 , were also increased . In conclusion , our results indicate that P05231 and -8 may contribute to the increased levels of sialyl-Lewis(x) and 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis(x) epitopes on human airway mucins from patients with CF . Possible differences in the mechanism(s) of action of different glucocorticoid hormone compounds . Different glucocorticoid hormones ( P30793 ) show differences in the intensity and in the kinetics of their immunomodulating activity . The mechanism(s) of action of P30793 is under investigation , but is has been noted that they exert immune activity via the genomic pathway . We have studied the effects of prednisone ( PDN ) , deflazacort ( DFC ) , and dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) on the production of cytokines ( P60568 , P05231 , P01375 , P22301 ) by peripheral T lymphocytes , and the effects on the inhibition of NF-kB DNA binding activity by activated Jurkat cell line . The data obtained show that the three P30793 molecules exert an immunosuppression on cytokine production by T lymphocytes and a strong decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-kB in Jurkat cells ; moreover , ( a ) not all the cytokines investigated were affected , and not with the same intensity , by the three P30793 and ( b ) DB00514 inhibited the binding activity of NF-kB less than that of DFC and PDN . These data are in agreement with the concept that different P30793 compounds might differ in their binding and affinity properties , tissue-specific metabolism , and interaction with transcription factor . Ras-transfection up-regulated HaCaT cell migration : inhibition by Marimastat . Cell migration is an essential process in physiological and pathological conditions such as wound healing and tumor invasion . This phenomenon involves cell adhesion on the extracellular matrix mediated by integrins , and cell detachment promoted in part by metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . In the present study , the migration of two HaCaT-ras clones ( metastatic or not ) , was compared with HaCaT cells , and normal human primary cultured keratinocytes . Using colloidal gold migration assay , the migration index on type I and type IV collagen was similar for primary cultured keratinocytes and HaCaT , whereas it was markedly higher for the HaCaT-ras clones . High motility of ras-transfected cells was confirmed from an in vitro wound healing assay . It was not correlated with changes in integrin expression or related to a different adhesion on extracellular matrix . The Marismastat ( DB00786 ) , a MMP inhibitor , inhibited in a dose-dependent effect the migration in both assays , demonstrating the important role of MMPs in the migration process . Under our experimental conditions , P03956 activity was not detected in HaCaT and P14780 activity was secreted by these cells only after their stimulation by P01133 . Here , P08253 was the major gelatinolytic activity secreted by all the cells and its secretion was markedly higher for HaCaT-nis clones compared with HaCaT . In addition , Western blotting results confirmed a higher expression of P08253 associated with a lower expression of P16035 in HaCaT-ras compared with HaCaT . These results suggest that Ha-ras oncogene could be a stimulating factor of migration and might modified the balance between P08253 and P16035 in keratinocyte cell lines . [ Moclobemide ( DB01171 ) , the first P21397 -inhibitor : really something new ? ] . PPARγ and RXR ligands disrupt the inflammatory cross-talk in the hypoxic breast cancer stem cells niche . Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) are affected by the local micro-environment , the niche , in which inflammatory stimuli and hypoxia act as steering factors . Here , two nuclear receptors ( NRs ) agonists , i.e. pioglitazone ( PGZ ) , a ligand of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ , and 6-OH-11-O-hydroxyphenanthrene ( IIF ) , a ligand of retinoid X receptors , were investigated for their capability to interference with the cross-talk between breast CSCs and the niche compartment . We found that IIF potentiates the ability of PGZ to hamper the mammospheres-forming capability of human breast tumours and MCF7 cancer cells , reducing the expression of CSCs regulatory genes ( Notch3 , P78504 , O43623 , P05231 , P02649 , Hypoxia inducible factor-1α and Q16790 ) . Notably , these effects are not observed in normal-MS obtained from human breast tissue . Importantly , NRs agonists abolish the capability of hypoxic MCF7 derived exosomes to induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in mammary glands fibroblasts . Moreover , NRs agonist also directly acts on breast tumour associated fibroblasts to downregulate nuclear factor-κB pathway and metalloproteinases ( P08253 and P14780 ) expression and activity . In conclusion , NRs agonists disrupt the inflammatory cross-talk of the hypoxic breast CSCs niche . Genotype frequencies of 50 polymorphisms for 241 Japanese non-cancer patients . This paper lists the genotype frequencies of 50 polymorphisms of 37 genes ( P05091 , P07550 , P13945 , P21964 , P16671 , P25025 , P24385 , P35354 , P11509 , P05093 , P11511 , IGF1 , IL-1A , IL-1B , IL-1RN , IL-1R1 , P05231 , P10145 , P22301 , P41159 , Le , L-myc , P05164 , Q99707 , P42898 , P21397 , P15559 , O15527 , p53 , p73 , Se , P31213 , TGF-B , P01375 -A , P01375 -B , P18074 , and P18887 ) and 6 sets of combined genotype frequencies for 241 non-cancer Japanese outpatients . Though the genotype frequencies of 25 polymorphisms have already been reported in our previous papers , 15 polymorphisms ( P16671 A52C , P25025 C785T , P24385 G870A , IGF1 C/T at intron 2 and G2502T , IL-1A 46-bp VNTR , IL-1R1 C-116T , P05231 Ins/Del 17C , P10145 A-278T and C74T , IL- 10 T-819C , P41159 A-2548G , P31213 2-bp VNTR , P18074 Lys751Gln , and P18887 Arg399Gln ) and six sets of combined genotype frequencies ( IL-1B C-31T and IL-1A C-889T , IL-1B C-31T and IL-1RN 86-bp VNTR , IL-1B C-31T and IL-1R1 C-116T , P01375 -A G-308A and P01375 -B A252G , P31213 Val89Leu and 2-bp VNTR , and P18887 Arg399Gln and P18074 Lys751Gln ) were reported in this paper for the first time for Japanese . Although microarray technology will produce this kind of information in near future , this is the first document that reports the genotype/allele frequencies among Japanese for an archival purpose . Genetic factors influencing outcome from neurotrauma . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Clinical outcome after neurotrauma is considerably variable and can only partly be explained by known prognostic factors . There is converging evidence from genetic research that a number of genetic variants may contribute to this variability . This review provides recent data from human studies , published in the previous year , on genetic factors influencing outcome after neurotrauma . The bibliographic databases MEDLINE , EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched to identify relevant studies . RECENT FINDINGS : Genetic susceptibility to various aspects of clinical outcome after neurotrauma was reported in recent clinical studies . Genetic loci investigated include polymorphisms in P02649 , P21397 , P23560 , NOS3 , P05231 , P12036 , P31645 , P21964 , P48454 and Q8IX03 genes . The importance of these findings and future directions are discussed . SUMMARY : Recent genetic studies have revealed emerging aspects and extended the existing knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of neurotrauma and the genetic influence on phenotypic diversity . A better understanding of the underlying biological pathways and molecular mechanisms of an individual 's response to neurotrauma may hold the promise of novel treatment strategies and improved clinical outcome . P30047 -dependent and -independent inhibitors of P30793 . P30047 ( P30047 ) mediates the feedback inhibition of P30793 activity by ( 6R ) -L-erythro- DB00360 ( BH4 ) through protein complex formation . Since guanine and BH4 have a common pyrimidine ring structure , we examined the inhibitory effect of guanine and its analogs on the enzyme activity . DB02377 , 8-hydroxyguanine , 8-methylguanine , and 8-bromoguanine inhibited the enzyme activity in a P30047 -dependent and pH-dependent manner and induced complex formation between P30793 and P30047 . The type of inhibition by this group is a mixed type . All these properties were shared with BH4 . In striking contrast , inhibition by DB01667 and 8-mercaptoguanine was P30047 -independent and pH-independent . The type of inhibition by DB01667 and 8-mercaptoguanine was a competitive type . The two compounds did not induce complex formation between the enzyme and P30047 . These results demonstrate that guanine compounds of the first group bind to the BH4-binding site of the P30793 / P30047 complex , whereas DB01667 and 8-mercaptoguanine bind to the active site of the enzyme . Finally , the possible implications in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and Parkinson diseases of the inhibition of P30793 by guanine and 8-hydroxyguanine are discussed . FcεRI stimulation promotes the differentiation of histamine receptor 1-expressing inflammatory macrophages . BACKGROUND : Monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells or macrophages and recruitment to peripheral organs in chronic inflammatory diseases are directed by allergen challenge via FcεRI as well as the nature of soluble factors in the microenvironment . High-affinity receptor for IgE stimulation of effector cells results in the release of histamine , which acts on various histamine receptors ( HR ) 1-4 , expressed by immune cells . METHODS : We examined the effect of FcεRI stimulation of human monocytes on P35367 expression and function of differentiating cells . The mRNA levels of P35367 , P25021 and histidine decarboxylase of differentiating cells were detected by quantitative real-time PCR . Expression of CD1c , CD11c , P34810 and Q86VB7 was detected by flow cytometry . Amount of histamine , P05231 and IL-12p70 in the cell culture was measured with the help of cytometric bead arrays or ELISA assays . Numbers of P35367 -expressing macrophages were evaluated by immunofluorescence double staining of P34810 and P35367 on human skin sections . RESULTS : We demonstrated that FcεRI stimulation promotes the generation of P35367 -expressing macrophage-like cells with enhanced histamine biosynthesis and P35367 -mediated proinflammatory properties . Supporting our in vitro findings , high numbers of P35367 -expressing P34810 (pos) macrophages were detected in the dermis of atopic dermatitis ( AD ) skin lesions . CONCLUSION : Our observations point to a close histamine-/HR-mediated activation of dermal macrophages , leading to modified cell differentiation and responsiveness via P35367 , which might contribute to the aggravation of allergic skin inflammation in AD . Decreased exercise-induced expression of nuclear factor-κB-regulated genes in muscle of patients with P48444 . BACKGROUND : Nuclear factor ( NF ) -κB activation and oxidative stress are physiologic responses of skeletal muscle to exercise but may be impaired in patients with P48444 . Therefore , we investigated NF-κB activity and expression of NF-κB-regulated genes in muscle of patients with P48444 and control subjects before and after exercise . METHODS : Quadriceps specimens were obtained before , immediately after , and 2 h after a submaximal cycle ergometry test from seven patients with P48444 ( 50.6 ± 5.7 SEM Q99581 (1) of patients with P48444 ) and seven age-matched control subjects . NF-κB DNA-binding activity in muscle and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , respectively . mRNA expression and protein carbonylation were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot , respectively . RESULTS : In control subjects , P05231 , IκBα , tumor necrosis factor-α , IL-1β , superoxide dismutase , thioredoxin , heme oxygenase 1 , and heat shock protein-70 were upregulated in muscle after exercise , whereas in patients with P48444 only P05231 mRNA was increased . Exercise-induced antiapoptotic Bcl2 mRNA levels were attenuated in patients with P48444 compared with control subjects . Basal muscle protein oxidation was higher in patients with P48444 than in control subjects , but attenuated in response to exercise . No exercise-induced changes in NF-κB DNA-binding activity in muscle and PBMCs of either group were detected . CONCLUSIONS : Skeletal muscle of patients with P48444 is characterized by an impaired response to exercise of NF-κB-regulated genes encoding inflammatory cytokines , antioxidants , stress proteins , and survival factors . Technology evaluation : DB06101 , ImClone Systems . ImClone is developing IMC-IC11 , an anti-angiogenesis chimeric monoclonal antibody specific vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( P35968 , also known Flk-1 in mice ) , for the potential treatment of cancer [ 156625 ] ; it in phase I trials for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma [ 379143 ] . The related antibody DC-101 provided proof-of-principle that an anti- P15692 receptor antibody could strongly inhibit tumor growth and even cause tumor regression with the glioblastoma tumor cell line , GBM18 [ 388236 ] . In May 1998 , the company was granted US-05747651 by the USPTO , covering antibodies against the extracellular portion of the P35968 / P35968 receptor [ 284054 ] . DB05812 acetate : in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer . Oral abiraterone acetate , in combination with prednisone/prednisolone , is used to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) who have previously received docetaxel-containing chemotherapy . DB05812 acetate was developed to specifically inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP)17A1 , which is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of testosterone . In a pivotal phase III trial in patients with metastatic CRPC who have previously received docetaxel-containing chemotherapy , abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily significantly prolonged overall survival compared with placebo plus prednisone . In this trial , abiraterone acetate plus prednisone was significantly more effective than placebo plus prednisone in prolonging the time to prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression and in prolonging progression-free survival . Significantly more abiraterone acetate plus prednisone recipients than placebo plus prednisone recipients were considered to be responders , when assessed by PSA levels or radiographic imaging . Treatment with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in the phase III trial was associated with an acceptable tolerability profile , which was generally similar to that of the placebo plus prednisone group . However , adverse events of special interest ( e.g. cardiac disorders and liver-function test abnormalities and adverse events resulting from elevated mineralocorticoid levels because of P05093 inhibition [ i.e. fluid retention and oedema , hypokalaemia , hypertension ] ) occurred in significantly more abiraterone acetate plus prednisone than in placebo plus prednisone recipients . Expression of serotonergic system components during early Xenopus embryogenesis . Despite abundant research studies on the physiological and biochemical nature of embryonic neurotransmitter function , little is known about the molecular genetic mechanisms involved . The expression of the main components of the serotonergic system during early Xenopus embryogenesis was investigated using RT-PCR , real time PCR and in situ hybridization . Transcripts encoding the serotonin receptors P28335 and P34969 , as well as the vesicular monoamine transporter Q05940 , the serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) and the serotonin synthesis enzymes tryptophan hydroxylase ( Q8IWU9 ) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( AAAD ) were found to be expressed during the cleavage division stages , whereas the degradation enzyme monoamine oxidase A ( P21397 ) was absent . The main components of the serotonergic system were found to be expressed during the earliest stages of embryonic development . The embryonic transmitter mechanism , its complexity , and its variability among various species are discussed . Derivatization of ( ± ) dihydrotetrabenazine for copper-64 labeling towards long-lived radiotracers for PET imaging of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 . Dihydrotetrabenazine ( DTBZ ) derivatized from ( + ) DB04844 ( TBZ ) has been used for imaging the expression of Q05940 when labeled with (11)C ( t1/2=20.3 min ) or (18)F ( t1/2=110 min ) in neurodegenerative diseases or pancreatic beta-cell . Because (11)C or (18)F radiolabels are only available in the proximity of a biomedical cyclotron facility , here we report our work of derivatizing ( + ) and ( - ) DTBZ using a (64)Cu-specific bifunctional chelator scaffold ( (64)Cu : t1/2=12.7 h ) for the preparation of long-lived Q05940 targeted radiotracers , (64)Cu-CB-TE2A-(+)-DTBZ and (64)Cu-CB-TE2A-(-)-DTBZ . The specific Q05940 binding affinity of (64)Cu-CB-TE2A-(+)-DTBZ measured using rat brain homogenate or porcine islets was not compromised by our chemical modifications while that of its ( - ) counterpart remained low as in (11)C or (18)F labeled ( ± ) DTBZ . New obesity agents : lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the evidence for lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate in the treatment of obesity . DATA SOURCES : Literature was accessed through PubMed ( June 1975-March 2013 ) using the search terms lorcaserin , phentermine , topiramate , or phenter mine/topiramate . Additionally , reference citations from publications identified were reviewed . Additional information was obtained from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved prescribing information and FDA briefing documents . STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION : English-language articles focusing on Phase 3 clinical trials for obesity were critiqued . Data from preclinical and Phase 1 and/or 2 trials are reported when appropriate . Six prospective Phase 3 trials were reviewed . DATA SYNTHESIS : Obesity has reached epidemic proportions , affecting more than one third of adults in the US . Two medication products , lorcaserin and phenter mine/topiramate , have recently received FDA approval as adjuncts to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity among individuals with a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2) or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m(2) with an obesity-related comorbidity , such as hypertension , dyslipidemia , or diabetes . DB04871 is a selective serotonin P28335 agonist that regulates food intake , while the combination of phentermine/topiramate causes appetite suppression and enhanced satiety . Three Phase 3 randomized , placebo-controlled trials reported approximately 75 % and 45 % of patients achieved greater than or equal to 5 % weight loss with phentermine/topiramate and lorcaserin , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : With lifestyle modification , phentermine/topiramate appears most effective in terms of weight loss . DB04871 demonstrates moderate efficacy . Long-term cardiovascular outcomes studies are needed to confirm the safety and benefit of these new obesity agents . Cross-talk between PKA-Cβ and p65 mediates synergistic induction of Q07343 by roflumilast and NTHi . Phosphodiesterase 4B ( Q07343 ) plays a key role in regulating inflammation . DB01656 , a phosphodiesterase (PDE)4-selective inhibitor , has recently been approved for treating severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) patients with exacerbation . However , there is also clinical evidence suggesting the development of tachyphylaxis or tolerance on repeated dosing of roflumilast and the possible contribution of Q07343 up-regulation , which could be counterproductive for suppressing inflammation . Thus , understanding how Q07343 is up-regulated in the context of the complex pathogenesis and medications of P48444 may help improve the efficacy and possibly ameliorate the tolerance of roflumilast . Here we show that roflumilast synergizes with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) , a major bacterial cause of P48444 exacerbation , to up-regulate PDE4B2 expression in human airway epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo . Up-regulated PDE4B2 contributes to the induction of certain important chemokines in both enzymatic activity-dependent and activity-independent manners . We also found that protein kinase A catalytic subunit β ( PKA-Cβ ) and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) p65 subunit were required for the synergistic induction of PDE4B2 . PKA-Cβ phosphorylates p65 in a DB02527 -dependent manner . Moreover , Ser276 of p65 is critical for mediating the PKA-Cβ-induced p65 phosphorylation and the synergistic induction of PDE4B2 . Collectively , our data unveil a previously unidentified mechanism underlying synergistic up-regulation of PDE4B2 via a cross-talk between PKA-Cβ and p65 and may help develop new therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of DB05876 inhibitor .
Vascular proinflammatory responses by aldosterone are mediated via c-Src trafficking to cholesterol-rich microdomains : role of P09619 . AIMS : We demonstrated c-Src activation as a novel non-genomic signalling pathway for aldosterone in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . Here , we investigated molecular mechanisms and biological responses of this phenomenon , focusing on the role of lipid rafts/caveolae and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) in c-Src-regulated proinflammatory responses by aldosterone . METHODS AND RESULTS : Studies were performed in cultured VSMCs from Wistar-Kyoto ( WKY ) rats and caveolin-1 knockout ( Cav 1(-/-) ) and wild-type mice . DB04630 stimulation increased c-Src phosphorylation and trafficking to lipid rafts/caveolae . DB04540 depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin abrogated aldosterone-induced phosphorylation of c-Src and its target , Pyk2 . DB04630 effects were recovered by cholesterol reload . DB04630 -induced c-Src and cortactin phosphorylation was reduced in caveolin-1-silenced and Cav 1(-/-) VSMCs . P09619 is phosphorylated by aldosterone within cholesterol-rich fractions of VSMCs . AG1296 , a P09619 inhibitor , prevented c-Src phosphorylation and translocation to cholesterol-rich fractions . DB04630 induced an increase in adhesion molecule protein content and promoted monocyte adhesion to VSMCs , responses that were inhibited an by cholesterol depletion , caveolin-1 deficiency , AG1296 and Q99463 , a c-Src inhibitor . P08235 ( MR ) content in flotillin-2-rich fractions and co-immunoprecipitation with c-Src and P09619 increased upon aldosterone stimulation , indicating MR-lipid raft/signalling association . CONCLUSION : We demonstrate that aldosterone-mediated c-Src trafficking/activation and proinflammatory signalling involve lipid rafts/caveolae via P09619 . Endothelial dihydrofolate reductase : critical for nitric oxide bioavailability and role in angiotensin II uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase . Recent studies demonstrate that oxidative inactivation of tetrahydrobiopterin ( H4B ) may cause uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) to produce superoxide ( O2*- ) . H4B was found recyclable from its oxidized form by dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) in several cell types . Functionality of the endothelial P00374 , however , remains completely unknown . Here we present findings that specific inhibition of endothelial P00374 by RNA interference markedly reduced endothelial H4B and nitric oxide ( NO. ) bioavailability . Furthermore , angiotensin II ( 100 nmol/liter for 24 h ) caused a H4B deficiency that was mediated by H2O2-dependent down-regulation of P00374 . This response was associated with a significant increase in endothelial O2*- production , which was abolished by P29474 inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester or H2O2 scavenger polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase , strongly suggesting H2O2-dependent P29474 uncoupling . Rapid and transient activation of endothelial NAD(P)H oxidases was responsible for the initial burst production of O2* ( Rac1 inhibitor NSC 23766 but not an N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester-attenuated P03372 O2*- signal at 30 min ) in response to angiotensin II , preceding a second peak in O2*- production at 24 h that predominantly depended on uncoupled P29474 . Overexpression of P00374 restored NO. production and diminished P29474 production of O2*- in angiotensin II-stimulated cells . In conclusion , these data represent evidence that P00374 is critical for H4B and NO. bioavailability in the endothelium . Endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase-derived H2O2 down-regulates P00374 expression in response to angiotensin II , resulting in H4B deficiency and uncoupling of P29474 . This signaling cascade may represent a universal mechanism underlying P29474 dysfunction under pathophysiological conditions associated with oxidant stress . Pharmacophore-based virtual screening versus docking-based virtual screening : a benchmark comparison against eight targets . AIM : This study was conducted to compare the efficiencies of two virtual screening approaches , pharmacophore-based virtual screening ( PBVS ) and docking-based virtual screening ( DBVS ) methods . METHODS : All virtual screens were performed on two data sets of small molecules with both actives and decoys against eight structurally diverse protein targets , namely angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) , acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , androgen receptor ( AR ) , D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase ( DacA ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , estrogen receptors alpha ( ERalpha ) , HIV-1 protease ( HIV-pr ) , and thymidine kinase ( TK ) . Each pharmacophore model was constructed based on several X-ray structures of protein-ligand complexes . Virtual screens were performed using four screening standards , the program Catalyst for PBVS and three docking programs ( DOCK , GOLD and Glide ) for DBVS . RESULTS : Of the sixteen sets of virtual screens ( one target versus two testing databases ) , the enrichment factors of fourteen cases using the PBVS method were higher than those using DBVS methods . The average hit rates over the eight targets at 2 % and 5 % of the highest ranks of the entire databases for PBVS are much higher than those for DBVS . CONCLUSION : The PBVS method outperformed DBVS methods in retrieving actives from the databases in our tested targets , and is a powerful method in drug discovery . Thymopentin down-regulates both activity and expression of P35228 in blood cells of Sézary syndrome patients . While thymopentin has been used for many years in the experimental treatment of Sézary syndrome ( SS ) , a rare and very aggressive lymphoma , its mechanism of action is still not known . Herein we show that this peptide acts as an inhibitor of isolated P35228 and P29475 isoforms , and reduces P35228 protein/mRNA levels and P35228 activity in blood cells obtained from both healthy donors and SS patients . Similar results were obtained with O15533 -2 , the N(ω)-nitro analogue of the DB00125 -Lys motif present in thymopentin . Additional investigations are necessary to confirm the role and the relative importance of the two mechanisms of P35228 down-regulation in the therapeutic action of these peptides against SS . Intracellular disposition of methotrexate in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children . DB00563 ( MTX ) is a key agent for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and the benefit of high-dose MTX is well established as it significantly increases cure rates and improves patients ' prognosis . However , the determinants of MTX therapeutic effect are not clearly identified , although intracellular polyglutamation is essential . MTX , the monoglutamate form ( MTXG₁ ) inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) implicated in the folate cycle . MTXG₁ is metabolized to active methotrexate polyglutamates ( MTXPG ) with sequential gamma-linkage of 2 to 6 glutamyl residues by the folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( Q05932 ) . Long chain MTXPG have higher affinity than MTX for the enzymes involved in de novo purine synthesis such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase ( P31939 ) and thymidilate synthase ( TS ) , which results in a reinforcement of MTX inhibition . Thus , intracellular formation of MTXPG enhances the cytotoxic and antileukemic effect of MTX . Different pharmacogenetic polymorphisms contribute to interindividual variability in MTX response to treatment . In addition , pharmacokinetic interactions with 6-mercaptopurine ( DB01033 ) , frequently co-administered , have been reported . And factors affecting intracellular MTX disposition and DB01033 /MTX interactions , including pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting MTX disposition are reviewed . Nearly Complete Response of Brain Metastases from P04626 Overexpressing Breast Cancer with DB01259 and DB01101 after Whole Brain Irradiation . DB00072 treatment does not prevent intracranial seeding and is largely ineffective for established central nervous system metastasis in P04626 overexpressing breast cancer patients . Combination therapy of lapatinib and capecitabine may be an effective treatment option for brain metastasis of P04626 -positive breast cancer . We report a patient with breast cancer overexpressing HER-2 where brain metastases were successfully treated with radiation and a combination of lapatinib and capecitabine . Q9UBP4 maintains the PANC-1 human pancreatic tumor cells in a dedifferentiated state . Pancreatic cancer ( PaCa ) is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in Western societies , with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas ( PDACs ) accounting for > 90 % of such cases . PDAC is a heterogeneous disease that includes a subset showing overexpression of the secreted glycoprotein Q9UBP4 ( Q9UBP4 ) , a protein shown to be downregulated in various cancers of different tissues . The biological function of Q9UBP4 in this subset was studied using the Q9UBP4 expressing PANC-1 cell line as a model for PDACs . The influence of Q9UBP4 overexpression and knockdown on cellular differentiation and proliferation of PANC-1 was investigated . Confocal microscopy showed that Q9UBP4 was expressed in a fraction of PANC-1 cells . While lentiviral-mediated overexpression of Q9UBP4 did not alter cellular proliferation , knockdown of Q9UBP4 resulted in significant reduction of cellular proliferation and concomitant induction of cell cycle inhibitors P42772 ( p15INK4b ) , P38936 ( p21CIP1 ) and P46527 ( p27KIP1 ) . In parallel , pancreatic epithelial cell differentiation markers P04746 , Q9UNI1 , P17538 , P01275 , P16278 and P01308 were significantly upregulated . PANC-1 cells differentiated using exendin-4 showed analogous induction of cell cycle inhibitors and differentiation markers . Thus , we conclude that Q9UBP4 is required to maintain a highly dedifferentiated and consequently proliferative state in PANC-1 , indicating a similar function in the Q9UBP4 overexpressing subset of PDACs . Therefore , Q9UBP4 represents a potential target for the treatment of Q9UBP4 -positive subtypes of PaCa to drive cells into cell cycle arrest and differentiation . Cloning and initial characterization of a new subunit for mammalian serine-palmitoyltransferase . DB00133 -palmitoyltransferase ( P21549 ) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids . P21549 is considered to be a heterodimer composed of two subunits , O15269 and O15270 . Here we report the identification of a novel , third , P21549 subunit ( Q9NUV7 ) that shows 68 % homology to the O15270 subunit . Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Q9NUV7 expression is highly variable between different human tissues and cell lines . The highest expression was observed in placenta tissue and human trophoblast cell lines . The overexpression of Q9NUV7 in Hek293 cells , which otherwise have very little endogenous Q9NUV7 , led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in cellular P21549 activity . Silencing of Q9NUV7 expression in HepG2 cells or human trophoblast cells by transfecting Q9NUV7 -specific siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of cellular P21549 activity . The expression of two P21549 isoforms could be a cellular mechanism to adjust P21549 activity to tissue-specific requirements of sphingolipid synthesis . Requirement of methotrexate in combination with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy for adequate suppression of osteoclastogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis . OBJECTIVE : To determine that concomitant use of methotrexate ( MTX ) is required to achieve adequate suppression of bone destruction in treating rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) with tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) -inhibiting biologic therapy . We quantitatively compared the suppressive effects of treatment with a combination of infliximab and MTX and treatment with each of these 2 agents alone on bone destruction in SCID-HuRAg-pit mice . METHODS : Tissue derived from human RA pannus was implanted with a slice of dentin subcutaneously in the backs of SCID mice ( SCID-HuRAg-pit model ) . DB00065 was administered daily to SCID-HuRAg-pit mice using an osmotic pump for 2 weeks with or without oral administration of MTX . Histological changes in tissue and the pits formed on the dentin slice were examined 8 weeks after transplant . Serum concentrations of P01375 and interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) were also measured . RESULTS : Treatment with a combination of infliximab and MTX suppressed pit formation significantly , while treatment with neither infliximab alone nor MTX alone had a significant effect on pit formation . Synovial inflammation and serum P01375 and P05231 levels were suppressed by infliximab with or without MTX . CONCLUSION : This is the first evidence in an animal model of arthritis that concomitant use of MTX is required to achieve adequate suppression of bone destruction when treating RA with a P01375 -inhibiting biologic . Our findings suggest that infliximab suppresses bone destruction through a mechanism of action different from that mediating its antiinflammatory effects in the treatment of RA . P01308 -like growth factor-1 receptor inhibitor , Q99217 -479 , in cetuximab-refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma . BACKGROUND : Recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) remains a difficult cancer to treat . Here , we describe a patient with HNSCC who had complete response to methotrexate ( MTX ) after progressing on multiple cytotoxic agents , cetuximab , and Q99217 -479 ( monoclonal antibody against insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor [ IGF-1R ] ) . METHODS : The clinical information was collected by a retrospective medical record review under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol . From 4 tumors and 2 normal mucosal epithelia , global gene expression , and IGF-1R and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) protein levels were determined . RESULTS : Effective target inhibition in the tumor was confirmed by the decreased protein levels of total and phospho-IGF-1R after treatment with Q99217 -479 . Decreased level of P00374 and conversion of a gene expression profile associated with cetuximab-resistance to cetuximab-sensitivity were also observed . CONCLUSION : This suggests that the combination of Q99217 -479 and MTX or cetuximab may be a promising therapeutic approach in refractory HNSCC . Genetic variation modifies risk for neurodegeneration based on biomarker status . BACKGROUND : While a great deal of work has gone into understanding the relationship between Cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) biomarkers , brain atrophy , and disease progression , less work has attempted to investigate how genetic variation modifies these relationships . The goal of this study was two-fold . First , we sought to identify high-risk vs. low-risk individuals based on their P04141 tau and Aβ load and characterize these individuals with regard to brain atrophy in an AD-relevant region of interest . Next , we sought to identify genetic variants that modified the relationship between biomarker classification and neurodegeneration . METHODS : Participants were categorized based on established cut-points for biomarker positivity . Mixed model regression was used to quantify longitudinal change in the left inferior lateral ventricle . Interaction analyses between single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and biomarker group status were performed using a genome wide association study ( GWAS ) approach . Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the Bonferroni procedure . RESULTS : One intergenic SNP ( rs4866650 ) and one SNP within the O15269 gene ( rs7849530 ) modified the association between amyloid positivity and neurodegeneration . A transcript variant of WDR11-AS1 gene ( rs12261764 ) modified the association between tau positivity and neurodegeneration . These effects were consistent across the two sub-datasets and explained approximately 3 % of variance in ventricular dilation . One additional SNP ( rs6887649 ) modified the association between amyloid positivity and baseline ventricular volume , but was not observed consistently across the sub-datasets . CONCLUSIONS : Genetic variation modifies the association between AD biomarkers and neurodegeneration . Genes that regulate the molecular response in the brain to oxidative stress may be particularly relevant to neural vulnerability to the damaging effects of amyloid-β . Identification of an antigenic determinant on the S2 domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies . Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( P49591 ) is a life-threatening disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus ( CoV ) , P49591 -CoV . The spike ( S ) glycoprotein of CoV is the major structural protein responsible for induction of host immune response and virus neutralization by antibodies . Hence , knowledge of neutralization determinants on the Q15517 is helpful for designing protective vaccines . To analyze the antigenic structure of the P49591 -CoV S2 domain , the carboxyl-terminal half of the Q15517 , we first used sera from convalescent P49591 patients to test the antigenicity of 12 overlapping fragments spanning the entire S2 and identified two antigenic determinants ( DB00149 803 to Ala 828 and Pro 1061 to DB00133 1093 ) . To determine whether neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by these two determinants , we immunized animals and found that both of them could induce the S2-specific antisera . In some animals , however , only one determinant ( DB00149 803 to Ala 828 ) was able to induce the antisera with the binding ability to the native Q15517 and the neutralizing activity to the P49591 -CoV pseudovirus . This determinant is highly conserved across different P49591 -CoV isolates . Identification of a conserved antigenic determinant on the S2 domain of the P49591 -CoV Q15517 , which has the potential for inducing neutralizing antibodies , has implications in the development of effective vaccines against P49591 -CoV . Proteomic analysis for the identification of proteins related to methotrexate resistance . DB00563 (MTX) is one of the most important and frequently used drugs in cancer therapy , but the efficacy of this drug is often compromised by the development of resistance in cancer cells . To seek and identify differentially expressed proteins related to MTX resistance and provide clues for the mechanism of MTX resistance , proteins from cell line MTX300 ( resistant to 300 micromol/L MTX ) and its control cell line 3T3R500 were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis ( 2-DE ) . The colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue-stained 2-DE gels were subjected to image analysis , which revealed several spots with high levels of differential expression between MTX300 and 3T3R500 . The protein spot with highest differential expression was submitted for tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting(PMF) for identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF-MS ) . MS analysis and database searches revealed it to be dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , which was subsequently confirmed by Western blot . The result suggested that P00374 might play an important role in the MTX resistance . Order of genes on human chromosome 5q with respect to 5q interstitial deletions . Using ( a ) somatic cell hybrids retaining partial chromosome 5 and ( b ) clinical samples from patients with acquired deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 , combined with chromosome 5-linked DNA probes , some of which exhibited RFLPs , we have determined the order of a series of genes on chromosome 5 . The order established is 5pter ---- MLVI-2 ---- cen ---- P07686 ---- P00374 ---- Pi227- --- cp12.6 ---- ( P05113 , P05112 ) ---- P08700 ---- P04141 ---- P05230 ---- ( P07333 , P09619 ) ---- ( treC,ADRBR ) ---- ( Q5SW96 - Q13585 , P09603 ) ---- qter . The suggested order and orientation for the closely linked P08700 / P04141 gene pair is cen ---- 5' P08700 3' ---- 5' P04141 3' ---- qter , on the basis of analysis of the P04141 rearrangement in HL60 DNA . The map position of the GRL locus , which was consistent with both somatic cell hybrid and 5q- analyses , was telomeric to P04141 and centromeric to P07333 / P09619 , near P05230 . Long-range restriction-enzyme analysis of 5q- DNAs did not detect rearrangements of 5q-linked probes except in HL60 DNA , but it did reveal putative long-range RFLPs of several loci . RFLPs for GRL , Pi227 , cp12.6 , P08700 , and P07333 can detect deletions in bone marrow and in leukemia cells from patients with acquired 5q deletions . DB00563 induces apoptosis through p53/ P38936 -dependent pathway and increases P12830 expression through downregulation of HDAC/ Q15910 . DB00563 ( MTX ) is a dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitor widely used as an anticancer drug in different kinds of human cancers . Here we investigated the anti-tumor mechanism of MTX against non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) A549 cells . MTX not only inhibited in vitro cell growth via induction of apoptosis , but also inhibited tumor formation in animal xenograft model . RNase protection assay ( RPA ) and RT-PCR demonstrated its induction of p53 target genes including DR5 , P38936 , Puma and Noxa . Moreover , MTX promoted p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and acetylaion at Lys373/382 , which increase its stability and expression . The apoptosis and inhibition of cell viability induced by MTX were dependent on p53 and , partially , on P38936 . In addition , MTX also increased P12830 expression through inhibition of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) activity and downregulation of polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2 ( Q15910 ) . Therefore , the anticancer mechanism of MTX acts through initiation of p53-dependent apoptosis and restoration of P12830 expression by downregulation of HDAC/ Q15910 . In vitro and in vivo biological activities of a novel nonpolyglutamable anti-folate , MX-68 . MX-68 is a newly synthesized anti-folate , chemically designed not to undergo intracellular polyglutamation and to have increased affinity to dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . In the present study , we examined the in vitro and in vivo biological activities of MX-68 compared with methotrexate ( MTX ) which forms several polyglutamates intracellularly . MX-68 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of PHA- , anti-CD3- , or PMA plus ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and endothelial cells ( EC ) from normal subjects as well as P01584 - or P01375 alpha-stimulated synovial fibroblastic cells ( SC ) from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients . Coaddition of folinic acid completely reversed the anti-proliferative effects of both MX-68 and MTX . Although the anti-proliferative activities of MX-68 were almost comparable to those of MTX , the washout study clearly showed the characteristic nature of MX-68 . When drugs were removed during culture , the suppressive effect of MX-68 completely disappeared , whereas suppression by MTX was merely weakened . MX-68 dramatically suppressed the onset of collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) in mice when the drug was orally administered three times a week. starting from the day of first immunization . In this model , 2 mg/kg of MX-68 was sufficient to completely suppress arthritis , whereas suppression by the same dose of MTX was partial . These lines of evidence suggest that polyglutamation is not always a prerequisite in the anti-rheumatic effects of anti-folate . In addition , since intracellular accumulation of polyglutamates is thought to have adverse effects , MX-68 may become a more potent and less toxic anti-rheumatic drug than MTX . aChE and BuChE inhibition by rivastigmin have no effect on peripheral insulin resistance in elderly patients with Alzheimer disease . BACKGROUND : P01308 resistance ( IR ) may play a role in most pathogenic processes that promote the development of Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ( LOAD ) . This study was designed to determine the interaction between inhibition of both butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) and acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) with rivastigmine and peripheral insulin resistance ( IR ) in LOAD . METHODS : Seventy-Nine consecutive elderly patients , 31 late onset AD and 48 non-demented patients were evaluated . IR was calculated with HOMA . All of the patients were evaluated through comprehensive geriatric assessments at baseline and in the 6th and 12th months . RESULTS : End of the study , compared to the baseline values , there was a significant increase in the 6th month in both MMSE and IADL scores ( t =2.200 , p = 0.036 for MMSE and t =2.724 , p= 0.011 for IADL , respectively ) . DB00989 was improved both the scores of MMSE and IADL in elderly patients with LOAD , but there was no significance or correlation between HOMA scores and cognitive status . CONCLUSION : In conclusion , inhibition of both BuChE and P22303 with rivastigmine was improved the cognition without affecting on the peripheral IR in the elderly patients with LOAD by HOMA . Due to the complexity of disease pathogenesis , it is too early to make general comments , and further longitudinal and long-term studies on this issue are needed . DB00563 in rheumatoid arthritis : studies with animal models . The present studies have shown that low doses of methotrexate can suppress the inflammation and joint destruction associated with animal models of arthritis . The antiinflammatory effects of methotrexate are probably related to its inhibitory effect on chemotaxis . At the low doses used , methotrexate does not induce systemic immunosuppression . In methotrexate-treated rats , an improvement in P60568 synthesis is observed and increases in P60568 levels are expected to improve cell mediated immunity . Suppressor cells appear to be very sensitive to methotrexate . Macrophage function is modulated by methotrexate . All of these effects including the effects on joint destruction are probably due to inhibition of P00374 activity of critical cells that are involved in the pathogenesis of rat arthritis induced either by adjuvant or by streptococcal cell walls . Some of these effects have been extended to human arthritis but additional studies are required to understand how low dose methotrexate exerts its beneficial effects in humans . Synteny mapping in the bovine : genes from human chromosome 4 . Genes homologous to those located on human chromosome 4 ( HSA4 ) were mapped in the bovine to determine regions of syntenic conservation among humans , mice , and cattle . Previous studies have shown that two homologs of genes on HSA4 , Q96G03 and P28838 , are located in bovine syntenic group U15 ( chromosome 6 ) . The homologous mouse genes , Pgm-1 and Pep-7 , are on MMU5 . Using a panel of bovine x hamster hybrid somatic cells , we have assigned homologs of 11 additional HSA4 loci to their respective bovine syntenic groups . D4S43 , D4S10 , P09417 , P01591 , P00325 , P10721 , and IF were assigned to syntenic group U15 . This syntenic arrangement is not conserved in the mouse , where D4s43 , D4s10 , Qdpr , and Igj are on MMU5 while Adh-2 is on MMU3 . P60568 , P02675 , P02679 , and P03951 , which also reside on MMU3 , were assigned to bovine syntenic group U23 . These data suggest that breaks and/or fusions of ancestral chromosomes carrying these genes occurred at different places during the evolution of humans , cattle , and mice . The mode of action of methotrexate-monoclonal antibody conjugates . Drug-monoclonal antibody conjugates have been evaluated for their specificity and toxicity towards tumour cells in vitro and in vivo ; however , few studies have investigated their mode of entry into cells and mechanism of action . In this study the uptake and toxic effect of three different DB00563 -monoclonal antibody ( MTX-MoAb ) conjugates ( MTX-anti-transferrin receptor ( TFR ) , MTX-anti-Ly-2.1 and MTX-anti-L3T4 ) were examined and compared with free MTX . It was concluded that MTX and these MTX-MoAb conjugates gain entry into tumour cells and are processed by different mechanisms , considering the following results : alterations in temperature had a greater effect on the toxicity of MTX-MoAb than on MTX ; in addition , MTX and MTX-MoAb had different rates of action on cells ; the specific MTX transport inhibitor , p-chloromercuribenzene sulphonate ( pCMS ) , reduced MTX toxicity but had no effect on specific MTX-MoAb conjugates ; the concentration of various ions ( Ca2+ , Mg2+ and Mn2+ ) effected the entry of MTX-MoAb but had no effect on free MTX . MTX enters by its own carrier mechanism , while MTX-MoAb conjugates enter by endocytosis with release of MTX at the lysosomal membrane , demonstrated by the ability of chloroquine and NH4Cl ( which inhibit lysosomal function ) to inhibit the action of MTX-MoAb but not MTX . Therefore , these MTX-MoAb conjugates are not degraded at the surface but bind to their receptor and then enter the cell by endocytosis as one entity ; the MTX-MoAb conjugates are then degraded within the lysosomes , resulting in the release of free MTX into the cytoplasm where it acts on dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) to inhibit cell metabolism . Endothelial dysfunction in congestive heart failure : P12821 inhibition vs. angiotensin II antagonism . BACKGROUND : Endothelial dysfunction of the vasculature contributes to the elevated peripheral resistance and reduced myocardial perfusion in congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . The present study systematically investigated the effect of angiotensin II ( AT(1) ) - receptor blockade on vascular superoxide ( O(2)(-) ) production and endothelial dysfunction . METHODS AND RESULTS : Vasodilator responses and O(2)(-) production were determined in aortic rings from Wistar rats with experimental CHF 10 weeks after extensive myocardial infarction and compared with sham-operated animals ( Sham ) . Rats were either treated with placebo ( P ) , with the AT(1)-receptor antagonist Irbesartan ( 50 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) or with the P12821 inhibitor DB00519 ( 0.3 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) . In CHF-P , endothelium-dependent , acetylcholine-induced relaxation was significantly attenuated compared with Sham-P . Chronic treatment with DB00519 or Irbesartan significantly improved endothelium-dependent relaxation . Aortic O(2)(-) formation was markedly increased in CHF , and was not significantly affected by DB00519 treatment , while it was reduced by Irbesartan. P29474 expression was reduced in CHF and normalised by both treatments . CONCLUSION : Endothelial vasomotor function in CHF rats was normalised by long-term treatment with an P12821 inhibitor or an AT(1)-antagonist . Reduced aortic P29474 expression was normalised by both treatments , whereas aortic superoxide formation was only reduced by the AT(1)-antagonist Irbesartan . DB04630 / P08235 stimulation induces cellular senescence in the kidney . Recent studies demonstrated a possible role of aldosterone in mediating cell senescence . Thus , the aim of this study was to investigate whether aldosterone induces cell senescence in the kidney and whether aldosterone-induced renal senescence affects the development of renal injury . DB04630 infusion ( 0.75 μg/h ) into rats for 5 weeks caused hypertension and increased urinary excretion rates of proteins and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase . DB04630 induced senescence-like changes in the kidney , exhibited by increased expression of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase , overexpression of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( P38936 ) , and decreased expression of Q96EB6 . These changes were abolished by eplerenone ( 100 mg/kg/d ) , a mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) antagonist , but unaffected by hydralazine ( 80 mg/liter in drinking water ) . Furthermore , aldosterone induced similar changes in senescence-associated β-galactosidase , P38936 , and Q96EB6 expression in cultured human proximal tubular cells , which were normalized by an antioxidant , N-acetyl L-cysteine , or gene silencing of MR . DB04630 significantly delayed wound healing and reduced the number of proliferating human proximal tubular cells , while gene silencing of P38936 diminished the effects , suggesting impaired recovery from tubular damage . These findings indicate that aldosterone induces renal senescence in proximal tubular cells via the MR and P38936 -dependent pathway , which may be involved in aldosterone-induced renal injury . Genetic polymorphism and activities of human lung alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases : implications for ethanol metabolism and cytotoxicity . DB00898 dehydrogenase ( DB00067 ) and aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) exhibit genetic polymorphism and tissue specificity . DB00067 and ALDH isozyme phenotypes from 39 surgical Chinese lung specimens were identified by agarose isoelectric focusing . The identity of the lung beta-ADHs was further demonstrated by their characteristic pH-activity profiles for ethanol oxidation , Km values for NAD and ethanol , and inhibition by DB01213 or 1,10-phenanthroline . The beta 2 allele , coding for beta 2 polypeptide , was found to be predominant in the lung specimens studied . The DB00067 activities in the lungs with the homozygous phenotype P00325 2-2 ( exhibiting beta 2 beta 2 ) and P00325 1-1 ( exhibiting beta 1 beta 1 ) and the heterozygous phenotype P00325 P35326 ( exhibiting beta 2 beta 2 , beta 2 beta 1 , and beta 1 beta 1 ) were determined to be 999 +/- 77 , 48 +/- 17 , and 494 +/- 61 nmol/min/g tissue , respectively . Fifty-one percent of the specimens studied lacked the P05091 activity band on the isoelectric focusing gels . The activities in the lung tissues with the P05091 -active phenotype and the inactive phenotype were determined to be 30 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 1 nmol/min/g tissue , respectively . These findings indicate that human pulmonary ethanol-metabolizing activities differ significantly with respect to genetic polymorphism at both the P00325 and the P05091 loci . The results suggest that individuals with high Vmax beta 2- DB00067 and deficient in low-Km mitochondrial P05091 , accounting for approximately 45 % of the Chinese population , may end up with acetaldehyde accumulation during alcohol consumption , rendering them vulnerable to tissue injury caused by this highly reactive and toxic metabolite . Role of the chaperonin cofactor P61604 in protein folding and sorting in yeast mitochondria . Protein folding in mitochondria is mediated by the chaperonin P10809 , the homologue of E. coli GroEL . Mitochondria also contain a homologue of the cochaperonin GroES , called P61604 , which is a functional regulator of the chaperonin . To define the in vivo role of the co-chaperonin , we have used the genetic and biochemical potential of the yeast S. cerevisiae . The HSP10 gene was cloned and sequenced and temperature-sensitive lethal hsp10 mutants were generated . Our results identify P61604 as an essential component of the mitochondrial protein folding apparatus , participating in various aspects of P10809 function . P61604 is required for the folding and assembly of proteins imported into the matrix compartment , and is involved in the sorting of certain proteins , such as the Rieske DB01592 / Q15517 , passing through the matrix en route to the intermembrane space . The folding of the precursor of cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , imported into mitochondria as a fusion protein , is apparently independent of P61604 function consistent with observations made for the chaperonin-mediated folding of P00374 in vitro . The temperature-sensitive mutations in P61604 map to a domain ( residues 25-40 ) that corresponds to a previously identified mobile loop region of bacterial GroES and result in a reduced binding affinity of hsp10 for the chaperonin at the non-permissive temperature . Oxidation of alcohols and reduction of aldehydes derived from methyl- and dimethylpyrenes by cDNA-expressed human alcohol dehydrogenases . Some methylated pyrenes can form DNA adducts in rat tissues after benzylic hydroxylation and sulpho conjugation . However , oxidation of the intermediate alcohols to carboxylic acids is an important competing pathway leading to detoxification . We previously showed that co-administration of ethanol or DB01213 strongly enhances DNA adduct formation by 1-hydroxymethylpyrene , indicating an involvement of alcohol dehydrogenases ( ADHs ) in the detoxification . This mechanism may be involved in the observed synergism of smoking and alcohol consumption in certain human cancers . In a preceding study , cDNA-expressed human P00325 efficiently oxidised 1- , 2- and 4-hydroxymethylpyrene ; these reactions were inhibited in the presence of ethanol or DB01213 . Here we report that P00326 , P00326 and P08319 also show substantial activity towards these substrates and two further congeners , 1-hydroxymethyl-6-methylpyrene and 1-hydroxymethyl-8-methylpyrene . All four DB00067 forms also catalysed the reverse reaction , implying that the aldehydes have to be sequestered by other enzymes , such as aldehyde dehydrogenases , for final detoxification . P00326 and P08319 activities towards hydroxymethylpyrenes were more strongly inhibited in the presence of ethanol and DB01213 than those of P00325 . P00326 was only inhibited at very high concentrations of the modulators . In conclusions , several human ADHs are capable of detoxifying benzylic alcohols of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . However , some competing substrates and inhibitors may affect all these redundant detoxification systems , although to various extents . Role of arginine in superficial wound healing in man . DB00125 supplementation has been identified as advantageous in experimental wound healing . However , the mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect in tissue repair remain unresolved . Animal studies suggest that the beneficial role of arginine supplementation is mediated , at least in part through NO . The latter component mediates processes involved in tissue repair , including angiogenesis , epithelialization and collagen formation . This prospective study is performed to investigate arginine metabolism in acute surgical wounds in man . Expression of enzymes , known to be involved in arginine metabolism , was studied in donor sites of skin grafts of 10 hospitalized patients undergoing skin transplantation . Plasma and wound fluid levels of arginine metabolites ( ornithine , citrulline , nitrate and nitrite = NOx ) were measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography . Expression of P35228 , P29474 , arginase-1 and arginase-2 was studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of skin tissue . P05089 concentration was measured in plasma and wound fluid using ELISA . Arginase-2 was determined using Western blot analysis . We observed increased levels of citrulline , ornithine , NOx and arginase-1 in wound fluid when compared with plasma . Arginase-2 was expressed in both plasma and wound fluid and seemed higher in plasma . P35228 was expressed by neutrophils , macrophages , fibroblasts , keratinocytes and endothelial cells upon wounding , whereas P29474 reactivity was observed in endothelial cells and fibroblasts . P05089 was expressed in neutrophils post-wounding , while arginase-2 staining was observed in endothelial cells , keratinocytes , fibroblasts , macrophages and neutrophils . For the first time , human data support previous animal studies suggesting arginine metabolism for an NO- as well as arginase-mediated reparation of injured skin . P01375 -α-mediated cardiorenal injury after rhabdomyolysis in rats . The P01375 -α serum level increases after rhabdomyolysis and is involved in the subsequent cardiorenal injury . In the present study , we investigated the P01375 -α-dependent cell signaling pathways implicated in cellular injury in these organs . Rhabdomyolysis was induced by intramuscular glycerol injection in rats . Renal function , cardiac and renal pathology , and activation of caspases were evaluated during the first 24 h after glycerol injection . P01375 -α blockade with infliximab reduced tubular necrosis and cardiorenal apoptosis . Cellular Fas-associated protein with death domain-like IL-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein ( cFLIP ) , an inhibitor of caspase-8 , was overexpressed in the kidney but not in the heart . The inhibitory effect of cFLIP blunted caspase-8 activation in the kidney . In this condition , the cellular response to the P01375 -α stimulus was driven to receptor-interacting protein-1 ( Q13546 ) -mediated necroptosis . Treatment with Q13546 inhibitor ( necrostatin-1 ) isolated or in combination with infliximab showed a similar reduction in tubular necrosis , underscoring the importance of P01375 -α-mediated tubular necroptosis in this model . P01375 -α played a positive regulatory role in the transcription of proapoptotic Bax and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis ( PUMA ) proteins . DB00065 treatment reduced caspase-9-mediated apoptosis in both organs . Treatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor showed that caspase-8 participated in the process of apoptosis only in the heart , upstream of caspase-9 activation . P01375 -α-mediated necroptosis is the predominant form of tubular injury observed in the glycerol model . P01375 -α up regulates Bax and PUMA proapoptotic proteins , resulting in activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in the kidney and heart . Flow cytometric analysis of mammalian glial cultures treated with methotrexate . DB00563 ( MTX ) is an antineoplastic drug that acts by competitive inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . MTX treatment of cultured cell lines leads to the emergence of resistant cell populations . Studies using stepwise selection procedures have demonstrated that MTX resistance conferred by overproduction of P00374 can be caused by P00374 gene amplification . We examined the effect of MTX on cells whose origin more closely approximates the in vivo condition by developing a culture system using dissociated brain tissue from 17-19 day old mouse embryos . At the first passage , cultures were divided into control and MTX groups . Cells were treated with the same or successively higher concentrations of MTX at each passage over a 3-4 month period . The first passage eliminated neurons and left a glial culture comprised of approximately 90 % astrocytes . We used the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter in conjunction with fluorescent dyes to measure P00374 content , DNA content , size , and viability of glial cells following MTX treatment . MTX-treated cells divided but grew more slowly and were larger than untreated cells . Stepwise selection in 30/60/90 nM or 60/120 nM MTX resulted in significant two- to threefold increases in fluorescence , and hence P00374 levels . Slot hybridizations assays demonstrated a threefold increase in P00374 gene copy number in the DNA from the 30/60/90 cultures . Thus , our findings were consistent with the results obtained from somatic cell lines , and lend support to the hypothesis that gene amplification may be a common mechanism for the acquisition of resistance in many types of cells . They also indicate that glial cells may be a specific target for cytotoxic effects of MTX on the central nervous system . Circulating cytokines and risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma : a prospective study . Cytokines play important roles in B-cell activation , proliferation , and apoptosis , thus may be etiologically related to risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( B- Q9NZ71 ) . However , the association between circulating levels of cytokines and B- Q9NZ71 risk has not been prospectively studied in non-HIV populations . The objective of this study was to assess this association by conducting a case-control study nested within a prospective cohort of non-HIV-infected , healthy women . Fifteen cytokines were measured in samples collected a median of 8.2 years prior to diagnosis in 92 cases and two matched controls per case . Only cytokines that showed adequate temporal reproducibility over a two-year period were included . The odds ratio ( OR ) for the highest tertile relative to the lowest was elevated for soluble P60568 receptor ( sIL-2R ) ( OR = 2.5 , 95 % CI = 1.4-4.7 , p ( trend ) < 0.01 ) and decreased for P35225 ( OR = 0.5 , 95 % CI = 0. P35326 .0 , p ( trend ) = 0.05 ) . Three other cytokines were marginally associated with risk of B- Q9NZ71 : P01375 ( OR = 1.7 , 95 % CI = 0.9-3.3 , p ( trend ) = 0.11 ) , sTNF-R2 ( OR = 1.9 , 95 % CI = 0.9-3.5 , p ( trend ) = 0.06 ) , and P05113 ( OR = 0.5 , 95 % CI = 0.3-1.0 , p ( trend ) = 0.06 ) . No association was observed between B- Q9NZ71 risk and levels of the other cytokines measured ( IL-1beta , IL-1RA , P60568 , P05112 , P05231 , P22301 , IL-12 , IL-12p70 , CRP and sTNF- Q96GN5 ) . This study suggests that dysregulated cytokines may be involved in B- Q9NZ71 development . Pre-clinical evaluation of an in vitro selection protocol for the enrichment of transduced P28906 + cell-derived human dendritic cells . The efficient genetic modification of P28906 + cell-derived dendritic cells ( DC ) will provide a significant advancement towards the development of immunotherapy protocols for cancer , autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases . Recent reports have described the transduction of P28906 + cells via retrovirus- and lentivirus-based gene transfer vectors and subsequent differentiation into functional DC . Since there is significant apprehension regarding the clinical uses of HIV-based vectors , in this report , we compare a murine leukemia virus ( MLV ) - and a human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -based bicistronic vector for gene transfer into human P28906 + cells and subsequent differentiation into mature DC . Each vector expressed both EGFP and the dominant selectable marker P00374 (L22Y) allowing for the enrichment of marked cells in the presence of the antifolate drug trimetrexate ( TMTX ) . Both MLV-based and HIV-based vectors efficiently transduced cytokine mobilized human peripheral blood P28906 + cells . However , in vitro expansion and differentiation in the presence of GM- P04141 , P01375 , Flt-3L , P21583 and P05112 resulted in a reduction in the percentage of DC expressing the transgene . Selection with TMTX during differentiation increased the percentage of marked DC , resulting in up to 79 % ( MLV vector ) and up to 94 % ( lentivirus-vector ) transduced cells expressing EGFP without loss of DC phenotype . Thus , MLV-based vectors and in vitro selection of transduced human DC show great promise for immunotherapy protocols . Temporal profiling of lapatinib-suppressed phosphorylation signals in P00533 / P04626 pathways . DB01259 is a clinically potent kinase inhibitor for breast cancer patients because of its outstanding selectivity for epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and EGFR2 ( also known as P04626 ) . However , there is only limited information about the in vivo effects of lapatinib on P00533 / P04626 and downstream signaling targets . Here , we profiled the lapatinib-induced time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation dynamics in SKBR3 breast cancer cells by means of quantitative phosphoproteomics . Among 4953 identified phosphopeptides from 1548 proteins , a small proportion ( 5-7 % ) was regulated at least twofold by 1-10 μm lapatinib . We obtained a comprehensive phosphorylation map of 21 sites on P00533 / P04626 , including nine novel sites on P04626 . Among them , serine/threonine phosphosites located in a small region of P04626 ( amino acid residues 1049-1083 ) were up-regulated by the drug , whereas all other sites were down-regulated . We show that DB02527 -dependent protein kinase is involved in phosphorylation of this particular region of P04626 and regulates P04626 tyrosine kinase activity . Computational analyses of quantitative phosphoproteome data indicated for the first time that protein-protein networks related to cytoskeletal organization and transcriptional/translational regulation , such as Q96LT9 complexes ( i.e. hnRNP , snRNP , telomerase , ribosome ) , are linked to P00533 / P04626 signaling networks . To our knowledge , this is the first report to profile the temporal response of phosphorylation dynamics to a kinase inhibitor . The results provide new insights into P00533 / P04626 regulation through region-specific phosphorylation , as well as a global view of the cellular signaling networks associated with the anti-breast cancer action of lapatinib . Modulation of a Mr 175,000 c-neu receptor isoform in Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells by serum starvation . The neu proto-oncogene product has been found to exist in two interconvertible forms in Q9UBA6 / P00374 mouse fibroblasts . The 185-kilodalton form ( p185 ) present in growing cells is replaced by a 175-kilodalton form ( p175 ) under conditions of serum starvation . This low molecular weight form accounts almost exclusively for the phosphotyrosine content of the receptor and is associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity . Addition of serum , platelet-derived growth factor or tumor promoter induces conversion of p175 to p185 within minutes , and this increase in molecular weight is associated with phosphorylation of serine and threonine ; removal of serum growth factors is followed by replacement of p185 with p175 over several hours . Unlike Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells , the human breast cancer cell line SK-Br-3 expresses a high molecular weight neu/ P04626 receptor with unchanged phosphotyrosine content in both serum-starved and serum-stimulated cultures . These findings indicate that activation of the neu proto-oncogene product in Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells may be regulated in part by protein kinase C-mediated receptor transmodulation rather than by ligand availability alone . Expression Enhancement in DB00072 Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibody Production using Genomic Amplification with DB00563 . BACKGROUND : DB00072 ( Herceptin ) is a humanized monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) which is used for specific treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with overexpression of P04626 /neu receptor . In this study , we have attempted to develop a biosimilar version of trastuzumab mAb . METHODS : According to in silico studies , the heavy and light chains of trastuzumab mAb were designed and constructed . The recombinant constructs were co-transfected in CHO DG44 cell line . Stable transformants were selected on a semi solid medium . Genomic amplification with methotrexate was achieved for heavy chain gene amplification . Biological activity of produced antibody in comparison with Herceptin was tested by flow cytometry method . RESULTS : Three folds of amplification were obtained after seven rounds of methotrexate treatments . The results indicated the equal expression level of heavy and light chains . The yield of purified mAb was between 50 to 60 mg/l /day . According to the results , the produced mAb had similar affinity to P04626 (+) tumor cells to that of Herceptin . CONCLUSION : High-level recombinant protein expression can be achieved by amplification of the recombinant gene with a selectable marker , such as Dihydrofolate Reductase ( P00374 ) . It is usually accepted that P00374 gene can be amplified in P00374 (－) CHO cells , which consequently leads to amplification of the co-linked target gene , and finally amplification of recombinant protein . In this research , with the aim of producing a biosimilar version of herceptin , the effect of genomic amplification was investigated on the increasing the gene copy number using quantitative real-time PCR . Impact of fish oil enriched total parenteral nutrition on DNA synthesis , cytokine release and receptor expression by lymphocytes in the postoperative period . A prospective randomized study on sixty patients was conducted to investigate the effects of a fish oil containing total parenteral nutrition ( O15533 ) regimen in the postoperative period on lymphocyte subset distribution , proliferation , cytokine production and interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) expression . Patients who underwent large bowel surgery were divided into three groups . Nineteen patients received O15533 with fish oil ( 0.2 g/kg body weight per day ) plus soybean oil ( 1.0 g/kg per day ) , twenty patients received soybean oil ( 1.2 g/kg per day ) , and twenty-one patients who were on a fat-free regimen served as the control group . Natural killer ( NK ) cells , total , B- , T- , DB00451 - , T8-lymphocytes , proliferation of lymphocytes , in vitro production of P60568 , P01579 , P01375 , and IL-2R expression were measured . Fish oil administration did not affect subset distribution and proliferation of lymphocytes . Production of interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) , interferon gamma ( P01579 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) was augmented , and IL-2R expression less enhanced compared with the controls . It is concluded that administration of 0.2 g/kg per day fish oil after a moderate surgical stress is not immunosuppressive , but enhances the production of P01579 , P01375 and possibly P60568 . P00797 status does not predict the anti-hypertensive response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in African-Americans . DB00519 Multicenter Study Group . The angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor trandolapril , a non-sulfhydryl prodrug which is hydrolysed into trandolaprilat , was studied in 322 hypertensives of African-American descent using a double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , parallel study design . Following 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo or 0.25 to 16 mg/day trandolapril , an analysis of drug effect on trough blood pressure ( BP ) stratified by age , gender , weight , pre-treatment plasma renin activity , and trandolaprilat concentration was performed . Two mg was the lowest effective trandolapril dose , whereas doses above 4 mg did not significantly reduce trough BP . Reduction in BP did not correlate with trough plasma trandolaprilat concentration . Pre-treatment plasma renin activity was not a reliable indicator of anti-hypertensive response , as similar reductions in BP occurred even in patients with the lowest renin levels . There were no observable differences based on age , gender or measurements of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis . In conclusion , neither age , gender or plasma renin activity influenced anti-hypertensive response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in African-Americans . Effects of retroviral-mediated P08183 expression on hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in culture . Ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells would be useful for bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy applications . Toward this goal , we have investigated whether retrovirally-transduced murine stem cells could be expanded in culture with hematopoietic cytokines . Bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing either the human multidrug resistance 1 gene ( HaMDR1 ) , a variant of human dihydrofolate reductase ( HaDHFR ) , or both P08183 and P00374 in an internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) -containing bicistronic vector ( HaMID ) . Cells were then expanded for 15 days in cultures stimulated with interleukin ( IL ) -3 , P05231 , and stem cell factor . When very low marrow volumes were injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice , long-term reconstitution with 100 % donor cells was seen in all mice injected with HaMDR1- or HaMID-transduced cells . By contrast , engraftment with HaDHFR- or mock-transduced cells ranged from partial to undetectable despite injection of significantly larger marrow volumes . In addition , mice transplanted with expanded HaMDR1- or HaMID-transduced stem cells developed a myeloproliferative disorder that was characterized by an increase in abnormal peripheral blood leukocytes . These results show that P08183 -transduced stem cells can be expanded in vitro with hematopoietic cytokines , but indicate that an increased stem cell division frequency can lead to stem cell damage . Pharmacological properties of thalidomide and its analogues . Thalidomide and its immunomodulatory imide drugs ( IMiDs ) analogues DB00480 ( DB00480 , DB00480 ) and CC-4047 ( Actimid , DB08910 ) have been used as anti-inflammatory and anticancerous drugs in the recent years . Thalidomide and IMiDs inhibit the cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , interleukins ( IL ) 1-beta , 6 , 12 , and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) . They also costimulate primary human T , NKT and NK lymphocytes inducing their proliferation , cytokine production , and cytotoxic activity . On the other hand , the compounds are anti-angiogenic , anti-proliferative , and pro-apoptotic . Thalidomide analogues have been used as inhibitors of alpha glucosidase and could be potential drugs for diabetes treatment . In this review , we explore the current trend of the different structures , the new patents , and the possible new applications in different pathologies . DB00563 selectable retroviral vectors for Gaucher disease . To develop a gene therapy protocol suitable for the treatment of a benign disease such as Gaucher disease , we have developed two bicistronic vectors that allow transduced cells to be selected for with methotrexate ( MTX ) . The two vectors differ in the presence or absence of a mutant polyoma enhancer ( delta Mo + PyF101 ) replacing the wild-type retroviral enhancer in the LTR . Infection of human TF-1 and K562 cells , Gaucher type II fibroblasts and murine hemopoietic bone marrow cells conferred MTX resistance and glucocerebrosidase ( GC ) expression . Upon increasing MTX concentrations , the number of proviral copies and GC activity increased , demonstrating in vitro selection of retrovirus-transduced cells . At high MTX selection pressure , up to 140 microM for infected Gaucher type II fibroblasts , no endogenous wild-type P00374 amplification could be detected , indicating that both retroviral constructs provide sufficient P00374 protein levels . Upon transduction , murine bone marrow cells were protected against otherwise lethal MTX concentrations ( range 1-5 microM MTX ) . Flow cytometry specific for human GC ( hGC ) demonstrated that in vitro selection resulted in increased percentages of hGC-positive murine cells . In conclusion , the generated bicistronic vectors are ideally suited to investigate whether an in vivo selection approach for retrovirus-transduced cells is feasible . Such a strategy might abolish the need for a high initial transduction efficiency and might result in a gene therapy protocol devoid of the undesirable need for marrow ablative treatment of the recipient .
cDNA array analysis of cytokines , chemokines , and receptors involved in the development of TNBS-induced colitis : homeostatic role of P01282 . Crohn 's disease ( CD ) is a chronic inflammatory pathology of the intestine , characterized by diarrhea and weight loss . A healing effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) in the murine model of CD based on 2,4,6-trinitrobencene sulfonic acid ( TNBS ) administration has been previously shown . The aim of this work was to analyze the expression of several mediators related to the inflammatory cascade in colitic and P01282 -treated animals . With this aim , mice received either only TNBS or TNBS and P01282 treatment on alternate days . cDNA microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed on total mRNA from colon to study the expression of a battery of proinflammatory molecules such as the enzyme P35354 , the chemokines P78423 , P48061 , O43927 , O95715 , P51681 , and P25025 , and the cytokines interleukin ( IL ) -1beta , IL-12 , Q14116 , P22301 , interferon-gamma , and P05112 . TNBS administration induced the expression of all the proinflammatory mediators studied , whereas P01282 treatment reduced their levels , increasing the anti-inflammatory P22301 and the TH2 cytokine P05112 , explaining its beneficial action through inhibition of the inflammatory/ Q8IXH7 response . These data describe not only the relation of several proinflammatory mediators to the development of TNBS colitis , reporting their time-course , but also show the beneficial action of P01282 in this model through complete blockage of the inflammatory cascade and recovery of the colon homeostasis , providing a potential new alternative for CD therapy . Inhibition of human steroid 5beta-reductase ( P51857 ) by finasteride and structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex . The Delta(4)-3-ketosteroid functionality is present in nearly all steroid hormones apart from estrogens . The first step in functionalization of the A-ring is mediated in humans by steroid 5alpha- or 5beta-reductase . DB01216 is a mechanism-based inactivator of 5alpha-reductase type 2 with subnanomolar affinity and is widely used as a therapeutic for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia . It is also used for androgen deprivation in hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma , and it has been examined as a chemopreventive agent in prostate cancer . The effect of finasteride on steroid 5beta-reductase ( P51857 ) has not been previously reported . We show that finasteride competitively inhibits P51857 with low micromolar affinity but does not act as a mechanism-based inactivator . The structure of the P51857 .NADP(+)*finasteride complex determined at 1.7 A resolution shows that it is not possible for NADPH to reduce the Delta(1-2)-ene of finasteride because the cofactor and steroid are not proximal to each other . The P01024 -ketone of finasteride accepts hydrogen bonds from the catalytic residues DB00135 -58 and DB00142 -120 in the active site of P51857 , providing an explanation for the competitive inhibition observed . This is the first reported structure of finasteride bound to an enzyme involved in steroid hormone metabolism . Specific Biomarkers Are Associated with Docetaxeland Gemcitabine-Resistant NSCLC Cell Lines . Five-year survival rate for lung cancer is limited to 10 % to 15 % . Therefore , the identification of novel therapeutic prognostic factors is an urgent requirement . The aim of this study is thus to highlight specific biomarkers in chemoresistant non-small cell lung cancer cell lines . Therefore , we checked-in the control condition as well as after short-term pharmacological treatment with either docetaxel or gemcitabine-the expression of genes such as tumor suppressor genes ( CDKN2A , P53355 , P49789 , P09211 , P16455 , RARβ2 , RASSF1A , and P35625 ) , genes associated with drug resistance ( P38398 , P35354 , P07992 , P17936 , P23921 , and Q13509 ) , and stemness-related genes ( CD133 , Q01860 , and O43623 ) in two cellular models of squamous carcinoma ( CAEP ) and adenocarcinoma ( RAL ) of the lung originally established . Their promoter methylation profile was also evaluated . Drug-related genes were upregulated . DB00515 resistance matched with high levels of P38398 and P07992 in both cell lines ; docetaxel sensitivity of CAEP cells was associated to levels of Q13509 lower than RAL cells . Although CAEP cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine , both cell lines showed high levels of P23921 . Stemness-related genes were downregulated in the control condition but became upregulated in docetaxel-resistant cells , indicating the selection of a population with stemness features . We did not find an unequivocal correspondence between gene expression and respective DNA promoter methylation status , suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms of gene expression regulation . These results highlight specific biomarkers consistent with the different responses of the two cell lines to standard pharmacological treatments and indicate specific molecular traits for their chemoresistance . Activating mutations of GNAS in canine cortisol-secreting adrenocortical tumors . BACKGROUND : Cushing 's syndrome or hypercortisolism is a common endocrinopathy in dogs . In approximately 15 % of cases , the disorder is caused by adrenocorticotropin ( DB01285 ) -independent hypersecretion of cortisol by an adrenocortical tumor ( AT ) . Without other explanation , the cortisol hypersecretion has been referred to as autonomous . OBJECTIVES : To investigate whether DB01285 -independent hypersecretion of cortisol may be associated with aberrant activation of the melanocortin 2 receptor ( Q01718 ) -cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) -protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway . ANIMALS : All analyses were performed on 44 cortisol-secreting ATs ( 14 adenomas and 30 carcinomas ) derived from dogs diagnosed with DB01285 -independent hypercortisolism . METHODS : Mutation analysis was performed of genes encoding the stimulatory G protein alpha subunit ( GNAS ) , Q01718 , and PKA regulatory subunit 1A ( P10644 ) in all ATs . RESULTS : Approximately one-third of all ATs harbored an activating mutation of GNAS . Missense mutations , known to result in constitutive activation , were present in codon 201 in 11 ATs , in codon 203 ( 1 AT ) , and in codon 227 ( 3 ATs ) . No functional mutations were found in Q01718 and P10644 . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE : Activation of DB02527 signaling is a frequent event in canine cortisol-secreting ATs and may play a crucial role in both DB01285 -independent cortisol production and tumor formation . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of potentially causative mutations in canine cortisol-secreting ATs . GABA , glutamate , dopamine and serotonin transporters expression on forgetting . Notwithstanding several neurotransmission systems are frequently related to memory formation ; forgetting process and neurotransmission systems or their transporters ; the role of γ-aminobutyric acid ( P30531 ) , glutamate ( EACC1 ) , dopamine ( Q01959 ) and serotonin ( P31645 ) is poorly understood . Hence , in this paper western-blot analysis was used to evaluate expression of P30531 , P43005 , Q01959 and P31645 during forgetting in trained and untrained rats treated with the selective serotonin transporter inhibitor fluoxetine , the amnesic drug d-methamphetamine ( METH ) and fluoxetine plus METH . Transporters expression was determined in the hippocampus ( HIP ) , prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) and striatum ( STR ) . Results indicated that forgetting of Pavlovian/instrumental autoshaping was associated to up-regulation of P30531 ( P27918 and HIP ) and Q01959 ( P27918 ) while P31645 ( HIP ) was down-regulated ; no-changes were observed in striatum . Methamphetamine administration did not affect forgetting at 216 h post-training but up-regulated hippocampal Q01959 and EACC , prefrontal cortex Q01959 and striatal P30531 or EACC1 . DB00472 alone prevented forgetting , which was associated to striatal P30531 and hippocampal Q01959 up-regulation , but prefrontal cortex P30531 down-regulation . DB00472 plus METH administration was also able to prevent forgetting , which was associated to hippocampal Q01959 , prefrontal cortex P31645 and striatal P30531 , Q01959 or P31645 up-regulation , but prefrontal cortex P30531 down-regulation . Together these data show that forgetting provokes primarily hippocampal and prefrontal cortex transporters changes ; forgetting represent a behavioral process hardly modifiable and its prevention could causes different transporters expression patterns . P35372 activation of P27361 /2 is P35626 and arrestin dependent in striatal neurons . In this study we investigated the mechanisms responsible for Q96HU1 kinase P27361 /2 activation following agonist activation of endogenous mu opioid receptors ( MOR ) normally expressed in cultured striatal neurons . Treatment with the MOR agonist fentanyl caused significant activation of P27361 /2 in neurons derived from wild type mice . Fentanyl effects were blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone and were not evident in neurons derived from MOR knock-out ( -/- ) mice . In contrast , P27361 /2 activation by fentanyl was not evident in neurons from P35626 -/- mice or neurons pretreated with small inhibitory RNA for arrestin3 . Consistent with this observation , treatment with the opiate morphine ( which is less able to activate arrestin ) did not elicit P27361 /2 activation in wild type neurons ; however , transfection of arrestin3-(R170E) ( a dominant positive form of arrestin that does not require receptor phosphorylation for activation ) enabled morphine activation of P27361 /2 . In addition , activation of P27361 /2 by fentanyl and morphine was rescued in P35626 -/- neurons following transfection with dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E) . The activation of P27361 /2 appeared to be selective as p38 Q96HU1 kinase activation was not increased by either fentanyl or morphine treatment in neurons from wild type , MOR-/- , or P35626 -/- mice . In addition , U0126 ( a selective inhibitor of MEK kinase responsible for P29323 phosphorylation ) blocked P27361 /2 activation by fentanyl . These results support the hypothesis that MOR activation of P27361 /2 requires opioid receptor phosphorylation by P35626 and association of arrestin3 to initiate the cascade resulting in P27361 /2 phosphorylation in striatal neurons . Dependence on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and DB01367 -RAF pathways drive the activity of RAF265 , a novel RAF/ P35968 inhibitor , and RAD001 ( DB01590 ) in combination . Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) -AKT and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue ( P01116 ) can induce cellular immortalization , proliferation , and resistance to anticancer therapeutics such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors or chemotherapy . This study assessed the consequences of inhibiting these two pathways in tumor cells with activation of P01116 , PI3K-AKT , or both . We investigated whether the combination of a novel RAF/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor , RAF265 , with a mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) inhibitor , RAD001 ( everolimus ) , could lead to enhanced antitumoral effects in vitro and in vivo . To address this question , we used cell lines with different status regarding P01116 , P42336 , and P15056 mutations , using immunoblotting to evaluate the inhibitors , and MTT and clonogenic assays for effects on cell viability and proliferation . Subcutaneous xenografts were used to assess the activity of the combination in vivo . RAD001 inhibited P42345 downstream signaling in all cell lines , whereas RAF265 inhibited RAF downstream signaling only in P15056 mutant cells . In vitro , addition of RAF265 to RAD001 led to decreased AKT , S6 , and P06730 binding protein 1 phosphorylation in HCT116 cells . In vitro and in vivo , RAD001 addition enhanced the antitumoral effect of RAF265 in HCT116 and H460 cells ( both P01116 mut , P42336 mut ) ; in contrast , the combination of RAF265 and RAD001 yielded no additional activity in A549 and MDAMB231 cells . The combination of RAF and P42345 inhibitors is effective for enhancing antitumoral effects in cells with deregulation of both DB01367 -RAF and PI3K , possibly through the cross-inhibition of 4E binding protein 1 and S6 protein . Comparison of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone with clozapine and olanzapine : inhibition of dorsal raphe cell firing and the role of P08908 receptor activation . Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent which binds with high affinity to P08908 receptors ( Ki = 3.4 nM ) , in addition to P28221 , 5-HT2 , and D2 sites . While it is an antagonist at these latter receptors , ziprasidone behaves as a P08908 agonist in vitro in adenylate cyclase measurements . The goal of the present study was to examine the P08908 properties of ziprasidone in vivo using as a marker of central P08908 activity the inhibition of firing of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus . In anesthetized rats , ziprasidone dose-dependently slowed raphe unit activity ( ED50 = 300 micrograms/kg i.v. ) as did the atypical antipsychotics clozapine ( ED50 = 250 micrograms/kg i.v. ) and olanzapine ( ED50 = 1000 micrograms/kg i.v. ) . Pretreatment with the P08908 antagonist WAY-100,635 ( 10 micrograms/kg i.v. ) prevented the ziprasidone-induced inhibition ; the same dose of WAY-100,635 had little effect on the inhibition produced by clozapine and olanzapine . Because all three agents also bind to alpha 1 receptors , antagonists of which inhibit serotonin neuronal firing , this aspect of their pharmacology was assessed with desipramine ( DB01151 ) , a NE re-uptake blocker previously shown to reverse the effects of alpha 1 antagonists on raphe unit activity . DB01151 ( 5 mg/kg i.v. ) failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of ziprasidone but produced nearly complete reversal of that of clozapine and olanzapine . These profiles suggest a mechanism of action for each agent , P08908 agonism for ziprasidone and alpha 1 antagonism for clozapine and olanzapine . The P08908 agonist activity reported here clearly distinguishes ziprasidone from currently available antipsychotic agents and suggests that this property may play a significant role in its pharmacologic actions . P35372 phosphorylation , desensitization , and ligand efficacy . Mu opioid receptors are subject to phosphorylation and desensitization through actions of at least two distinct biochemical pathways : agonist-dependent mu receptor phosphorylation and desensitization induced by a biochemically distinct second pathway dependent on protein kinase C activation ( 1 ) . To better understand the nature of the agonist-induced mu receptor phosphorylation events , we have investigated the effects of a variety of opiate ligands of varying potencies and intrinsic activities on mu receptor phosphorylation and desensitization . Exposure to the potent full agonists sufentanil , dihydroetorphine , etorphine , etonitazine , and [ D-Ala2 , MePhe4 , Glyol5 ] enkephalin ( DAMGO ) led to strong receptor phosphorylation , while methadone , l-alpha-acetylmethadone ( DB01227 ) , morphine , meperidine , DADL , beta-endorphin(1-31) , enkephalins , and dynorphin A(1-17) produced intermediate effects . The partial agonist buprenorphine minimally enhanced receptor phosphorylation while antagonists failed to alter phosphorylation . DB00921 and full antagonists each antagonized the enhanced mu receptor phosphorylation induced by morphine or DAMGO . The rank order of opiate ligand efficacies in producing mu receptor-mediated functional desensitization generally paralleled their rank order of efficacies in producing receptor phosphorylation . Interestingly , the desensitization and phosphorylation mediated by methadone and DB01227 were disproportionate to their efficacies in two distinct test systems . This generally good fit between the efficacies of opiates in mu receptor activation , phosphorylation , and desensitization supports the idea that activated receptor/agonist/G-protein complexes and/or receptor conformational changes induced by agonists are required for agonist-induced mu receptor phosphorylation . Data for methadone and DB01227 suggest possible contribution from their enhanced desensitizing abilities to their therapeutic efficacies . Skeletal receptors for steroid-family regulating glycoprotein hormones : A multilevel , integrated physiological control system . Pituitary glycoprotein hormone receptors , including Q01718 , P16473 , and P23945 , occur in bone . Their skeletal expression reflects that central endocrine control is evolutionarily recent . DB01285 receptors , in osteoblasts or the adrenal cortex , drive P15692 synthesis . P15692 is essential to maintain vasculature . In bone , DB01285 suppression by glucocorticoids can cause osteonecrosis . DB00024 receptors occur on osteoblasts and osteoclasts , in both cases reducing activity . Thus , DB00024 directly reduces skeletal turnover , consistent with evolutionary adaptation to stress . DB00094 receptors accelerate bone resorption , whereas estrogen promotes bone formation , the forces usually balancing . With ovarian failure , low estrogen with high DB00094 causes rapid bone loss . The skeletal DB00094 effect in the menopause seems paradoxical , but it is a logical adaptation in lactation , where prolonged DB00094 elevation also occurs . In addition to receptors , there is some synthesis of pituitary glycoproteins at distributed sites ; this is not well studied , but it may further modify the paradigm of central endocrine regulation . The Q7Z2W7 ion channel comprises direct Gq protein-activating capacity . The transient receptor potential ( TRP ) family of ion channels comprises receptors that are activated by a vast variety of physical as well as chemical stimuli . TRP channels interact in a complex manner with several intracellular signaling cascades , both up- and downstream of receptor activation . Investigating cascades stimulated downstream of the cold and menthol receptor Q7Z2W7 , we found evidence for both , functional and structural interaction of Q7Z2W7 with Gαq . We demonstrated menthol-evoked increase in intracellular Ca(2+) under extracellular Ca(2+)-free conditions , which was blocked by the P98160 inhibitors U73122 or edelfosine . This metabotropic Ca(2+) signal could be observed also in cells expressing a channel-dead ( i.e. non-conducting ) or a chloride-conducting Q7Z2W7 pore mutant . However , this intracellular metabotropic Ca(2+) signal could not be detected in Gαq deficient cells or in the presence of dominant-negative GαqX . Evidence for a close spatial proximity necessary for physical interaction of Q7Z2W7 and Gαq was provided by acceptor bleaching experiments demonstrating FRET between Q7Z2W7 - P27918 and Gαq-YFP . A Gαq-YFP mobility assay ( P42345 ) revealed a restricted diffusion of Gαq-YFP under conditions when Q7Z2W7 is immobilized in the plasma membrane . Moreover , a menthol-induced and Q7Z2W7 -mediated G protein activation could be demonstrated by FRET experiments monitoring the dissociation of Gαq-YFP from a Gβ/Gγ- P27918 complex , and by the exchange of radioactive [(35)S]GTPγS for GDP . Our observations lead to a view that extends the operational range of the Q7Z2W7 receptor from its function as a pure ion channel to a molecular switch with additional metabotropic capacity . Msx2 promotes cardiovascular calcification by activating paracrine Wnt signals . In diabetic P01130 -/- mice , an ectopic P12643 -Msx2 gene regulatory program is upregulated in association with vascular calcification . We verified the procalcific actions of aortic Msx2 expression in vivo . CMV-Msx2 transgenic ( CMV-Msx2Tg(+) ) mice expressed 3-fold higher levels of aortic Msx2 than nontransgenic littermates . On high-fat diets , CMV-Msx2Tg(+) mice exhibited marked cardiovascular calcification involving aortic and coronary tunica media . This corresponded to regions of Msx2 immunoreactivity in adjacent adventitial myofibroblasts , suggesting a potential paracrine osteogenic signal . To better understand Msx2-regulated calcification , we studied actions in 10T1/2 cells . We found that conditioned media from Msx2-transduced 10T1/2 cells ( Msx2-CM ) is both pro-osteogenic and adipostatic ; these features are characteristic of Wnt signaling . Msx2-CM stimulated Wnt-dependent TCF/LEF transcription , and Msx2-transduced cells exhibited increased nuclear beta-catenin localization with concomitant alkaline phosphatase induction . Msx2 upregulated Wnt3a and Wnt7a but downregulated expression of the canonical inhibitor Dkk1 . Dkk1 treatment reversed osteogenic and adipostatic actions of Msx2 . DB06285 , a Q03431 agonist that inhibits murine vascular calcification , suppressed vascular P12643 -Msx2-Wnt signaling . Analyses of CMV-Msx2Tg(+) mice confirmed that Msx2 suppresses aortic Dkk1 and upregulates vascular Wnts ; moreover , TOPGAL(+) ( Wnt reporter ) ; CMV-Msx2Tg(+) mice exhibited augmented aortic LacZ expression . Thus , Msx2-expressing cells elaborated an osteogenic milieu that promotes vascular calcification in part via paracrine Wnt signals . Selective estrogen receptor modulation influences atherosclerotic plaque composition in a rabbit menopause model . OBJECTIVE : Osteoporosis trials suggest raloxifene decreased cardiovascular events in women with pre-existing atherosclerosis . We assessed the hypothesis that selective estrogen receptor modulation induces plaque stability in " menopausal " animals . METHODS AND RESULTS : Atherosclerosis was induced in 42 ovariectomized New Zealand white rabbits by cholesterol feeding and mechanical injury . Animals were imaged by magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) for baseline atherosclerosis , and randomized to control ( OVX ( ovariectomized control group ) , n=12 ) , raloxifene 35-60 mg/kg/day by diet admixture ( RLX ( raloxifene therapy group ) , n=24 ) , or immediate sacrifice ( n=6 ) for immunohistopathologic correlation of Q9BWK5 . Six months later , rabbits underwent repeat Q9BWK5 then sacrifice for micro-computed tomography ( microCT ) and molecular analysis . Unlike OVX , RLX reduced atheroma volume . Analysis for lesion inflammation revealed reductions in P35354 ( cyclooxygenase-2 ) , P03956 ( matrix metalloproteinase-1 ) , P13500 ( monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ) expression and macrophage infiltration in RLX versus OVX with concomitant upregulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). microCT showed similar total vascular calcification between groups , but calcifications in RLX were less nodular with better radial organization ( mean calcific arc angle 63+/-7 degrees versus 33+/-6 degrees in OVX ) , the predicted result of a 53 % increase in P12643 ( bone-morphogenetic protein-2 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Raloxifene treatment results in reduced lesion volume , enhanced mechanical stability of vascular calcification , and less inflamed lesions characterized by less macrophage infiltration and reduced P35354 , P03956 and P13500 expression . Inhibitory effects of botulinum toxin on P28335 receptor-induced Cl- current in Xenopus oocytes . Several low molecular weight G proteins have been identified , but their functional roles remain unclear . To clarify the involvement of low molecular weight G protein in receptor-stimulated turnover of polyphosphoinositide ( PI ) turnover , influences of botulinum toxins on serotonin ( 5-HT ) -stimulated Cl- current mediated by PI turnover were investigated using Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA . Treatment with botulinum toxin C , D or purified ADP-ribosyltransferase of botulinum toxin ( botulinum toxin P01024 enzyme ) inhibited the 5-HT-induced Cl- current in oocytes , and ADP-ribosylated 23 kDa proteins . Both botulinum toxin P01024 enzyme-induced inhibition of the current and ADP-ribosylation were suppressed by pretreatment with antibotulinum toxin P01024 enzyme antibody . Botulinum toxin D treatment of oocytes was ineffective in the response of Cl- current induced by injection of 50 pmol inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 50 pmol Ca2+ . It is suggested that low molecular weight G proteins ADP-ribosylated by botulinum toxin P01024 enzyme are involved in phospholipase C activation in Xenopus oocytes . Serum levels of DB01277 and P17936 during adjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer . High serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 ( DB01277 ) are associated with an increased risk of breast , prostate , colorectal , and lung cancer whereas IGF binding protein-3 ( P17936 ) seems to exert a protective effect . Therefore , patients may benefit from low DB01277 levels and high P17936 levels . This study evaluated whether adjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy modulates DB01277 and/or P17936 serum levels in breast cancer patients . In 18 patients undergoing adjuvant treatment for primary breast cancer , DB01277 and P17936 serum levels were measured with immunoassays during chemotherapy regimens of either 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin and cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide ( EC ) . Mean pre-treatment values of DB01277 and P17936 were 124+/-13 and 3698+/-186 ng/ml , respectively . No significant changes in DB01277 and P17936 serum concentrations were observed during adjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy . DB01277 levels significantly correlated with P17936 levels before and during chemotherapy . In conclusion , these chemotherapy regimens do not seem to modulate DB01277 or P17936 levels in a favourable or unfavourable way . Whole blood lead concentration and erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase ( P13716 ) activity in selected canine populations in Greece . In a total number of 275 dogs of various ages , sex and breed , blood lead concentrations ( O43927 ) and erythrocyte P13716 activity were measured . Sixty-six of the dogs were living in lead mining areas ( Group A ) , 157 in urban areas ( Group B ) and 52 in rural areas ( Group C ) of Greece . Mean O43927 differed significantly ( P < 0.05 ) between locations and were 326,97 and 68 micrograms/L , respectively . Mean P13716 activity was significantly different ( P < 0.05 ) only between Groups A and B as between groups A and C . A significant ( P < 0.05 ) negative correlation existed between O43927 and P13716 activity . A normal range of erythrocyte P13716 activity of 807-992 mumol/ DB02272 /LRBC/h was established for dogs . None of the 33 Group A dogs and 2 of the Group B dogs that had a O43927 of 350 micrograms/L presented clinical signs indicating acute or chronic lead intoxication . No erythrocyte basophilic stippling or large number of nucleated red blood cells were seen in the 30 dogs of Group A with O43927 > 350 micrograms/L . DB00472 induces preventive and complex effects against colon cancer development in epithelial and stromal areas in rats . DB00472 ( FLX ) is a drug commonly used as antidepressant . However , its effects on tumorigenesis remain controversial . Aiming to evaluate the effects of FLX treatment on early malignant changes , we analyzed serotonin ( 5-HT ) metabolism and recognition , aberrant crypt foci ( Q9NQ94 ) , proliferative process , microvessels , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression in colon tissue . Male Wistar rats received a daily FLX-gavage ( 30mgkg(-1) ) and , a single dose of 1,2 dimethylhydrazine ( Q03001 ; i.p. , 125mgkg(-1) ) . After 6 weeks of FLX-treatment , our results revealed that FLX and nor-fluoxetine ( N-FLX ) are present in colon tissue , which was related to significant increase in serotonin ( 5-HT ) levels ( P < 0.05 ) possibly through a blockade in P31645 mRNA ( serotonin reuptake transporter ; P < 0.05 ) resulting in lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-HIAA ) levels ( P < 0.01 ) and , P28335 receptor mRNA expressions . FLX-treatment decreased dysplastic Q9NQ94 development ( P < 0.01 ) and proliferative process ( P < 0.001 ) in epithelia . We observed a significant decrease in the development of malignant microvessels ( P < 0.05 ) , P15692 ( P < 0.001 ) , and P35354 expression ( P < 0.01 ) . These findings suggest that FLX may have oncostatic effects on carcinogenic colon tissue , probably due to its modulatory activity on 5-HT metabolism and/or its ability to reduce colonic malignant events . Can P35354 inhibitor-induced increase in cardiovascular disease risk be modified by essential fatty acids ? Selective P35354 inhibitors increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke . This has been attributed to their ability to inhibit endothelial P35354 derived prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) but not platelet P23219 derived thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) . On the other hand , aspirin blocks both P23219 and P35354 enzymes without decreasing DB01240 but blocks TXA2 synthesis that explains its beneficial action in the prevention of coronary heart disease ( Q8NE62 ) . The inhibitory action of aspirin on P23219 and P35354 enzymes enhances the tissue concentrations of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ( DB00154 ) , arachidonic acid , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , and docosahexaenoic acid ( DB01708 ) . These fatty acids form precursors to PGE1 , DB01240 , PGI3 , lipoxins ( LXs ) , and resolvins that have anti-inflammatory actions . In contrast , increase in the concentrations of DB00154 , AA , EPA , and DB01708 is much less with specific P35354 inhibitors since they do not block the formation of eicosanoids through P23219 pathway . P35354 inhibitors interfere with the formation of LXs and resolvins that have neuroprotective and cardioprotective actions . EPA and DB01240 have anti-arrhythmic action . EPA , DB01708 , and AA augment eNO formation that prevents atherosclerosis . This suggests that P35354 inhibitors increase cardiovascular and stroke risk by interfering with the formation of eNO , DB01240 , LXs , and resolvins and implies that combining EFAs with P35354 inhibitors could prevent these complications . Serotonin and fluoxetine receptors are expressed in enamel organs and LS8 cells and modulate gene expression in LS8 cells . The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) fluoxetine is widely used in the treatment of depression in children and fertile women , but its effect on developing tissues has been sparsely investigated . The aim of this study was to investigate if enamel organs and ameloblast-derived cells express serotonin receptors that are affected by peripherally circulating serotonin or fluoxetine . Using RT-PCR and western blot analysis we found that enamel organs from 3-d-old mice and ameloblast-like cells ( LS8 cells ) express functional serotonin receptors , the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis ( Thp1 ) , as well as the serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) , indicating that enamel organs and ameloblasts are able to respond to serotonin and regulate serotonin availability . DB00472 and serotonin enhanced the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cell culture medium from cultured LS8 cells , whereas the expression of enamelin ( Enam ) , amelogenin ( Amel ) , and matrix metalloproteinase-20 ( O60882 ) were all significantly down-regulated . The secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( P13500 ) , and interferon-inducible protein 10 ( P02778 ) was also reduced compared with controls . In conclusion , enamel organs and ameloblast-like cells express functional serotonin receptors . Reduced transcription of enamel proteins and secretion of vascular factors may indicate possible adverse effects of fluoxetine on amelogenesis . Paraplegic mice are leading to new advances in spinal cord injury research . STUDY DESIGN : Experimental laboratory investigations with paraplegic mouse models . OBJECTIVES : To review the most recent advances in the field of spinal cord injury research ; immune system response , regeneration , and functional recovery . SETTINGS : Laval University and Laval University Medical Center , Quebec , Canada . METHODS : Assessment of regenerative processes and locomotor function recovery induced by a variety of treatments and approaches in wild-type and genetically engineered mice with complete or incomplete lesions of the spinal cord . RESULTS : Recent studies have reported a number of significant observations providing additional insight into the role and mechanism of regeneration , immune system response , and functional recovery after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) using incomplete paraplegic mice with Nogo-A , Q9BZR6 , EphA4 , P14136 /vimentime , P15018 , or Fas gene knock-out . A novel antibody called P02778 was also recently found to increase tissue sparing and angiogenesis after SCI . In an attempt to explore the possibilities of reactivating spared neurons below the injury level , researchers have found that pharmacological activation of specific subtypes of serotonin receptors ( eg , P08908 /2A/7 ) can sustain the production of basic locomotor-like movements in complete paraplegic mice . CONCLUSION : The growing availability of genetically engineered and mutant mouse strains along with molecular biology tools has led scientists to increasingly use murine models in SCI research . These new tools and models may assist scientists in understanding further the complex pathological consequences of SCI . DB00472 -induced proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells isolated from rat postnatal cerebellum . Previous studies have shown that the serotonin-reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) fluoxetine affects neural progenitors derived from postnatal cerebellum or adult hippocampus and stimulates their proliferation . In the human cerebellum , the proliferation of cerebellar granule cells ( CGC ) continues until the 11th postnatal month and could be influenced in infants by breastfeeding-delivered SSRIs . Current information about fluoxetine effects on postnatal cerebellar neural progenitors is limited . Here we report the characterization of fluoxetine actions on rat postnatal cerebellar neural progenitors . RT-PCR and immunostaining revealed the expression of serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) , 5HT(1A) receptors , tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) , and serotonin ( 5HT ) . Protracted in vitro fluoxetine treatment increased cell proliferation and differentiation . The proliferative effects of fluoxetine , 5HT , and the selective agonist of 5HT(1A) receptors trans-8-hydroxy-2-(N-n-propyl-N-3'-iodo-2'-propenyl)aminotetralin ( 8-OH-PIPAT ) were abolished by the selective antagonist of 5HT(1A) receptors , N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride ( WAY-100635 ) . Furthermore , fluoxetine-induced activation of both the DB02527 -response element-binding ( CREB ) protein and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ( P27361 /2 ) , which was abolished by the selective inhibitor of Q96HU1 kinase kinase ( MEK ) 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene ( U0126 ) , and increased cyclin D1 expression . All these effects were prevented by WAY-100635 . Collectively , our results demonstrate that rat postnatal cerebellum contains neural progenitors capable of proliferating and differentiating in response to fluoxetine exposure , possibly through the activation of 5HT(1A) receptors . The relevance of these findings for possible SSRI effects on the developing postnatal/infant human cerebellum should be explored .
Array-comparative genomic hybridization to detect genomewide changes in microdissected primary and metastatic oral squamous cell carcinomas . Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is a common worldwide malignancy . However , it is unclear what , if any , genomic alterations occur as the disease progresses to invasive and metastatic OSCC . This study used genomewide array-CGH in microdissected specimens to map genetic alterations found in primary OSCC and neck lymph node metastases . We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization ( array-CGH ) to screen genomewide alterations in eight pairs of microdissected tissue samples from primary and metastatic OSCC . In addition , 25 primary and metastatic OSCC tissue pairs were examined with immunohistochemistry for protein expression of the most frequently altered genes . The highest frequencies of gains were detected in P12524 , Q04864 , TERC , P42336 , P10242 , P08183 , P01112 , GARP , P30279 , P07332 , P04626 , P01127 , and Q05066 . The highest frequencies of losses were detected in p44S10 , O15164 , P06858 , Q13126 , P35226 , P11161 , and Q13163 . Genomic alterations in TGFbeta2 , cellular retinoid-binding protein 1 gene ( P09455 ) , P42336 , P28222 , P01112 , P21860 , and O14965 differed significantly between primary OSCC and their metastatic counterparts . Genomic alterations in Q05513 , P00519 , and P08620 were significantly different in patients who died compared with those who survived . Immunohistochemistry confirmed high P42336 immunoreactivity in primary and metastatic OSCC . Higher P08620 immunoreactivity in primary OSCC is associated with a worse prognosis . Loss of P09455 immunoreactivity is evident in primary and metastatic OSCC . Our study suggests that precise genomic profiling can be useful in determining gene number changes in OSCC . As our understanding of these changes grow , this profiling may become a practical tool for clinical evaluation . Q16647 gene transfer inhibits neointimal formation by suppressing Q07869 delta expression . OBJECTIVE : DB01240 ( P06744 (2) ) is a potent ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta ( Q07869 delta ) that regulates cell growth and differentiation . The aim of this study was to elucidate how endogenous P06744 (2) overexpression affects the expressions of Q07869 delta and mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) in the development of neointimal formation in experimental angioplasty with adenovirus-mediated P06744 (2) synthase ( Ad-PGIS ) gene transfer . METHODS AND RESULTS : In human aortic smooth muscle cells , protein blotting analysis showed that P06744 (2) overproduction decreased the levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK ( P-p38 MAPK ) ( 2.0-fold versus 0.83-fold relative to control ) . Immunohistochemical analysis in balloon-injured arteries revealed diffuse expression of Q07869 delta in the neointima of control vessels , with no expression in uninjured vessels . The level of Q07869 delta expression was lower in Ad-PGIS-treated arteries than in control vessels , with the Q07869 delta localized in the neointima adjacent to endothelium . Staining of P-p38 MAPK showed a similar pattern to Q07869 delta among the three groups . Morphometric analysis at day 14 revealed that Ad-PGIS reduced the intima-to-media ratio by up to 59 % . CONCLUSIONS : Ad-PGIS gene transfer reduced Q07869 delta expression and inhibited neointimal formation after balloon injury in accordance with the reduction in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK . Regulation of DB02527 phosphodiesterase mRNAs expression in rat brain by acute and chronic fluoxetine treatment . An in situ hybridization study . Changes in brain cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) have been suggested to underlie the clinical action of antidepressant treatments . Also , a regionally-selective regulation of DB02527 -specific phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) has been demonstrated for some antidepressants . To further investigate the effects of antidepressant treatments on PDEs , we examined the expression of different DB02527 -specific PDEs in the brain of rats treated ( 1 and 14 days ) with fluoxetine 3 mg/kg day . The mRNAs coding for P27815 , Q07343 , Q08499 , and the five known Q08499 splice variants were analyzed by in situ hybridization on 45 brain structures of acute and chronic fluoxetine-treated rats . We also examined the binding sites for the putative antidepressant drug [(3)H]rolipram , a DB05876 -selective inhibitor . In some brain areas single fluoxetine administration increased the density of the mRNA of all DB05876 isozymes , except Q08499 and PDE4D5 . Chronic fluoxetine treatment increased P27815 mRNA levels and decreased those for Q07343 , Q08499 and PDE4D1 mRNAs in some brain regions . The study was complemented with the analysis of the expression of the transcripts of P23560 . Chronic fluoxetine treatment down-regulated the expression of P23560 . These results show that the expression of DB05876 isozymes is modulated by a clinically relevant fluoxetine dose . The significance of these changes in DB05876 expression to the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine is discussed . Expression of cellular retinol-binding protein and lecithin-retinol acyltransferase in developing rat testis . DB00162 deficiency in mammals results in the loss of germ cells on the adluminal side of the blood-testis barrier , suggesting a need for vitamin A that would be supplied by the surrounding Sertoli cells . P09455 ( P09455 ) and lecithin-retinol acyltransferase ( O95237 ) are two proteins found in Sertoli cells that are known to be involved in vitamin A trafficking . To clarify the role of these two proteins in the delivery of vitamin A to developing germ cells , we have examined changes in their cell-specific expression during the onset of puberty in the rat . In adult rats , Sertoli cell expression of P09455 varies with the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium . Here , we demonstrate that differences in the intensity of P09455 immunoreactivity are detectable in Sertoli cells of different tubules as early as postnatal Day 4 , prior to the onset of meiosis . This indicates that variable expression of P09455 by Sertoli cells is established independently of late germ cells and may anticipate the cyclical variation seen in the adult . We further demonstrate that the specific activity of O95237 in rat testis increases tenfold between postnatal Days 20 and 35 . This increase is attributable to the appearance of post-meiotic germ cells : the O95237 activity of microsomes prepared from a round spermatid-enriched cell fraction from post-pubertal rat testis could account for the majority of the O95237 activity observed in the whole testis . The presence of O95237 activity within adluminal germ cells suggests that they receive vitamin A as retinol and synthesize the retinyl esters that have been shown to be present in mature sperm . Inhibition of noradrenaline release via presynaptic P28222 receptors of the rat vena cava . In the rat inferior vena cava preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline , the effects of nine serotonin ( 5-HT ) receptor agonists and of eight antagonists ( including two beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents ) on the electrically evoked 3H overflow were determined . 1 . 5-HT , 5-carboxamido-tryptamine , 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)-1H-indole ( RU 24969 ) , 5-methoxytryptamine , N,N-dimethyl-5HT , tryptamine and 5-aminotryptamine inhibited the evoked 3H overflow . The potencies of these agonists in inhibiting overflow were significantly correlated with their affinities for P28222 binding sites , but not with their affinities for P08908 , P28335 or 5-HT2 binding sites . 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) , a P08908 receptor agonist , and ipsapirone , a partial agonist at these receptors , did not inhibit overflow . 2 . Cyanopindolol facilitated the evoked 3H overflow , an effect which was abolished by propranolol . The maximum inhibition of overflow obtainable with 5-HT was diminished by cyanopindolol . 3 . The concentration-response curve for 5-HT was shifted to the right by metitepine , metergoline , quipazine , 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine ( MK 212 ) and propranolol which , given alone , did not affect 3H overflow . The apparent pA2 values of these antagonists tended to be correlated with their affinities for P28222 ( but not P08908 , P28335 or 5-HT2 ) binding sites . Ketanserin , a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist , and spiperone , which blocks 5-HT2 and P08908 but not P28222 or P28335 receptors , failed to antagonize the effect of 5-HT. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) NO-donor P35354 inhibitors . New nitrooxy-substituted 1,5-diarylimidazoles endowed with P35354 inhibitory and vasodilator properties . A series of NO-donor diarylimidazoles derived from the lead compound DB05095 were synthesized and evaluated for their P35354 inhibitory activity and their stability in whole blood as well as for vasodilator properties . The products are partly transformed into the corresponding alcohols following 24-h incubation in whole blood . All of them display good P23219 / P35354 selectivity , but are less potent than the lead ; a molecular modeling study was carried out to investigate their binding mode . The compounds are also capable of relaxing rat aorta strips precontracted with phenylephrine with a NO-dependent mechanism ; this property could confer reduced cardiotoxicity with respect to traditional P35354 inhibitors . Q92847 agonist ( DB05657 ) accelerates gastric emptying in adults with diabetes and symptomatic gastroparesis . BACKGROUND : DB05657 is a synthetic , selective ghrelin agonist in development for gastroparesis . AIM : To assess safety and effects of DB05657 in diabetes patients with symptomatic gastroparesis . METHODS : Adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus received placebo and DB05657 ( 80 , 160 , 320 or 600 microg/kg ) infusions in a cross-over manner following a radiolabelled meal . Blood glucose levels were stabilized using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp . Primary endpoints were gastric half emptying and latency times . Secondary measures included assessment of gastroparesis symptoms and endocrine responses . RESULTS : Ten patients with type 1 ( n = 7 ) or 2 ( n = 3 ) diabetes , moderate-to-severe gastroparesis symptoms and > or =29 % retention 4 h after a radiolabelled solid meal were enrolled . DB05657 produced significant reductions in solid meal half-emptying ( 20 % , P = 0.043 ) and latency ( 34 % , P = 0.037 ) times vs. placebo . Reductions in overall postmeal symptom intensity ( 24 % ) and postprandial fullness ( 37 % ) following DB05657 infusion were not statistically significant . Most adverse events were mild and self-limiting and there were no identifiable differences in numbers or types of adverse events between DB05657 and placebo . CONCLUSIONS : This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the ghrelin agonist DB05657 is well-tolerated in diabetes patients with moderate-to-severe chronic gastroparesis and shows statistically significant improvements in gastric emptying . Tandutinib , an oral , small-molecule inhibitor of P36888 for the treatment of AML and other cancer indications . An improved understanding of acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) over the past two decades has led to a characterization of associated recurring cytogenetic abnormalities . AML is often driven by the overexpression or constitutive activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as P36888 ( P36888 ) , which serves as a good therapeutic target . Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc 's DB05465 ( DB05465 ) is an orally active inhibitor of P36888 kinase and family members P09619 beta and c-Kit . Tandutinib inhibited P36888 phosphorylation , downstream signaling and malignant growth in vitro and in animal models . The drug exhibited limited activity as a single agent in phase I and II clinical trials in patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome , but displayed promising antileukemic activity ( 90 % complete remissions ) in a phase I/II trial in patients with newly diagnosed AML when administered in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin . Phase II clinical trials for DB05465 are ongoing in patients with AML or renal cell carcinoma . Presynaptic serotonergic inhibition of GABAergic synaptic transmission in mechanically dissociated rat basolateral amygdala neurons . 1. The basolateral amygdala ( P00519 ) nuclei contribute to the process of anxiety . GABAergic transmission is critical in these nuclei and serotonergic inputs from dorsal raphe nuclei also significantly regulate GABA release . In mechanically dissociated rat P00519 neurons , spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents ( mIPSCs ) arising from attached GABAergic presynaptic nerve terminals were recorded with the nystatin-perforated patch method and pharmacological isolation . 2 . 5-HT reversibly reduced the GABAergic mIPSC frequency without affecting the mean amplitude . The serotonergic effect was mimicked by the P08908 specific agonist 8-OH DPAT ( 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ) and blocked by the P08908 antagonist spiperone . 3 . The GTP-binding protein inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide removed the serotonergic inhibition of mIPSC frequency . In either K+-free or Ca2+-free external solution , 5-HT could inhibit mIPSC frequency . 4 . High K+ stimulation increased mIPSC frequency and 8-OH DPAT inhibited this increase even in the presence of Cd2+ . 5 . DB02587 , an activator of adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) , significantly increased synaptic GABA release frequency . Pretreatment with forskolin prevented the serotonergic inhibition of mIPSC frequency in both the standard and high K+ external solution . 6 . Ruthenium Red ( RR ) , an agent facilitating the secretory process in a Ca2+-independent manner , increased synaptic GABA release . 5-HT also suppressed RR-facilitated mIPSC frequency . 7 . We conclude that 5-HT inhibits GABAergic mIPSCs by inactivating the AC- DB02527 signal transduction pathway via a G-protein-coupled P08908 receptor and this intracellular pathway directly acts on the GABA-releasing process independent of K+ and Ca2+ channels in the presynaptic nerve terminals . Signaling pathways mediating induction of the early response genes prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 and egr-1 by serotonin via 5- Q13049 receptors . Signaling pathways responsible for serotonin ( 5-HT ) -mediated induction of early response genes prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 ( P35354 , cyclooxygenase-2 ) and egr-1 were investigated in rat mesangial cells . Gene induction by 5-HT was dependent on 5- Q13049 receptors that were pertussis toxin insensitive indicating coupling to a G-protein of the Gq family . Binding of 5-HT to this receptor activates phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C ( P98160 ) and release of Ca2+ from internal stores , but this activation was not related to P35354 mRNA expression . Similarly , P19957 kinase was not involved in 5-HT signaling . Instead , inhibition of phosphatidylcholine-specific P98160 interfered with P35354 and egr-1 mRNA induction , suggesting this enzyme as a link between 5- Q13049 receptors and protein kinase C , an essential part of 5-HT-mediated signaling . The Q96HU1 kinase pathway was identified as common signaling pathway of 5-HT or phorbol ester-induced gene expression . Increase of intracellular DB02527 by forskolin or dibutyryl DB02527 did not induce P35354 or egr-1 mRNA expression by itself , but strongly inhibited 5-HT-mediated mRNA induction . P35354 mRNA and protein induction by 5-HT was also abolished by chelation of Ca2+ ions by EGTA , suggesting involvement of Ca2+-dependent enzymes . In contrast , egr-1 mRNA expression was superinduced in the presence of EGTA . Induction of Egr-1 protein was not changed by EGTA hinting to Ca2+-sensitive posttranscriptional steps . Activation of the Gq-coupled 5- Q13049 receptor thus leads to the expression of the early response genes P35354 and egr-1 , using common as well as differing signaling elements that allow differential regulation of the expression of these genes that are functionally related to renal hemodynamics and proliferation of mesangial cells , respectively . Improved islet yields from pancreas preserved in perflurocarbon is via inhibition of apoptosis mediated by mitochondrial pathway . Islet transplantation is a treatment option for type I diabetic patients . Preservation of human pancreata prior to islet isolation using two-layer method with perfluorocarbon ( P27918 ) and University of Wisconsin solution ( UW ) results in twofold increase in islet yields . The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which islets undergo apoptosis and determine P27918 's effects on this process . Gene array analysis was used to analyze the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in islets isolated from pancreata preserved under varying conditions . A 12-fold increase in the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis ( IAP ) and survivin was observed in islets isolated from pancreata preserved in P27918 . This was accompanied by decreased expression of Q92934 ( 3.7-fold ) , Q07812 ( 2.7-fold ) and caspases ( 5.2-fold ) . Levels of activated caspase-9 ( 77.98 % ) , caspase-2 ( 61.5 % ) , caspase-3 ( 68.3 % ) and caspase-8 ( 37.2 % ) were also reduced . ' Rescue ' of pancreata after storage ( 12 h ) in UW by preservation using P27918 also resulted in a down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes and inhibition of caspase activation . Apoptosis observed in islets from all groups was mainly mitochondria-dependent , mediated by change in redox potential initiated by hypoxia . We demonstrate that reduction in hypoxia of pancreata preserved using P27918 leads to significant up-regulation of anti-apoptotic and inhibition of pro-apoptotic genes . Rikkunshito , a Kampo medicine , ameliorates post-operative ileus by anti-inflammatory action . Rikkunshito ( RKT ) , a Kampo ( Japanese herbal ) medicine , is used as a prokinetic for patients with various diseases including functional dyspepsia . RKT promotes delayed gastric emptying via 5- Q9H205 receptor blockade . Otherwise , RKT increases ghrelin release via P41595 and P28335 receptor activation . Recent studies revealed that ghrelin and 5- Q9H205 receptor antagonists have an anti-inflammatory effect . So we hypothesize that RKT may have an anti-inflammatory action in the post-operative ileus . Intestinal manipulation ( IM ) was applied to the distal ileum of mice . RKT was administered orally 4 times before and after IM . Gastrointestinal transit in vivo , leukocyte infiltration , and gastric emptying were analyzed . We also investigated the effects of the 5- Q9H205 receptor agonist m-chlorophenylbiguamide ( mCPBG ) and ghrelin-receptor antagonist [ D-Lys3 ] - Q92847 -6 on the ameliorative action of RKT . RKT treatment led to recovery of the delayed intestinal transit and gastric emptying rate induced by IM . RKT significantly inhibited the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages . [ D-Lys3 ] - Q92847 -6 reduced and mCPBG partially reduced the RKT-mediated anti-inflammatory activity , as monitored by infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils . RKT serves as a novel therapeutic agent for POI characterized by its anti-inflammatory potency , in addition to prokinetic action . The RKT-induced anti-inflammatory activity may be partly mediated by inhibition of the 5- Q9H205 receptor and ghrelin release . LG839 : anti-obesity effects and polymorphic gene correlates of reward deficiency syndrome . INTRODUCTION : This study systematically assessed the weight management effects of a novel experimental DNA-customized nutraceutical , LG839 ( LifeGen , Inc. , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . METHODS : A total of 1058 subjects who participated in the overall D.I.E.T. study were genotyped and administered an LG839 variant based on polymorphic outcomes . A subset of 27 self-identified obese subjects of Dutch descent , having the same DNA pattern of four out of the five candidate genes tested ( chi-square analysis ) as the entire data set , was subsequently evaluated . Simple t tests comparing a number of weight management parameters before and after 80 days of treatment with LG839 were performed . RESULTS : Significant results were observed for weight loss , sugar craving reduction , appetite suppression , snack reduction , reduction of late night eating ( all P < 0.01 ) , increased perception of overeating , enhanced quality of sleep , increased happiness ( all P < 0.05 ) , and increased energy ( P < 0.001 ) . Polymorphic correlates were obtained for a number of genes ( P41159 , Q07869 -gamma2 , P42898 , 5- Q13049 , and P14416 genes ) with positive clinical parameters tested in this study . Of all the outcomes and gene polymorphisms , only the P14416 gene polymorphism ( A1 allele ) had a significant Pearson correlation with days on treatment ( r=0.42 , P=0.045 ) . CONCLUSION : If these results are confirmed in additional rigorous , controlled studies , we carefully suggest that DNA-directed targeting of certain regulator genes , along with customized nutraceutical intervention , provides a unique framework and strategic modality to combat obesity . [ Signal transduction inhibitor -- STI571 -- a new treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , which opens a new targeted approach to cancer therapy ] . Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , in most of the cases , is the molecular consequence of the t(9,22) translocation , resulting in the Philadelphia ( Ph ) chromosome and the creation of the fusion gene P11274 - P00519 . The fusion gene is translated to the protooncogen P11274 - P00519 , a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is linked to the malignant transformation . Thus , this tyrosine kinase became an attractive target for drug design . The development of the novel investigational drug DB00619 is based on its potent and selective ability to inhibit this fusion tyrosine kinase . In preclinical studies , DB00619 selectively inhibited the growth of CML cells that carry the Ph chromosome . In this review we discuss the drug development and design , its mechanism of action , the preclinical studies and the results of phase I and II clinical trials . Role of presynaptic serotonergic receptors on the mechanism of action of P08908 and P28222 agonists on masculine sexual behaviour : physiological and pharmacological implications . In order to establish whether the P08908 or the 5HT1B agonists , 8-OH-DPAT or TFMPP , produce their facilitatory or inhibitory actions on masculine sexual behaviour via a mechanism involving : ( a ) the serotonin synthesis or release ; ( b ) the stimulation of presynaptic receptors , or ( c ) the stimulation of somatodendritic receptors , three series of experiments were performed . The administration of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor , p-chlorophenylalanine ( p- P15085 , 300 mg/kg x 3 days ) , facilitated sexual behaviour but does not interfere neither with the inhibitory nor with the facilitatory effects of TFMPP ( 0.5 mg/kg ) or 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.5 mg/kg ) , respectively . The icv or the intraraphé administration of the serotonergic neurotoxin , 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine ( 5,7- DB02901 ) , slightly stimulated masculine sexual behaviour and produced a decrease in serotonin and its metabolite levels . In lesioned animals TFMPP ( 0.5 mg/kg ) resulted in an inhibitory effect reflected as a prolongation of the ejaculation latency . The inhibitory effect of this drug on mounting behaviour was not observed in 5,7- DB02901 treated rats . In lesioned animals 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.5 mg/kg ) produced the same facilitatory effect . Present data indicate that serotonergic postsynaptic receptors mediate both the inhibitory and the facilitatory actions of TFMPP or 8-OH-DPAT in copulation . All data further support the idea that endogenous serotonin acts via the stimulation of P28222 receptors to induce its inhibitory effects on masculine sexual behaviour . A comparison of the effects of 8-OH-DPAT pretreatment of different behavioural responses to 8-OH-DPAT . The effects of daily pretreatments with the prototypical P08908 receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) ( 1.0 mg/kg s.c. ) on behavioural responses to challenge by 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.5 mg/kg s.c. ) due to activation of P08908 receptors were determined . The responses had strikingly different susceptibilities to pretreatment . These were not explicable by different effects on pre- and postsynaptic responses . Thus , two components of the 5-HT syndrome due to action at postsynaptic sites ( i.e. flat body posture and reciprocal forepaw treading ) were substantially attenuated 1 day after a single pretreatment with 8-OH.DPAT , but the tail-flick response , though due to action at postsynaptic P08908 sites , was completely unimpaired by 14 pretreatments while the hypothermic response which also probably involves postsynaptic sites showed progressively increased attenuation on 14 pretreatments . 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperphagia which depends on activation of presynaptic sites was unimpaired by the pretreatment schedule . The results are discussed in relation to receptor reserve , second messenger changes and effects at DB01221 receptors . They imply a need for caution in the use of chronic effects of 5-HTergic drugs on specific P08908 receptor-dependent responses as indices of mechanisms for the therapeutic actions of the drugs . Serotonin transporter interacts with the PDGFβ receptor in DB00102 -induced signaling and mitogenesis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells . The serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) have been implicated in both clinical and experimental pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) and the facilitation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell ( PASMC ) growth . To gain a better understanding of the possible relationship of these two cell surface molecules we have explored interactions between P31645 and P09619 . We have previously demonstrated that P31645 transactivates PDGFRβ in serotonin-stimulated PASMC proliferation . We now provide evidence for a role for P31645 in DB00102 signaling and PASMC proliferation by using pharmacological inhibitors , genetic ablation , and construct overexpression of P31645 . The results show that four tested P31645 blockers dose dependently inhibit PDGF-stimulated human and bovine PASMC proliferation with comparable efficacy to that of P09619 inhibitors , whereas P28222 or 5- Q13049 receptor inhibitors had no effect . Combinations of the P31645 and P09619 inhibitors led to synergistic/additive inhibition . Similarly , PDGF-induced PASMC proliferation was attenuated by small interfering RNA downregulation of P31645 . Inhibition of P31645 in PASMCs attenuated PDGF-induced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ , Akt , and p38 but not Erk . Overexpression of P31645 in HEK293 cells led to enhanced Akt phosphorylation by PDGF , which was blunted by a P31645 PDZ motif mutant , indicating the mechanistic need for the PDZ motif of P31645 in PDGF signaling . Furthermore , coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that P31645 and PDGFRβ become physically associated upon PDGF stimulation . In total , the data show for the first time an important interactive relationship between P31645 and the PDGFRβ in the production of PASMC proliferation triggered by PDGF that may be important in PH . Effects of lurasidone on executive function in common marmosets . Cognitive impairment is one of the major symptoms of schizophrenia , and is considered largely due to dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) . DB08815 , a novel atypical antipsychotic agent with high binding affinity for dopamine D2 , serotonin P34969 , 5- Q13049 and P08908 receptors has been reported to have superior efficacy in rodents ' models of cognitive impairment . However , the beneficial effect of lurasidone on cognitive impairment has not been evaluated in non-human primates . In this study , we investigated the effect of lurasidone on executive function , which is one of the cognitive domains , in common marmosets and compared the results to those of other antipsychotics . The effects of lurasidone , haloperidol , olanzapine , risperidone , quetiapine and clozapine on executive function were evaluated in naïve marmosets using the object retrieval with detours ( ORD ) task . Before drug treatment , marmosets ' success rates in the easy trial of the test were almost 90 % . However , maximum success in the difficult trial of the task reached only 50 % after 8 days of training . DB00502 , olanzapine and risperidone decreased correct performance even in the easy trial of the task . All drugs , except lurasidone , impaired success rate in the difficult trial . On the other hand , lurasidone dose-dependently increased marmosets ' success rates in the difficult trial with significant effect at 10mg/kg . In conclusion , we have shown in this study that lurasidone , unlike conventional antipsychotics , improves cognition associated with executive function in common marmosets . These findings suggest that lurasidone would be more useful for treatment of schizophrenia cognitive impairment than other antipsychotics . Molecular response of HL-60 cells to mitotic inhibitors vincristine and taxol visualized with apoptosis-related gene expressions , including the new member Q9HB09 . DB01229 and vincristine belong to a group of anticancer drugs that target microtubules , subsequently arresting cells at the mitotic phase of the cell cycle and inducing programmed cell death . The P10415 ( bcl-2 ) family of genes is of known implication in apoptosis induced by various stimuli , among which Q9HB09 , a new member of the family , cloned by our group . For further insights into the mechanisms and molecular targets implicated and modified as a result of apoptosis induced by these two mitosis-arresting drugs , we studied the possible alterations , at the mRNA level , of various apoptosis-related genes ( P10415 , Q07812 , Q9HB09 , CASPASE-3 , FAS ) after leukemia cell ( HL-60 ) treatment with these drugs . The kinetics of cell toxicity were evaluated by the MTT [ 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ] method , trypan blue staining , and cell proliferation efficiency ; apoptosis induction was assayed by endonucleosomal cleavage of DNA ( DNA laddering ) ; and the expression levels of the genes were analysed by RT-PCR , using gene-specific primers . The percentage of nonviable cells was upregulated with increasing cell exposure time and drug concentrations to both taxol and vincristine . Distinct modulations of apoptosis-related genes at the mRNA level were also observed , mainly concerning P10415 and Q9HB09 along apoptosis induction . Our results indicate and support the hypothesis that the apoptosis-related genes P10415 and Q9HB09 respond similarly to treatment of the human , acute , myelocytic leukemia HL60 cells with the anticancer drugs vincristine and taxol though in a drug-specific and time-dependent manner . The effectiveness of lurasidone as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex in the treatment of bipolar disorder . The majority of patients with bipolar disorder spend a lot of time in depressive episodes that impose a great burden on patients , caregivers , and society and accounts for the largest part of the morbidity-mortality of the illness . DB08815 is an atypical antipsychotic with a potent binding affinity as antagonist for D2 , 5- Q13049 , P34969 , and partial agonist at P08908 receptors . Affinity for other receptors as H1 and muscarinic were negligible . DB08815 was approved in 2010 for the treatment of schizophrenia and recently , 2013 , for bipolar depression in monotherapy and an adjunct to lithium or valproate . Clinical trials have established that lurasidone adjuvant to lithium or valproate has more efficacy than the placebo and is associated with minimal weight gain and no clinically meaningful alterations in glucose , lipids , or the QT interval . Additional studies are desirable to know the clinical profile of lurasidone in long-term treatment , in patients with bipolar II disorders , and versus other antipsychotic agents . Constellation of HCN channels and DB02527 regulating proteins in dendritic spines of the primate prefrontal cortex : potential substrate for working memory deficits in schizophrenia . Schizophrenia associates with impaired prefrontal cortical ( P27918 ) function and alterations in cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) signaling pathways . These include genetic insults to disrupted-in-schizophrenia ( Q9NRI5 ) and phosphodiesterases ( PDE4s ) regulating DB02527 hydrolysis , and increased dopamine D1 receptor ( D1R ) expression that elevates DB02527 . We used immunoelectron microscopy to localize Q9NRI5 , P27815 , Q07343 , and D1R in monkey P27918 and to view spatial interactions with hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ( HCN ) channels that gate network inputs when opened by DB02527 . Physiological interactions between PDE4s and HCN channels were tested in recordings of P27918 neurons in monkeys performing a spatial working memory task . The study reveals a constellation of DB02527 -related proteins ( Q9NRI5 , P27815 , and D1R ) and HCN channels next to excitatory synapses and the spine neck in thin spines of superficial P27918 , where working memory microcircuits interconnect and spine loss is most evident in schizophrenia . In contrast , channels in dendrites were distant from synapses and DB02527 -related proteins , and were associated with endosomal trafficking . The data suggest that a DB02527 signalplex is selectively positioned in the spines to gate P27918 pyramidal cell microcircuits . Single-unit recordings confirmed physiological interactions between DB02527 and HCN channels , consistent with gating actions . These data may explain why P27918 networks are especially vulnerable to genetic insults that dysregulate DB02527 signaling .
The N-end rule pathway counteracts cell death by destroying proapoptotic protein fragments . In the course of apoptosis , activated caspases cleave ∼500 to ∼1,000 different proteins in a mammalian cell . The dynamics of apoptosis involve a number of previously identified , caspase-generated proapoptotic protein fragments , defined as those that increase the probability of apoptosis . In contrast to activated caspases , which can be counteracted by inhibitor of apoptosis proteins , there is little understanding of antiapoptotic responses to proapoptotic protein fragments . One possibility is the regulation of proapoptotic fragments through their selective degradation . The previously identified proapoptotic fragments DB00151 - Q13546 , DB00151 - Q13077 , DB00128 - P38398 , DB00149 - P53667 , DB00135 - Q14511 , DB00125 - P55957 , DB00128 -BCL(XL) , DB00125 - O43521 (EL) , DB00128 - P54764 , and DB00135 -MET bear destabilizing N-terminal residues . Tellingly , the destabilizing nature ( but not necessarily the actual identity ) of N-terminal residues of proapoptotic fragments was invariably conserved in evolution . Here , we show that these proapoptotic fragments are short-lived substrates of the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway . Metabolic stabilization of at least one such fragment , DB00151 - Q13546 , greatly augmented the activation of the apoptosis-inducing effector caspase-3 . In agreement with this understanding , even a partial ablation of the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway in two specific N-end rule mutants is shown to sensitize cells to apoptosis . We also found that caspases can inactivate components of the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway , suggesting a mutual suppression between this pathway and proapoptotic signaling . Together , these results identify a mechanistically specific and functionally broad antiapoptotic role of the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway . In conjunction with other apoptosis-suppressing circuits , the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway contributes to thresholds that prevent a transient or otherwise weak proapoptotic signal from reaching the point of commitment to apoptosis . Signaling cascade that mediates endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation induced by atrial natriuretic peptide . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) induces activation of nitric oxide-synthase ( NOS ) . AIMS : to identify the isoform of NOS involved in P01160 effects , to study whether P01160 modifies NOS expression and to investigate the signaling pathways and receptors involved in NOS stimulation . NOS activation induced by P01160 would be mediated by endothelial NOS ( P29474 ) since neuronal or inducible NOS inhibition did not alter P01160 effect . The peptide induced no changes in P29474 protein expression . NOS activity stimulated by P01160 , in the kidney , aorta and left ventricle , was partially abolished by the P16066 /B antagonist , as well as PKG inhibition , but no difference in atria was observed . 8-Br-cGMP partially mimicked the effect of P01160 on NOS in all tissues . NOS stimulation by P01160 in atria disappeared when G protein was inhibited , but this effect was partial in the other tissues . P62158 antagonist abolished NOS stimulation via P01160 . Inhibition of the P98160 , PKC or P19957 kinase/Akt pathway failed to alter NOS activation induced by P01160 . P01160 would activate P29474 in the aorta , heart and kidney without modifying the expression of the enzyme . P01160 would interact with P17342 coupled via G proteins leading to the activation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent NOS in atria ; while in ventricle , aorta and kidney , P01160 could also interact with P16066 /B , increasing cGMP , which in turns activates PKG to stimulate P29474 . DB04958 , a humanized anti- P20273 antibody , in aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma : phase I/II clinical trial results . PURPOSE : We conducted a single-center , dose-escalation study evaluating the safety , pharmacokinetics , and efficacy of epratuzumab , an anti- P20273 humanized monoclonal antibody , in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : DB04958 was administered once weekly for 4 weeks at 120-1000-mg/m2 doses to 56 patients [ most ( n = 35 ) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ] . RESULTS : Patients were heavily pretreated ( median , 4 prior therapies ) , 25 % received prior high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant , and 84 % had bulky disease ( > or =5 cm ) . DB04958 was well tolerated , with no dose-limiting toxicity . Most ( 95 % ) infusions were completed within 1 h . The mean serum half-life was 23.9 days . Across all dose levels and histologies , objective responses ( ORs ) were observed in five patients ( 10 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 3-21 % ) , including three complete responses . In patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , 15 % had ORs . Overall , 11 ( 20 % ) patients experienced some tumor mass reduction . Median duration of OR was 26.3 weeks , and median time to progression for responders was 35 weeks . Two responses are ongoing at > or =34 months , including one rituximab-refractory patient . CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that epratuzumab has a good safety profile and exerts antitumor activity in aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma at doses of > or =240 mg/m2 , thus warranting further evaluation in this clinical setting . Altered regulation of renal nitric oxide , atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclooxygenase systems in aldosterone escape in rats . The present study was aimed to determine whether there is an altered role of local nitric oxide ( NO ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) systems in the kidney in association with the aldosterone escape . Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used . DB04630 ( 200 microg/day ) was infused through entire time course . The control group was kept on a low sodium diet ( 0.02 mEq/day ) , and the experimental group was supplied with a higher sodium diet ( 2. /day ) . Four days after beginning the regimen , the kidneys were taken . The protein expression of NO synthase ( NOS ) and P36551 isoforms was determined by semiquantitative immunoblotting . The mRNA expression of components of P01160 system was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction . The activities of soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclases were determined by the amount of cGMP generated in responses to sodium nitroprusside and P01160 , respectively . There developed aldosterone escape in the experimental group . Accordingly , the renal content and the urinary excretion of NO increased . The expression of P29475 was increased in the inner medulla . Neither the expression of P29474 nor that of P35228 was changed . The expression and the catalytic activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase remained unaltered . The mRNA expression of P01160 was increased . Neither the expression of P16066 or P17342 nor the activity of particulate guanylyl cyclase was altered in the papilla . The protein expression of P35354 was increased in the inner medulla , while that of P23219 remained unchanged . In conclusion , the upregulation of P29475 , P01160 , and P35354 may be causally related with the aldosterone escape . DB01645 potentiates the P01160 effect on a K(+)-conductance in P29320 -293 cells . P29320 -293 cells are known to reflect many features of the late distal tubule . Furthermore , they have the ability to release urodilatin , the structural analog to P01160 . RT-PCR was performed to test for the expression of natriuretic peptide receptors . While the mRNA for the human P01160 receptor ( P16066 , P16066 ) could be amplified , the P09543 -specific receptor P20594 ( P20594 ) and the receptor specific for guanylins , P25092 , could not be detected . In patch clamp experiments the effects of P01160 ( 10 nM ) on membrane voltage ( V(m) ) were monitored and P29320 -293 cells depolarized by 2.3 +/- 0.5 mV ( n=14 ) . In the presence of the P01133 receptor blocker genistein ( 10 microM ) the effect of P01160 was increased by 65 % to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mV ( n=14 ) . After removal of genistein the P01160 -mediated depolarization further increased by 147 % to 5.7 +/- 1.0 mV ( n=14 ) . P01160 given repetitively without genistein had no increasing depolarizing effect in P29320 -293 cells with time . The P01160 effect could be fully blocked by 1 mM Ba(2+) and by 1 microM of the specific PKG inhibitor KT5823 indicating that P01160 inhibits a K(+)-conductance via a cGMP-dependent protein kinase . DB01645 itself hyperpolarized the membrane voltage of P29320 -293 cells by -3.9 +/- 0.6 mV ( n=11 ) and this effect could also be fully blocked by Ba(2+) ( -0.3 +/- 0.1 mV , n=5 ) , indicating that genistein activates a K(+)-conductance which contributes significantly to the membrane potential of P29320 -293 cells . Clinical development of eniluracil : current status . DB03516 is a potent inactivator of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( Q12882 ) , which is the first enzyme in the degradative pathway of systemically administered 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) . Two completely oral regimens of eniluracil plus DB00544 are being evaluated in clinical trials : ( 1 ) a chronic schedule with both agents administered P55957 in a 10:1 ratio for 28 days of a 5-week course , and ( 2 ) a 5-day schedule of eniluracil once daily on days 1 through 7 and DB00544 once daily on days 2 through 6 . The clinical development of eniluracil is being pursued in several tumor types , including colorectal cancer , breast cancer , and pancreatic cancer . Response rates achieved in a phase II study of the chronic schedule of oral eniluracil/ DB00544 in patients with colorectal cancer compare favorably with those obtained in trials of intravenous DB00544 and leucovorin , while results from other trials are awaited . Safety analysis for the 28-day schedule has revealed a low incidence of severe toxicities , particularly as compared with standard DB00544 regimens . The cloning and reintroduction into animal cells of a functional CAD gene , a dominant amplifiable genetic marker . Rodent cells resistant to DB03459 , a specific inhibitor of the aspartate transcarbamylase activity of the multifunctional P27708 , overproduce CAD as a result of amplification of the CAD gene . We cloned a functional CAD gene from Syrian hamster cells using a cosmid vector . Two independently isolated cosmids containing CAD genes have inserts 40 and 45 kb long . We introduced the cloned genes into CAD-deficient Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell mutants by fusing them with protoplasts of Escherichia coli containing the cosmids . We also introduced the cloned genes into wild-type CHO cells by selecting cells that became resistant to high concentrations of DB03459 following protoplast fusion . The transformants of the mutant and wild-type CHO cells contain multiple active copies of the donated Syrian hamster CAD genes . The cloned genes in three independent transformants are integrated into host-cell chromosomes at single locations identified by in situ hybridization . In two of these transformants , the genes are located in one X chromosome or in a chromosome resembling the X . In the third case , the genes are located in a small metacentric or rearranged chromosome . Characterization of the StcE protease activity of Escherichia coli O157:H7 . The StcE zinc metalloprotease is secreted by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ) O157:H7 and contributes to intimate adherence of this bacterium to host cells , a process essential for mammalian colonization . StcE has also been shown to localize the inflammatory regulator P05155 ( DB05341 ) to cell membranes . We tried to more fully characterize StcE activity to better understand its role in EHEC pathogenesis . StcE was active at pH 6.1 to 9.0 , in the presence of NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 600 mM , and at 4 degrees C to 55 degrees C . Interestingly , antisera against StcE or DB05341 did not eliminate StcE cleavage of DB05341 . Treatment of StcE with the proteases trypsin , chymotrypsin , human neutrophil elastase , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase did not eliminate StcE activity against DB05341 . After StcE was kept at 23 degrees C for 65 days , it exhibited full proteolytic activity , and it retained 30 % of its original activity after incubation for 8 days at 37 degrees C . Together , these results show the StcE protease is a stable enzyme that is probably active in the environment of the colon . Additionally , k(cat)/K(m) data showed that StcE proteolytic activity was 2.5-fold more efficient with the secreted mucin Q8TAX7 than with the complement regulator DB05341 . This evidence supports a model which includes two roles for StcE during infection , in which StcE acts first as a mucinase and then as an anti-inflammatory agent by localizing DB05341 to cell membranes . Glucocorticoid-induced surface expression of annexin 1 blocks beta2-integrin adhesion of human eosinophils to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 surrogate protein . BACKGROUND : Glucocorticoids attenuate the population of eosinophils and T lymphocytes in asthmatic airways . The decrease in airway eosinophilia is caused both by accelerated cell death and by induction of blockade of integrin adhesion . In this study , we examined the hypothesis that annexin 1 surface expression , which is upregulated by the glucocorticoid receptor , prevents integrin adhesion essential to cell migration by blocking intracellular translocation of cytosolic group IV phospholipase A2 ( P47712 ) . OBJECTIVE : To examine the relationship of the glucocorticoid on annexin 1 expression and the effect of blockade of annexin 1 activity on adhesion of human eosinophils in vitro . To determine the relationship between annexin 1surface expression and nuclear membrane translocation of P47712 . METHODS : Eosinophils isolated from human peripheral blood were pretreated with fluticasone propionate ( FP ) , and beta2-integrin adhesion was measured after stimulation with P05113 or eotaxin . Effects of FP on P47712 expression , phosphorylation , and translocation were determined . The role of annexin 1 was examined by using annexin 1 blocking antibody and/or mimetic peptides . RESULTS : DB00588 decreased stimulated eosinophil adhesion and caused 4-fold increase in annexin 1 expression on the plasma membrane . Inhibition of adhesion by FP was blocked with annexin 1 blocking antibody . Annexin 1 N-terminal mimetic peptide also blocked beta2-integrin adhesion . Translocation of P47712 to the nuclear membrane was significantly blocked by incubation with FP . Blockade was reversed with annexin 1 blocking antibody . CONCLUSION : Blockade of beta2-integrin adhesion by glucocorticoid is regulated by annexin 1 , which blocks P47712 translocation to nuclear membrane . Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 mitogen-activated protein kinases inhibit atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA transcription in P40189 -mediated hypertrophic ventricular myocytes . OBJECTIVE : To understand the role of P01160 mRNA transcription regulation in P40189 -mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , and the involved mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) -extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 , also called Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK ) signaling pathway . METHODS : Isolated neonatal ventricular myocytes were treated with different concentrations of Q16619 ( 10(-9) , 10(-8)and 10(-7)mol/L ) . MTT was used to analyze the viability and RT-PCR was used to detect P01160 mRNA levels in cardiomyocyte . To inhibit Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK activity in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes , the cells were pretreated with a specific Q02750 inhibitor . RESULTS : Q16619 significantly induced P01160 mRNA expression and the viability of cardiomyocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Furthermore , blocking Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK activity by the special Q02750 inhibitor upregulated the P01160 mRNA . CONCLUSIONS : Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK have an important role in suppressing P01160 mRNA transcription and cell activity in P40189 -mediated hypertrophic ventricular myocytes . Functional analysis of human Q8TAX7 mucin gene 5'-flanking region in lung epithelial cells . The human Q8TAX7 gene encodes a low-molecular-mass mucin glycoprotein that functions in modulation of microbial flora in the oral cavity and respiratory tracts . Q8TAX7 gene expression is tissue- and cell-specific , with dominant expression in salivary gland acinar cells . To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for controlling Q8TAX7 gene expression , we analyzed the promoter activity of Q8TAX7 5'-flanking region in a human lung epithelial cell line A549 . We demonstrated that Q8TAX7 gene is expressed constitutively in this cell line and is upregulated by P01375 stimulation . The promoter activities of a 2,762-bp fragment of the human genomic DNA ( -2,732/+30 bp ) and its deletion series , subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector , were characterized at the basal level and under stimulation by P01375 . The results indicated that the minimal functional Q8TAX7 promoter is in the region of -138/+30 bp . This region also revealed the greatest increase in the promoter activity upon P01375 stimulation . Two putative P05412 -binding elements and one NF-kappaB-binding element were identified within the proximal promoter . Further analyses demonstrated that mutations of these elements dramatically reduced specific DNA-protein binding ability and reporter gene expression . P05412 elements played an essential role in the constitutive expression , while the NF-kappaB element was crucially important in the response to P01375 stimulation , demonstrating that P01375 activates Q8TAX7 transcription via NF-kappaB signaling pathway . Neuronal influence behind the central nervous system regulation of the immune cells . Central nervous system ( CNS ) has a highly specialized microenvironment , and despite being initially considered an immune privileged site , this immune status is far from absolute because it varies with age and brain topography . The brain monitors immune responses by several means that act in parallel ; one pathway involves afferent nerves ( vagal nerve ) and the other resident cells ( neurons and glia ) . These cell populations exert a strong role in the regulation of the immune system , favoring an immune-modulatory environment in the CNS . Neurons control glial cell and infiltrated T-cells by contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms . Contact-dependent mechanisms are provided by several membrane immune modulating molecules such as Sema-7A , P48023 , P20273 , P41217 , Q08722 , P13591 , Q9UMF0 , and cadherins ; which can inhibit the expression of microglial inflammatory cytokines , induce apoptosis or inactivate infiltrated T-cells . On the other hand , soluble neuronal factors like Sema-3A , cytokines , neurotrophins , neuropeptides , and neurotransmitters attenuate microglial and/or T-cell activation . In this review , we focused on all known mechanism driven only by neurons in order to control the local immune cells . DB01373 /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II increases glutamate and noradrenaline release from synaptosomes . A variety of evidence indicates that calcium-dependent protein phosphorylation modulates the release of neurotransmitter from nerve terminals . For instance , the injection of rat calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II ) into the preterminal digit of the squid giant synapse leads to an increase in the release of a so-far unidentified neurotransmitter induced by presynaptic depolarization . But until now , it has not been demonstrated that Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II can also regulate neurotransmitter release in the vertebrate nervous system . Here we report that the introduction of Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II , autoactivated by thiophosphorylation , into rat brain synaptosomes ( isolated nerve terminals ) increases the initial rate of induced release of two neurotransmitters , glutamate and noradrenaline . We also show that introduction of a selective peptidergic inhibitor of Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II inhibits the initial rate of induced glutamate release . These results support the hypothesis that activation of Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II in the nerve terminal removes a constraint on neurotransmitter release . Immunohistochemical analysis in ethinylestradiol-treated breast cancers after prior long-term estrogen-deprivation therapy . BACKGROUND : P03372 ( ER ) positive breast cancer can often be treated by hormone therapy ; however a certain population of ER-positive patients become resistant to hormone therapy after long-term hormone treatment . DB00977 ( EE2 ) is a derivative of estrogen , which has shown promising effects in these patients . METHODS : We successfully obtained tissue samples from 6 patients undergoing EE2 treatment and examined 13 well-known breast cancer-related factors by immunohistochemistry . Of the 6 patients , 5 responded but one patient did not . RESULTS : Before EE2 treatment , staining for both ER and androgen receptor ( AR ) was strong in the nucleus , and the progesterone receptor ( PgR ) was almost no staining . EE2 treatment significantly down-regulated ER and up-regulated PgR while nuclear and cytosolic AR were oppositely down- and up-regulated , respectively . Cytosolic staining of P38398 was significantly up-regulated by EE2 whereas nuclear staining tended to decrease . Individual comparisons suggested less induction of PgR and decreasing AKT but increasing pAKT in the non-responder following EE2 treatment . CONCLUSIONS : Our observations revealed that EE2 activated ER downstream genes ; however it did not stimulate cell growth . This suggests that hormone resistant cells might receive growth signals from a non-genomic pathway and this may be reflected in their sensitivity to EE2 treatment . Vampire bat plasminogen activator DB04925 -alpha-1 ( desmoteplase ) : a thrombolytic drug optimized by natural selection . P00747 activators are enzymes found in all vertebrate species investigated so far . Their physiological function is the generation of localized proteolysis in the context of tissue remodeling , wound healing and neuronal plasticity . The common vampire bat ( Desmodus rotundus ) is a New World species that feeds exclusively on blood . Its saliva contains highly potent plasminogen activators , specialized in rapid lysis of fresh blood clots . Biochemical and pharmacological evidence indicates that these plasminogen activators represent a new class of thrombolytics with pharmacological and toxicological properties superior to human tissue-type plasminogen activator , the clot dissolving agent now most frequently used in medicine . A form of the enzyme produced by recombinant DNA technology is currently employed to test this hypothesis in clinical studies . [ Level of neuropeptide Y in serum of patients with chronic congestive heart failure ] . The purpose of the study was to measure plasma concentrations of neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) , endothelin-1,2 ( ET-1,2 ) , alpha atrial natriuretic polypeptide ( P01160 ) and noradrenaline ( NA ) in relation to cardiac index ( CI ) and left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) in patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . There were significant increases in venous blood concentrations of P01303 , Na , ET-1,2 , P01160 in the patients with CHF . Plasma concentrations of P01303 correlated with plasma NA concentrations but plasma noradrenaline concentrations alone correlated with CI and LVEF . In patients with CHF plasma NA concentrations seems to be more sensitive index of cardiac dysfunction then the concentrations of neuropeptide Y . Differential display RT-PCR reveals genes associated with lithium-induced neuritogenesis in SK-N-MC cells . DB01356 is shown to be neurotrophic and protective against variety of environmental stresses both in vitro as well as in vivo . In view of the wider clinical applications , it is necessary to examine alterations in levels of expression of genes affected by lithium . DB01356 induces neuritogenesis in human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC . Our aim was to elucidate genes involved in lithium-induced neuritogenesis using SK-N-MC cells . The differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( DD-RT-PCR ) technique was used to study gene expression profiles in SK-N-MC cells undergoing lithium-induced neuritogenesis . Differential expression of genes in control and lithium ( 2.5 mM , 24 h ) -treated cells was compared by display of cDNAs generated by reverse transcription of mRNA followed by PCR using arbitrary primers . Expression of four genes was altered in lithium-treated cells . Real-time PCR was done to confirm the levels of expression of each of these genes using specific primers . DB01356 significantly up-regulated P13591 , a molecule known to stimulate neuritogenesis , occludin , a molecule participating in tight junctions and PKD2 , a molecule known to modulate calcium transport . P01160 32c , a gene whose function is not fully known yet , was found to be down-regulated by lithium . This is the first report demonstrating altered levels of expression of these genes in lithium-induced neuritogenesis and contributes four hitherto unreported candidates possibly involved in the process . Estrogenic chemicals at puberty change ERalpha in the hypothalamus of male and female rats . The effects of two environmental endocrine disruptors , the synthetic pharmaceutical estrogen DB00977 ( EE ) and bisphenol-A ( Q03001 ) , were analysed in male and female rats in a very sensitive developmental period , puberty . Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate changes in the number of cells expressing estrogen receptors ( P03372 ) in the arcuate nucleus ( ARC ) , ventromedial nucleus ( VMH ) and medial preoptic area ( DB00603 ) of the hypothalamus . Animals were treated during early puberty , from P01160 23 to P01160 30 , with EE and Q03001 given orally every day . They were then sacrificed and perfused on P01160 37 or P01160 90 , and blood and brains were collected for hormonal determination ( testosterone and estradiol ) and immunohistochemistry ( estrogen receptors , ER ) . At P01160 37 , ER-labelled neurons were higher in males than in females in the ARC and DB00603 . EE and Q03001 increased ER-labelled neurons in the ARC and DB00603 . At P01160 90 , females showed higher ER-labelled neurons in the VMH . EE and Q03001 increased ER-labelled neurons in the DB00603 in females . EE increased testosterone in males at P01160 37 and estradiol in females at P01160 90 . These results indicate the ability of estrogenic chemicals to change the reproductive neural circuits during puberty in male and female rats . Isolation and characterization of P62333 . A novel ATPase family component of the yeast 26 S proteasome . Using a genetic strategy designed to find proteins involved in the function of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional activator GAL4 , we isolated mutants in two genes which rescue a class of gal4 activation domain mutants . One of these genes , P62195 , encodes a member of a large family of putative ATPases , the Conserved ATPase containing Domain ( CAD ) proteins ( also known as AAA proteins ) that are involved in a wide variety of cellular functions . Subsequently , P62195 was identified as a subunit of the 26 S proteasome . We have now cloned the gene defined by the second complementation group . P62333 encodes an essential 49-kDa protein that is also a member of the CAD family and is 43 % identical to P62195 . The mutation in sug2-1 , like that in sug1-1 , is found in the CAD near the highly conserved ATPase motif . We present biochemical and genetic evidence that P62333 is associated in vivo with P62195 and is a novel P27708 subunit of the 26 S proteasome . With its highly conserved mammalian homologs , human Q8NFH3 and ground squirrel CADp44 , P62333 defines a new class of proteasomal CAD proteins . The response of striatal neuropeptide Y and cholinergic neurons to excitatory amino acid agonists . The effect of excitatory amino acid antagonists on antagonist on neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) and cholinergic neurons in the striatum of the rat was studied by means of P01303 immunocytochemistry , DB00677 histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , and biochemical determinations of choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) . Intrastriatal infusion of drugs revealed that striatal neurons containing P01303 are more sensitive than cholinergic neurons to the neurotoxic actions of kainic acid ( KA ) , quinolinic acid ( QA ) and L-glutamic acid ( GA ) ; all 3 compounds produced a marked loss of P01303 neurons , but only a moderate decrease in the number of P22303 neurons or P28329 activity . Co-injection experiments showed that the neurotoxicity of QA and GA , but not that of KA , can be antagonized by the specific N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor antagonist 3-((+/-)-2-(carboxypiperazine-4-yl))-propyl-1-phosphonic acid ( CPP ) . Destruction of the glutamatergic corticostriatal projection by cerebral decortication protected striatal P01303 and cholinergic neurons against KA neurotoxicity . These results indicate that striatal P01303 and cholinergic neurons receive prominent cortical amino acid afferents , and that the neurotoxic effect of QA and GA on these neurons is mediated through DB01221 receptors . Rationalizing cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibition for maximal efficacy and minimal adverse events . New information indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) is constitutively expressed in several tissues , including brain , lung , pancreas , kidney , and ovary , and plays an important role in renal and gastrointestinal function . Selective P35354 inhibition has been associated in animal studies with impairment of ulcer healing and renal function and inhibition of prostacyclin , an effect that inhibits vasodilation without inhibiting platelet aggregation . The clinical consequences , if any , of these effects remain to be determined in long-term studies in humans . The premise that selective P35354 inhibitors will cause less gastrointestinal toxicity than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that inhibit both P36551 isoforms needs to take into account the low toxicity of nabumetone . The gastrointestinal safety profile of this nonacidic , dual P36551 inhibitor that does not undergo enterohepatic circulation has been evaluated in extensive clinical trials . The data submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration in the New Drug Application for nabumetone ( DB00461 ) , the comparative trials subsequently completed , the published databases of the comparative gastrointestinal toxicity of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , and the meta-analysis published in this issue of The American Journal of Medicine ( Schoenfeld , page 48S ) indicate that nabumetone has the lowest incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity among the extensively studied NSAIDs . Overall , the incidence is approximately 10-fold less than with comparator drugs . This rate is an appropriate current reference against which the gastrointestinal toxicity of P35354 inhibitors can be compared . Encapsulation of viral vectors for gene therapy applications . In gene therapy , a number of viruses are currently being used as vectors to provide transient expression of therapeutic proteins . A drawback of using free virus is that it gives a potent immune response , which reduces gene transfer and limits re-administration . An alternative delivery system is to encapsulate the virus in poly(lactide-co-glycolide) ( P00747 ) microspheres prior to administration . A recombinant adenovirus ( Ad ) expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was used to test the transduction efficiency of Ad encapsulated in microspheres on target cells . The number of infected cells that expressed GFP was measured by flow cytometry . It was demonstrated that encapsulated viral vectors could successfully transduce target cells with encapsulation efficiencies up to 23 % and that the level of transduction could be controlled by varying both the quantity of microspheres and the amount of Ad in the microspheres . High transduction efficiencies and its recognized biocompatibility make P00747 -encapsulated Ad an attractive alternative to the use of free virus in gene therapy applications . The infectivity of Ad was found to be significantly influenced by the processing conditions and changes in environmental factors . Free Ad and encapsulated Ad were able to infect both E1 complimenting cells ( P29320 293 ) and non-complimenting cells ( A549 ) , with the viral expression in P29320 293 cells being 2.1 times greater than for A549 cells . Prevention of airway inflammation with topical cream containing imiquimod and small interfering RNA for natriuretic peptide receptor . BACKGROUND : Asthma is a complex disease , characterized by reversible airway obstruction , hyperresponsiveness and chronic inflammation . Principle pharmacologic treatments for asthma include bronchodilating beta2-agonists and anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroids ; but these agents do not target the main cause of the disease , the generation of pathogenic Th2 cells . We previously reported reduction in allergic inflammation in mice deficient in the P01160 receptor NPRA . Here we determined whether siRNA for natriuretic peptide receptor A ( siNPRA ) protected against asthma when administered transdermally . METHODS : Imiquimod cream mixed with chitosan nanoparticles containing either siRNA green indicator ( siGLO ) or siNPRA was applied to the skin of mice . Delivery of siGLO was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy . The anti-inflammatory activity of transdermal siNPRA was tested in OVA-sensitized mice by measuring airway hyperresponsiveness , eosinophilia , lung histopathology and pro-inflammatory cytokines . RESULTS : SiGLO appearing in the lung proved the feasibility of transdermal delivery . In a mouse asthma model , BALB/c mice treated with imiquimod cream containing siNPRA chitosan nanoparticles showed significantly reduced airway hyperresponsiveness , eosinophilia , lung histopathology and pro-inflammatory cytokines P05112 and P05113 in lung homogenates compared to controls . CONCLUSION : These results demonstrate that topical cream containing imiquimod and siNPRA nanoparticles exerts an anti-inflammatory effect and may provide a new and simple therapy for asthma . Molecular targets and regulators of cardiac hypertrophy . Cardiac hypertrophy is one of the main ways in which cardiomyocytes respond to mechanical and neurohormonal stimuli . It enables myocytes to increase their work output , which improves cardiac pump function . Although cardiac hypertrophy may initially represent an adaptive response of the myocardium , ultimately , it often progresses to ventricular dilatation and heart failure which is one of the leading causes of mortality in the western world . A number of signaling modulators that influence gene expression , apoptosis , cytokine release and growth factor signaling , etc. are known to regulate heart . By using genetic and cellular models of cardiac hypertrophy it has been proved that pathological hypertrophy can be prevented or reversed . This finding has promoted an enormous drive to identify novel and specific regulators of hypertrophy . In this review , we have discussed the various molecular signal transduction pathways and the regulators of hypertrophic response which includes calcineurin , cGMP , NFAT , natriuretic peptides , histone deacetylase , P05231 cytokine family , Gq/ P49842 signaling , PI3K , MAPK pathways , Na/H exchanger , DB01367 , polypeptide growth factors , P01160 , NO , P01375 , Q07869 and JAK/ P35610 pathway , microRNA , Cardiac angiogenesis and gene mutations in adult heart . Augmented knowledge of these signaling pathways and their interactions may potentially be translated into pharmacological therapies for the treatment of various cardiac diseases that are adversely affected by hypertrophy . The purpose of this review is to provide the current knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy , with special emphasis on novel researches and investigations .
DB00642 : mRNA expression of the target genes TS , GARFT and P00374 correlates with the in vitro chemosensitivity of human solid tumors . Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm : a method for developing classification structure-activity relationships . Classification methods allow for the development of structure-activity relationship models when the target property is categorical rather than continuous . We describe a classification method which fits descriptor splines to activities , with descriptors selected using a genetic algorithm . This method , which we identify as SFGA , is compared to the well-established techniques of recursive partitioning ( RP ) and soft independent modeling by class analogy ( SIMCA ) using five series of compounds : cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors , benzodiazepine receptor ( BZR ) ligands , estrogen receptor ( ER ) ligands , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitors , and monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors . Only 1-D and 2-D descriptors were used . Approximately 40 % of compounds in each series were assigned to a test set , " cherry-picked " from the complete set such that they lie outside the training set as much as possible . SFGA produced models that were more predictive for all but the P00374 set , for which SIMCA was most predictive . RP gave the least predictive models for all but the MAO set . A similar trend was observed when using training and test sets to which compounds were randomly assigned and when gradually eliminating compounds from the ( designed ) training set . The stability of models was examined for the random and reduced sets , where stability means that classification statistics and the selected descriptors are similar for models derived from different sets . Here , SIMCA produced the most stable models , followed by SFGA and RP . We show that a consensus approach that combines all three methods outperforms the single best model for all data sets . Integrative analysis of transcriptomics , proteomics , and metabolomics data of white adipose and liver tissue of high-fat diet and rosiglitazone-treated insulin-resistant mice identified pathway alterations and molecular hubs . The incidences of obesity and type 2 diabetes are rapidly increasing and have evolved into a global epidemic . In this study , we analyzed the molecular effects of high-fat diet ( HFD ) -induced insulin-resistance on mice in two metabolic target tissues , the white adipose tissue ( WAT ) and the liver . Additionally , we analyzed the effects of drug treatment using the specific PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone . We integrated transcriptome , proteome , and metabolome data sets for a combined holistic view of molecular mechanisms in type 2 diabetes . Using network and pathway analyses , we identified hub proteins such as P21912 and P53597 in WAT and deregulation of major metabolic pathways in the insulin-resistant state , including the TCA cycle , oxidative phosphorylation , and branched chain amino acid metabolism . Rosiglitazone treatment resulted mainly in modulation via Q07869 signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in WAT only . Interestingly , in HFD liver , we could observe a decrease of proteins involved in vitamin B metabolism such as Q6P996 and P00374 and the according metabolites . Furthermore , we could identify sphingosine ( Sph ) and sphingosine 1-phosphate ( SP1 ) as a drug-specific marker pair in the liver . In summary , our data indicate physiological plasticity gained by interconnected molecular pathways to counteract metabolic dysregulation due to high calorie intake and drug treatment . The anti-inflammatory drug BAY 11-7082 suppresses the MyD88-dependent signalling network by targeting the ubiquitin system . The compound BAY 11-7082 inhibits IκBα [ inhibitor of NF-κB ( nuclear factor κB ) α ] phosphorylation in cells and has been used to implicate the canonical IKKs ( IκB kinases ) and NF-κB in > 350 publications . In the present study we report that BAY 11-7082 does not inhibit the IKKs , but suppresses their activation in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated RAW macrophages and IL (interleukin)-1-stimulated IL-1R ( IL-1 receptor ) P29320 ( human embryonic kidney ) -293 cells . BAY 11-7082 exerts these effects by inactivating the E2-conjugating enzymes Ubc ( ubiquitin conjugating ) 13 and P68036 and the E3 ligase LUBAC ( linear ubiquitin assembly complex ) , thereby preventing the formation of Lys63-linked and linear polyubiquitin chains . BAY 11-7082 prevents ubiquitin conjugation to P61088 and P68036 by forming a covalent adduct with their reactive cysteine residues via Michael addition at the P01024 atom of BAY 11-7082 , followed by the release of 4-methylbenzene-sulfinic acid . BAY 11-7082 stimulated Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain formation in cells and protected HIF1α ( hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ) from proteasomal degradation , suggesting that it inhibits the proteasome . The results of the present study indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of BAY 11-7082 , its ability to induce B-cell lymphoma and leukaemic T-cell death and to prevent the recruitment of proteins to sites of DNA damage are exerted via inhibition of components of the ubiquitin system and not by inhibiting NF-κB . P15941 in macrophage : contributions to cigarette smoke-induced lung cancer . Expression of the pro-oncogenic mucin P15941 is elevated by inflammation in airway epithelial cells , but the contributions of P15941 to the development of lung cancer are uncertain . In this study , we developed our finding that cigarette smoke increases Muc1 expression in mouse lung macrophages , where we hypothesized P15941 may contribute to cigarette smoke-induced transformation of bronchial epithelial cells . In human macrophages , cigarette smoke extract ( CSE ) strongly induced P15941 expression through a mechanism involving the nuclear receptor Q07869 -γ . CSE-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) activation was also required for P15941 expression , but it had little effect on P15941 transcription . RNA interference-mediated attenuation of P15941 suppressed CSE-induced secretion of P01375 -α from macrophages , by suppressing the activity of the P01375 -α-converting enzyme ( P78536 ) , arguing that P15941 is required for CSE-induced and P78536 -mediated P01375 -α secretion . Similarly , P15941 blockade after CSE induction through suppression of Q07869 -γ or P29323 inhibited P78536 activity and P01375 -α secretion . Conditioned media from CSE-treated macrophages induced P15941 expression and potentiated CSE-induced transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells in a P01375 -α-dependent manner . Together , our results identify a signaling pathway involving Q07869 -γ , P29323 , and P15941 for P01375 -α secretion induced by CSE from macrophages . Furthermore , our results show how P15941 contributes to smoking-induced lung cancers that are driven by inflammatory signals from macrophages . Regulation of hepatic ApoC3 expression by P20142 -1β mediates hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) γ coactivator-1β ( P20142 -1β ) is a transcriptional coactivator that induces hypertriglyceridemia in response to dietary fats through activating hepatic lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion . The expression of P20142 -1β is regulated by free fatty acids . Here we show that P20142 -1β regulates plasma triglyceride metabolism through stimulating apolipoprotein P01024 ( P02656 ) expression and elevating P02656 levels in circulation . Remarkably , liver-specific knockdown of P02656 significantly ameliorates P20142 -1β-induced hypertriglyceridemia in mice . Hepatic expression of P20142 -1β and P02656 is reduced in response to acute and chronic treatments with nicotinic acid , a widely prescribed drug for lowering plasma triglycerides . Adenoviral-mediated knockdown of P20142 -1β or P02656 in the liver recapitulates the hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid . Proteomic analysis of hepatic P20142 -1β transcriptional complex indicates that it stimulates P02656 expression through coactivating orphan nuclear receptor ERRα and recruiting chromatin-remodeling cofactors . Together , these studies identify P20142 -1β as an important regulator of the P02656 gene cluster and reveal a mechanism through which nicotinic acid achieves its therapeutic effects . Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer 's disease : chemokines produced by astrocytes and chemokine receptors . Chemokines secreted by astrocytes play multiple roles in the pathology of Alzheimer 's disease , a chronic inflammation disorder of central nervous system . The level of chemokines in serum , cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue and their receptors both significantly changed in patients with Alzheimer 's disease . In this review , we briefly summarized the involvement of astrocytes and chemokines in Alzheimer 's disease , and the role of chemokine/chemokine receptors in the occurrence and development of Alzheimer 's disease . Clarification of the involvement of chemokines and their receptors , such as P13500 / P41597 , fractalkine/ P49238 , SDF-1α/ P61073 , MIP-1α/ P51681 , P02778 / P49682 , P10145 / P25024 , P25025 , and RANTES/ P32246 , P51677 , P51681 , will provide a new strategy and more specific targets for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease . IL-1 transcriptionally activates the neutrophil chemotactic factor/ P10145 gene in endothelial cells . Leucocytes and vascular cells interact closely in inflammation and immunity and cytokines are important mediators of this interaction . The present study was designed to define the capacity of human endothelial cells ( O14777 ) to produce a monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor ( provisionally termed P10145 ) . P10145 is a polypeptide chemotactic for neutrophils originally identified in the culture supernatant of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated monocytes . IL-1 induced high levels of production of neutrophil chemotactic activity in culture supernatants of O14777 . Optimal stimulation of activity was observed when O14777 were cultured with 10-100 ng/ml P01584 for 16 hr . Anti- P10145 antibody blocked the chemotactic activity for neutrophils of IL-1-activated O14777 supernatants . IL-1-treated O14777 expressed high levels of P10145 mRNA transcripts , as assessed by Northern blot analysis . Tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and LPS , unlike the inflammatory monokine P05231 , also induced P10145 expression . Nuclear run-off experiments revealed that IL-1 activated transcription of the P10145 gene . The production of P10145 may represent a mechanism whereby endothelial cells , exposed to inflammatory signals , participate in the regulation of neutrophil extravasation . Autologous P15941 -specific Th1 effector cell immunotherapy induces differential levels of systemic TReg cell subpopulations that result in increased ovarian cancer patient survival . Adoptive T cell immunotherapy using autologous lymphocytes is a viable treatment for patients with cancer and requires participation of Ag-specific P01730 and CD8 T cells . Here , we assessed the immunotherapeutic effects of autologous P15941 peptide-stimulated P01730 (+) effector cells following adoptive transfer in patients with ovarian cancer . Using P15941 peptide and P60568 for ex vivo P01730 (+)/Th1 effector cell generation , we show that three monthly treatment cycles of peripheral blood T cell restimulation and intraperitoneal re-infusion selectively modulated endogenous T cell-mediated immune responses that correlated with diminished serum Q8WXI7 tumor marker levels and enhanced patient survival . One patient remains disease-free , another patient survived long-term for nearly 16 months with recurrent disease and two patients expired within 3-5 months following final infusion . Although PBL from all patients showed elevated P15941 cytolytic activity following therapy , such responses did not correlate with therapeutic efficacy . Long-term survivors showed elevated levels of systemic memory ( CD45RO ) and naïve ( CD45RA ) CD3/ P01730 /CD25(+) T cells when compared to that of pre-treatment levels and similarly treated short-term survivors . Such cells co-expressed different levels of Foxp3 and P16410 that resulted in progressively lower systemic Foxp3/ P16410 memory T cell ratios that further correlated with disease-free survival . Lastly , these patients showed elevated levels of P15941 -specific T cells expressing the P51681 and P32246 chemokine receptors and the chemokine P13236 associated with Th1 cell differentiation/memory . We suggest that effective immunotherapy with autologous P15941 -stimulated P01730 (+) effector cells induces differential levels of systemic " Ag-experienced " and " Ag-inexperienced " P01730 /CD25(+) TReg cell subpopulations that influence long-term tumor immunity in ovarian cancer patients . Metabolism of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by human cytochromes P450 2D6 and 3A4 . DB00734 is a relatively new antipsychotic drug that has been reported to improve both the positive and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and produces relatively few extrapyramidal side effects at low doses . Formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone , an active metabolite , is the most important metabolic pathway of risperidone in human . In the present study , in vitro metabolism of risperidone ( 100 microM ) was investigated using the recombinant human cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes P04798 , P05177 , P10632 , P11712 -arg144 , P11712 -cys144 , P33261 , P10635 , P08684 and P20815 supplemented with an NADPH-generating system . DB01267 was determined by a new HPLC method with an Hypersil CN column and a UV detector . Of these enzymes , CYPs 2D6 , 3A4 and 3A5 were found to be the ones capable of metabolising risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone , with activities of 7.5 , 0.4 and 0.2 pmol pmol(-1) CYP min(-1) , respectively . A correlation study using a panel of human liver microsomes showed that the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone is highly correlated with P10635 and 3A activities . Thus , both P10635 and 3A4 are involved in the 9-hydroxylation of risperidone at the concentration of risperidone used in this study . This observation is confirmed by the findings that both quinidine ( inhibitor of P10635 ) and ketoconazole ( inhibitor of P08684 ) can inhibit the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone . Furthermore , inducers of CYP can significantly increase the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone in rat . The formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone is highly correlated with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activities , suggesting that inducible CYP3A contributes significantly to the metabolism of risperidone in rat . New data integrating multitargeted antifolates into treatment of first-line and relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer . Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) represents approximately 80 % of all lung cancers . With modern platinum- based combination regimens , overall median survival has reached 9-12 months . Antifolates are active against several solid tumors and hematologic malignancies . The cytotoxic action of antifolates is mainly related to their ability to inhibit several different folate-dependent enzymes involved in DNA synthesis . DB00642 is a novel multitargeted antifolate that inhibits at least 3 of the enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis : thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) . DB00642 was approved for the treatment of relapsed NSCLC as it produced equivalent response and survival rates and less toxicity compared with docetaxel . DB00642 in combination with platinum analogues or with gemcitabine showed equivalent clinical impact compared with standard combinations of platinum plus third-generation agents . We analyze the potential implications of pemetrexed 's role in first-line chemotherapy of NSCLC as well as hints of differential cytotoxic action according to histology , new schedules of vitamin supplementation , and target enzymes expression levels . Issues of pharmacogenomics are becoming relevant in defining pemetrexed efficacy . Chemosensitivity was significantly linked to low levels of TS , GARFT , and P00374 in preclinical models . Consequently , the differential expression of TS according to histology might explain the different activity of pemetrexed according to histology , as recently postulated . Development of stable cell lines expressing different subtypes of GABAA receptors . The experiments reported here were motivated by our interest to express in stably-transfected cells large amounts of recombinant rat GABAA receptors . For this , we developed an original two step selection strategy , in which the first step consisted of transfecting P29320 293 cells with rat GABAA receptor alpha and beta subunits . G 418 resistant colonies isolated at this step were screened for [ 3H ] muscimol binding to select for those that coexpressed alpha- and beta-subunits . The best alpha and beta subunit expressing colony was then supertransfected with a plasmid coding for the gamma rat GABAA receptor subunit and a mutant P00374 gene . After a second round of selection , this time in presence of methotrexate , those colonies that coexpressed ternary alpha beta gamma GABAA receptor combinations were distinguished using [ 3H ] flumazenil as a probe . This strategy was applied to the isolation of 3 GABAA receptor clones , alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s , alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2s and alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2s , that expressed relatively high levels of these proteins . These 3 cell lines exhibited pharmacological and functional properties similar to cells transiently-transfected with equivalent subunit combinations . These cell lines therefore provide attractive models with which to evaluate the intrinsic activity and potency of compounds at recombinant GABAA receptor subtypes . Recent advances in classical and non-classical antifolates as antitumor and antiopportunistic infection agents : Part II . Antifolates that inhibit the key enzymes thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) have found clinical utility as antitumor and antiopportunistic agents . DB00563 { MTX , ( 1 ) } and 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) were among the first clinically useful P00374 and TS inhibitors , respectively . The development of resistance to DB00544 , its occasional unpredictable activity and toxicity resulted in the search of novel antifolates . DB00642 ( 4 ) and raltitrexed ( 5 ) are newer antifolates that specifically inhibit TS , and are clinically useful as antitumor agents . A major mechanism of tumor resistance to clinically useful antifolates is based on their need for polyglutamylation via the enzyme folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase ( Q05932 ) . Recently , classical antifolates that do not need to be polyglutamylated have also been developed and include plevitrexed ( 6 ) and GW1843 ( 7 ) . Nolatrexed ( 8 ) , trimethoprim { P54849 , ( 11 ) } and piritrexim { PTX , ( 12 ) } are nonclassical antifolates for antitumor and parasitic chemotherapy that passively diffuse into cells and hence do not have to depend on Q05932 or the reduced folate carrier ( P41440 ) . Structural requirements for inhibition with antifolates have been studied extensively and novel agents that exploit key interactions in the active site of TS , P00374 , Q05932 , and P41440 have been proposed . This two-part review discusses the design , synthesis and structural requirements for TS and P00374 inhibition and their relevance to antitumor and parasitic chemotherapy , since 1996 . Monocyclic and 6-5 fused bicyclic antifolates were discussed in Part I . The 6-6 bicyclic and tricyclic antifolates will be discussed here in Part II . Allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 40 candidate genes for gene-environment studies on cancer : data from population-based Japanese random samples . Knowledge of genetic polymorphisms in gene-environment studies may contribute to more accurate identification of avoidable risks and to developing tailor-made preventative measures . The aim of this study was to describe the allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of select genes , which may be included in future gene-environment studies on cancer in Japan . SNP typing was performed on middle-aged Japanese men randomly selected from the general population in five areas of Japan . We genotyped and calculated allele frequencies of 153 SNPs located on 40 genes : P04798 , Q16678 , P11712 , P33261 , P05181 , P05093 , P11511 , P35869 , P03372 , Q92731 , ERRRG , P06401 , P07099 , P34913 , P37059 , P37058 , P28161 , P21266 , GSTT2 , P09211 , NAT1 , NAT2 , P21964 , P07327 , P00325 , P00326 , P05091 , P35228 , NOS3 , P01583 , P01584 , O15527 , P36639 [ P36639 ] , P14416 , P35462 , P21917 , P31645 , P04150 [ GCCR ] , P42898 , and P15559 . In the present study , the Japanese allele frequencies were verified by using nationwide population samples . DB00642 alters folate phenotype and inflammatory profile in EA.hy 926 cells grown under low-folate conditions . Elevated homocysteine is a risk marker for several major human pathologies . Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations of folate/homocysteine metabolism can directly modify production of inflammatory mediators . DB00642 acts by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase ( P04818 ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) . EA.hy 926 cells grown under low ( " Lo " ) and high ( " Hi " ) folate conditions were treated with pemetrexed . The concentrations of several intracellular folate derivatives were measured using LC-MRM/MS . Lo cells had lower total folate concentrations and a different distribution of the intracellular folate derivatives than Hi cells . Treatment with pemetrexed caused a decrease in individual folate analytes . Microarray analysis showed that several genes were significantly up or down-regulated in pemetrexed treated Lo cells . Several of the significantly up-regulated transcripts were inflammatory . Changes in transcript levels of selected targets , including P01024 , P10145 , and P00374 , were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR . P01024 and P10145 transcript levels were increased in pemetrexed-treated Lo cells relative to Lo controls ; P00374 transcript levels were decreased . In Lo cells , P10145 and P01024 protein concentrations were increased following pemetrexed treatment . DB00642 drug treatment was shown in this study to have effects that lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators in Lo cells . No such changes were observed in Hi cells , suggesting that pemetrexed could not modify the inflammatory profile in the context of cellular folate sufficiency . Effects of retroviral-mediated P08183 expression on hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in culture . Ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells would be useful for bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy applications . Toward this goal , we have investigated whether retrovirally-transduced murine stem cells could be expanded in culture with hematopoietic cytokines . Bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing either the human multidrug resistance 1 gene ( HaMDR1 ) , a variant of human dihydrofolate reductase ( HaDHFR ) , or both P08183 and P00374 in an internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) -containing bicistronic vector ( HaMID ) . Cells were then expanded for 15 days in cultures stimulated with interleukin ( IL ) -3 , P05231 , and stem cell factor . When very low marrow volumes were injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice , long-term reconstitution with 100 % donor cells was seen in all mice injected with HaMDR1- or HaMID-transduced cells . By contrast , engraftment with HaDHFR- or mock-transduced cells ranged from partial to undetectable despite injection of significantly larger marrow volumes . In addition , mice transplanted with expanded HaMDR1- or HaMID-transduced stem cells developed a myeloproliferative disorder that was characterized by an increase in abnormal peripheral blood leukocytes . These results show that P08183 -transduced stem cells can be expanded in vitro with hematopoietic cytokines , but indicate that an increased stem cell division frequency can lead to stem cell damage . Establishment of pemetrexed-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cell lines . DB00642 ( P15941 ) , a multitargeted antifolate with manageable toxicity , is active against non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ; however , most patients eventually acquire resistance to P15941 . To elucidate the resistant mechanism , we established P15941 -resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines . Two parental cell lines , PC-9 and A549 , were treated with step-wise increasing concentrations of P15941 . Growth inhibition was determined by the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thizol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay . Expression of the genes encoding thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) was analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . The four PC-9 sublines were more resistant than the PC-9 cell line to P15941 ( 2.2- , 2.9- , 8.4- , and 14.3-fold , respectively ) . The four A549 sublines also showed more resistance to P15941 ( 7.8- , 9.6- , 42.3- , and 42.4-fold , respectively ) than the parent cell line . All resistant sublines showed cross-resistance to cisplatin , but not to docetaxel , vinorelbine , 5-fluorouracil , or the active metabolite of irinotecan , SN-38 . All P15941 -resistant sublines expressed more TS than the parental cells , by polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting . P00374 was significantly increased in the four P15941 -resistant A549 sublines . GARFT did not correlate with resistance to P15941 . In summary , P15941 -resistant cells remained sensitive to docetaxel , vinorelbine , 5-fluorouracil , and irinotecan . TS expression appeared to be associated with resistance to P15941 . Expression patterns of the implantation-associated genes in the uterus during the estrous cycle in mice . The mRNA expression patterns of P01133 , HB- P01133 , P15514 , P01133 receptor , DB01277 , P09603 , P01583 , P01584 , IL-1 receptor type 1 , IL-1 receptor antagonist , P15018 , P23219 , P35354 , P15941 , calcitonin , and rat Q6X4U4 mouse homologue , all of which are involved in the process of conceptus implantation to the endometrium , were examined during the estrous cycle by means of real-time quantitative PCR . P35354 , HB- P01133 , P15018 , P15941 , P09603 , P01583 , P01584 , and IL-1 receptor antagonist were temporally regulated during the estrous cycle and highly expressed during the estrous stage . In the case of P23219 , P01133 , DB01277 , and P01133 receptor , the highest mRNA expression was during the diestrous stage . In contrast , the rat Q6X4U4 mouse homologue mRNA expression did not change during the estrous cycle . These results indicate that rat Q6X4U4 mouse homologue expression at implantation might be specifically regulated by embryonic factors rather than the maternal environment . DB00945 antagonizes the cytotoxic effect of methotrexate in lung cancer cells . DB00563 ( MTX ) has been widely used for the treatment of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . DB00945 ( ASA ) is a non-selective cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibitor that contributes to the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as RA . It has been observed that the antitumor effect of ASA can be attributed to inhibition of cell cycle progression , induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis . In the present study , we revealed that the treatment with a combination of MTX and ASA resulted in antagonism of the cytotoxic effect as demonstrated by P50991 and colony formation assays . ASA alleviated the MTX-mediated S phase accumulation and recovered the P55008 phase . MTX-mediated accumulation of the S phase marker cyclin A was also alleviated by ASA . Notably , FAS protein levels were upregulated by MTX in A549 cells . The antagonism of MTX efficacy caused by ASA was accompanied by altered expression of caspase-3 , Bcl-2 and FAS but not dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . This suggests that the alteration of caspase-3 , Bcl-2 and FAS was involved in the antagonism between ASA and MTX . Exogenously added folic acid reversed the MTX-mediated P00374 inhibition following either MTX or MTX + ASA treatments . Most importantly , we demonstrated for the first time that the commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for headache ASA and possibly other P23219 /2 inhibitors can produce a strong antagonistic effect on the growth inhibition of lung cancer cells when administered in combination with MTX . The clinical implication of our finding is obvious , i.e. , the clinical efficacy of MTX therapy can be compromised by ASA and their concomitant use should be avoided . DB00316 -inhibitable P35354 . Although paracetamol potently reduces pain and fever , its mechanism of action has so far not been satisfactorily explained . It inhibits both P23219 and P35354 weakly in vitro , but reduces prostaglandin synthesis markedly in vivo . In mouse macrophage J774.2 cells , P35354 induced for 48 hr with high concentrations of NSAIDs is more sensitive to inhibition with paracetamol than endotoxin-induced P35354 . In the rat pleurisy model of inflammation , a second peak of P35354 protein appears 48 hr after administration of the inflammatory stimulus , during the resolution phase of the inflammatory process . Inhibition of the activity of this late-appearing P35354 with indomethacin or a selective P35354 inhibitor , delays resolution and the inflammation is prolonged . Cultured lung fibroblasts also express P35354 activity after stimulation with IL-1beta which is highly sensitive to inhibition with paracetamol . Thus , evidence is accumulating for the existence of a P35354 variant or a new P36551 enzyme which can be inhibited with paracetamol . DB00067 triggers senescence in K-ras transformed cells via RhoA-dependent downregulation of cyclin D1 . DB00067 ( AVP ) , a vasoactive peptide hormone that binds to three G-protein coupled receptors ( V1R , P30518 , and V3R ) , has long been known to activate V1R and elicit mitogenesis in several cell types , including adrenal glomerulosa cells . However , in the mouse Q03519 adrenocortical malignant cell line , AVP triggers not only a canonical mitogenic response but also novel RhoA-GTP-dependent mechanisms which downregulate cyclin D1 , irreversibly inhibiting K-ras oncogene-driven proliferation . In Q03519 cells , AVP blocks cyclin D1 expression , induces senescence-associated beta-galactosidase ( SAbeta-Gal ) and inhibits proliferation . However , ectopic expression of cyclin D1 renders Q03519 cells resistant to both SAbeta-Gal induction and proliferation inhibition by AVP . In addition , ectopic expression of the dominant negative RhoAN19 mutant blocks RhoA activation , yielding Q03519 cell sub-lines which are no longer susceptible to cyclin D1 downregulation , SAbeta-Gal induction , or proliferation inhibition by AVP . Furthermore , inhibiting RhoA with P01024 exoenzyme protects Q03519 cells from AVP proliferation inhibition and SAbeta-Gal induction . On the other hand , AVP treatment does not activate caspases 3 and 7 , and the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CMK does not protect Q03519 cells from proliferation inhibition by AVP , implying that AVP does not trigger apoptosis . These results underline a pivotal survival activity of cyclin D1 that protects K-ras oncogene-dependent malignant cells from senescence . Activation of the MyD88 signaling pathway inhibits ischemia-reperfusion injury in the small intestine . Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) recognize microbial components and trigger the signaling cascade that activates innate and adaptive immunity . Recent studies have shown that the activation of TLR-dependent signaling pathways plays important roles in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injuries in many organs . All TLRs , except O15455 , use a common adaptor protein , MyD88 , to transduce activation signals . We investigated the role of MyD88 in I/R injury of the small intestine . MyD88 and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) knockout and wild-type mice were subjected to intestinal I/R injury . I/R-induced small intestinal injury was characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells , disruption of the mucosal epithelium , destruction of villi , and increases in myeloperoxidase activity and mRNA levels of P01375 -α and the P10145 homolog KC . MyD88 deficiency worsened the severity of I/R injury , as assessed using the histological grading system , measuring luminal contents of hemoglobin ( a marker of intestinal bleeding ) , and counting apoptotic epithelial cells , while it inhibited the increase in mRNA expression of P01375 -α and KC . I/R significantly enhanced P35354 expression and increased PGE(2) concentration in the small intestine of wild-type mice , which were markedly inhibited by MyD88 deficiency . P35354 knockout mice were also highly susceptible to intestinal I/R injury . Exogenous PGE(2) reduced the severity of injury in both MyD88 and P35354 knockout mice to the level of wild-type mice . These findings suggest that the MyD88 signaling pathway may inhibit I/R injury in the small intestine by inducing P35354 expression . Association of P35462 and Q13224 with impulse control and related behaviors in Parkinson 's disease . We aimed to assess whether allelic variants of dopamine receptor , glutamate receptor , and serotonin transporter genes are associated with the appearance of impulse control and related behaviors ( ICRB ) in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) with dopamine replacement therapy ( P29323 ) . We surveyed ICRB in consecutive Korean patients with PD who were treated with stable P29323 using modified Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview over a period of 4 months . In the 404 patients who completed the interview and the 559 Korean healthy normal controls , genotyping was performed for variants of the P35462 p.S9G , P14416 Taq1A , Q13224 c.366C > G , c.2664C > T and c.-200T > G , and the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene ( 5-HTTLPR ) . Behavioral abnormalities suggestive of ICRB including compulsive buying , gambling , sexual behavior and eating , and punding , were present in 14.4 % of the patients . Variants of P14416 and 5-HTTLPR were not associated with the risk of developing ICRB . However , the AA genotype of P35462 p.S9G and the CC genotype of Q13224 c.366C > G were more frequent in patients with ICRB than in nonaffected patients ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.21 , P = 0.0094 ; and 2.14 , P = 0.0087 , after adjusting for age and sex ) . After controlling for clinical variables in the multivariate analysis , carriage of either AA genotype of P35462 or CC genotype of Q13224 was identified as an independent risk factor for ICRB ( adjusted OR : 2.57 , P = 0.0087 ) . Variants of P35462 p.S9G and Q13224 c.366C > G may be associated with the appearance of ICRB in PD . Cbl-b is a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokines produced by IgE-activated mast cells . c-Cbl and Cbl-b E3 ubiquitin ligases are abundantly expressed in hemopoietic cells where they negatively regulate the activity and levels of many cell surface receptors and associated signaling molecules . By comparing bone marrow-derived mast cells from c-Cbl and Cbl-b-deficient mice it has recently been shown that Cbl-b is the dominant family member for negatively regulating signaling responses from high-affinity IgE receptors . In this study , we suggest that a possible reason for the greater enhancement of IgE receptor signaling in Cbl-b-deficient mice is the relatively higher levels of Cbl-b protein over c-Cbl in mast cells compared with other hemopoietic cells . We also directly compare mast cells from c-Cbl and Cbl-b-deficient mice and find that loss of Cbl-b , but not c-Cbl , increases cell growth , retards receptor internalization , and causes the sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and its substrates . However , loss of Cbl-b does not enhance the activation of P29323 or Akt , nor does it promote a greater calcium response . Furthermore , loss of Cbl-b or c-Cbl does not increase levels of the Syk or Lyn protein tyrosine kinases . Most notable , however , is the extremely large increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines P01375 , P05231 , and P13500 by Cbl-b(-/-) mast cells compared with levels produced by c-Cbl(-/-) or wild-type cells . This marked induction , which appears to be restricted to these three cytokines , is dependent on IgE receptor activation and correlates with enhanced O15111 phosphorylation . Thus , Cbl-b functions as a potent negative regulator of cytokines that promote allergic and inflammatory reactions . Celecoxib with chemotherapy in colorectal cancer . P35354 ( P35354 ) is the enzyme that normally synthesizes prostaglandins during an inflammatory response . Many primary and metastatic cancers express P35354 , and its presence is correlated with tumor angiogenesis , more invasive tumor phenotype , resistance to apoptosis , and systemic immunosuppression . The expression of P35354 is associated with a worse prognosis . Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may be beneficial in human malignancy . Regular consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) decreases the incidence of , and mortality rate resulting from , a number of types of gastrointestinal cancers . Premalignant colonic lesions regress following the administration of nonspecific P36551 inhibitors , such as sulindac ( DB00605 ) . Advanced solid tumor patients treated with indomethacin ( DB00328 ) survive twice as long as do such patients who receive supportive care alone . The U.S . Food and Drug Administration has approved specific P35354 inhibitors for the treatment of arthritis , pain , and familial adenomatous polyposis . Preclinical studies show that these drugs block angiogenesis , suppress solid tumor metastases , and slow the growth of implanted gastrointestinal cancer cell lines . The P35354 inhibitors have safely and effectively been combined with chemotherapeutic agents in experimental studies . Ongoing clinical trials are currently assessing the potential therapeutic role of P35354 inhibitors in both prevention and treatment of a diverse range of human cancers . In vivo protection of activated Tyr22-dihydrofolate reductase gene-modified canine T lymphocytes from methotrexate . BACKGROUND : Nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell ( P19526 ) transplantation can cure malignant and nonmalignant diseases affecting the hematopoietic system , such as severe combined immunodeficiencies , aplastic anemia and hemoglobinopathies . Although nonmyeloablative is favored over myeloablative transplantation for many patients , graft rejection remains problematic . One strategy for decreasing rejection is to protect donor activated T cells in the graft from methotrexate ( MTX ) by genetically modifying the cells to express MTX-resistant dihydrofolate reductase ( Tyr22- P00374 ) , leaving the immunosuppressive effects of MTX to act solely on activated host T lymphocytes , shifting the balance to favor allogeneic engraftment . METHODS : To evaluate MTX resistance of Tyr22- P00374 (+) T lymphocytes in vivo , we transplanted dogs with autologous P28906 (+) cells modified with yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) and P00374 -green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) lentivirus vectors . Dogs were then treated with a standard MTX regimen days 1 , 3 , 6 and 11 ) following immune activation with a foreign antigen as a surrogate assay to mimic early transplantation . RESULTS : P00374 -GFP(+) gene marking was maintained in CD3(+) CD25(+) and P01730 (+) T lymphocytes after MTX treatment , whereas the level of T lymphocytes that expressed only a fluorescent reporter ( YFP(+) ) decreased . These data show that Tyr22- P00374 expression protects T lymphocytes from MTX toxicity in dogs , highlighting a clinically relevant application for preserving donor T lymphocytes during post-transplantation immunosuppression . CONCLUSIONS : The findings of the present study have implications for the clinical translation of MTX-resistant T cells to facilitate engraftment of allogeneic cells following nonmyeloablative conditioning and to minimize the risk of rejection . In summary , Tyr22- P00374 expression in T lymphocytes provides chemoprotection from MTX-mediated elimination in the context of immune activation in vivo . Cellular mechanisms of the hemostatic effects of desmopressin ( DB00035 ) . The synthetic analog of vasopressin desmopressin ( DB00035 ) is widely used for the treatment of patients with von Willebrand disease ( VWD ) , hemophilia A , several platelet disorders , and uremic bleeding . DB00035 induces an increase in plasma levels of P04275 ( P04275 ) , coagulation factor VIII ( FVIII ) , and tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) . It also has a vasodilatory action . In spite of its extensive clinical use , its cellular mechanism of action remains incompletely understood . Its effect on P04275 and t-PA as well as its vasodilatory effect are likely explained by a direct action on the endothelium , via activation of endothelial vasopressin P30518 receptor and DB02527 -mediated signaling . This leads to exocytosis from Weibel Palade bodies where both P04275 and t-PA are stored , as well as to nitric oxide ( NO ) production via activation of endothelial NO synthase . The mechanism of action of DB00035 on FVIII plasma levels remains to be elucidated . The hemostatic effect of DB00035 likely involves additional cellular effects that remain to be discovered . Design , synthesis , and X-ray crystal structures of 2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidines as multireceptor tyrosine kinase and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors . To optimize dual receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibition , the E- and Z-isomers of 5-[2-(2-methoxyphenyl)prop-1-en-1-yl]furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamines ( 1a and 1b ) were separated by HPLC and the X-ray crystal structures ( 2.0 and 1.4A , respectively ) with mouse P00374 and NADPH as well as 1b with human P00374 ( 1.5A ) were determined . The E- and Z-isomers adopt different binding modes when bound to mouse P00374 . A series of 2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidines 2-13 were designed and synthesized using the X-ray crystal structures of 1a and 1b with P00374 to increase their P00374 inhibitory activity . Wittig reactions of appropriate 2-methoxyphenyl ketones with 2,4-diamino-6-chloromethyl furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine afforded the Q99618 - P02748 unsaturated compounds 2-7 and catalytic reduction gave the saturated 8-13 . Homologation of the P02748 -methyl analog maintains P00374 inhibitory activity . In addition , inhibition of P00533 and P09619 were discovered for saturated P02748 -homologated analogs 9 and 10 that were absent in the saturated P02748 -methyl analogs . Oral keratinocytes support non-replicative infection and transfer of harbored HIV-1 to permissive cells . BACKGROUND : Oral keratinocytes on the mucosal surface are frequently exposed to HIV-1 through contact with infected sexual partners or nursing mothers . To determine the plausibility that oral keratinocytes are primary targets of HIV-1 , we tested the hypothesis that HIV-1 infects oral keratinocytes in a restricted manner . RESULTS : To study the fate of HIV-1 , immortalized oral keratinocytes ( OKF6/ O14746 -2 ; O14746 -2 cells ) were characterized for the fate of HIV-specific RNA and DNA . At 6 h post inoculation with X4 or R5-tropic HIV-1 , HIV-1gag RNA was detected maximally within O14746 -2 cells . Reverse transcriptase activity in O14746 -2 cells was confirmed by VSV-G-mediated infection with HIV-NL4-3Deltaenv-EGFP . DB00495 inhibited EGFP expression in a dose-dependent manner , suggesting that viral replication can be supported if receptors are bypassed . Within 3 h post inoculation , integrated HIV-1 DNA was detected in O14746 -2 cell nuclei and persisted after subculture . Multiply spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs were not detectable up to 72 h post inoculation , suggesting that HIV replication may abort and that infection is non-productive . Within 48 h post inoculation , however , virus harbored by P01730 negative O14746 -2 cells trans infected co-cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) or MOLT4 cells ( P01730 + P51681 + ) by direct cell-to-cell transfer or by releasing low levels of infectious virions . Primary tonsil epithelial cells also trans infected HIV-1 to permissive cells in a donor-specific manner . CONCLUSION : Oral keratinocytes appear , therefore , to support stable non-replicative integration , while harboring and transmitting infectious X4- or R5-tropic HIV-1 to permissive cells for up to 48 h . Effect of dietary NaCl on tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglia of Dahl rats . To investigate the involvement of peripheral catecholamines in the development of Dahl-Iwai salt-sensitive ( Q8IX12 /Eis ) hypertension , we performed immunohistochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) in the superior cervical ganglia ( SCG ) of Q8IX12 /Eis rats and Dahl-Iwai salt-resistant ( P30518 /Eis ) rats , and in situ hybridization histochemistry for demonstration of TH mRNA localization in the SCG of these rats . Q8IX12 /Eis and P30518 /Eis rats were fed on a high ( 8 % ) salt diet or on a low ( 0.3 % ) salt diet for 4 weeks . Nerve cells in the SCG of Q8IX12 /Eis high salt rats exhibited more intense TH-immunoreactivity ( P < 0.01 ) and hybridization signals ( P < 0.01 ) than those of the other experimental groups . These findings suggest that activation of peripheral sympathetic nerves may account for hypertension in Q8IX12 /Eis rats on a high salt diet . Production of recombinant proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the subtilisin-like proprotein converting enzyme furin . The proprotein processing enzyme furin is the mammalian prototype of a novel family of subtilisin-like serine endoproteases which possess cleavage specificity for sites involving multiple basic amino acid residues and are involved in the processing of precursor proteins of a variety of regulatory peptides and proteins . One of the limiting steps in the engineering of mammalian cells designed for the overproduction of secreted proteins is the endoproteolytic cleavage of the precursor molecule to its mature biologically active form . The extremely low level of endogenous furin is likely the reason why cells are not able to fully mature overexpressed precursor proteins to their mature form . Here , we report a CHO-derived cell line genetically engineered for the production of high levels of recombinant proteins that need such endoproteolytic maturation . First , the human furin cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus early promoter and enhancer was introduced and overexpressed in a P00374 -deficient CHO cell line . A permanent cell line CHO-D3- P09958 was established that expressed biologically active furin . Subsequently , to demonstrate the capacity of CHO-D3- P09958 cells to produce recombinant proteins in a fully matured form , two derivative cell lines were established that overexpressed the P04275 ( P04275 ) and transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGF beta 1 ) ; CHO-D3- P04275 and CHO-D3-TGF beta 1 , respectively . Both derivative cell lines were able to produce relatively high levels of recombinant protein in a fully matured and biologically active form . Our results illustrate the potential of the CHO-D3- P09958 cell line in the production of recombinant secretory proteins that need endoproteolytic activation at the consensus furin cleavage sequence DB00125 -X-Lys/ DB00125 - DB00125 . Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas usually retained Q13485 and p53 protein status as well as expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers and cell cycle regulators at the stage of liver metastasis . There are limited data on the biology of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) . The aim of the present study was to compare the expression of immunohistochemical markers that may be involved in the development of metastatic disease in primary PDAC and in synchronous liver metastatic tissues . Thirty-two stains ( corresponding to proteins encoded by 31 genes : Q13485 , P04637 , P62736 , CDH1 , P38936 , O95832 , O14493 , O95471 , P35222 , P00533 , P04626 , P02751 , P08727 , P28482 / P27361 , Q16539 , P46013 , P08253 , P14780 , P15941 ( 3 antibodies ) , P98088 , Q6W4X9 , P42345 , MYC , P48681 , P35354 , P62753 , P23443 , P01137 , P36897 , P08670 ) were evaluated using tissue microarray of 26 pairs of primary PDACs and their liver metastases . There were no significant differences in expression levels of examined proteins between primary and secondary lesions . In particular , metastatic PDAC retained the primary tumour 's Q13485 protein status in all and p53 protein status in all but one case . This surprising homogeneity also involved expression levels of markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as well as cell cycle regulators studied . In conclusion , the biological profiles of primary PDACs and their liver metastases seemed to be similar . Molecular alterations of PDAC related to a set of immunohistochemical markers examined in the present study were already present at the stage of localized disease . DB00909 block of cloned human T-type voltage-gated calcium channels . DB00909 ( ZNS ) is a multi-target antiepileptic drug reported to be efficient in the treatment of both partial and generalized seizures , with T-type Ca(2+) channel blockade being one of its proposed mechanisms of action . In this study , we systematically investigated electrophysiological effects of ZNS on cloned human Ca(v)3.1-3.3 Ca(2+) channels in a heterologous P29320 -293 expression system using whole cell patch-clamp technique . Concentration-response studies were performed in the range from 5 microM to 2mM for Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) channels exhibiting a 15.4-30.8 % reduction of Ca(2+) influx within the maximum therapeutic plasma range ( 50-200 microM ZNS ) . The other T-type Ca(2+) channel entities , Ca(v)3.1 and Q9P0X4 , were even less sensitive to ZNS . Both voltage- and concentration-dependence of inactivation kinetics remained unchanged for Ca(v)3.2 VGCC , whereas Ca(v)3.1 and Q9P0X4 exhibited minor , though significant reduction of inactivation-tau . Interestingly , ZNS block of Ca(v)3.2 VGCCs was not use-dependent and remained unaffected by changes in the holding potential . Steady-state inactivation studies did not display a significant shift in steady-state availability of Ca(v)3.2 channels at 100 microM ZNS ( DeltaV(1/2)=3.1mV , p=0.071 ) . Our studies indicate that ZNS is a moderate blocker of human Ca(v)3 T-type Ca(2+) channels with little or no effect on Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) channel inactivation kinetics , use- and state-dependence of blockade . These results suggest that T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibition only partially contributes to the anti-absence activity of ZNS antiepileptic drug . Differential role for phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate-stimulated MAPK activation , Cox-2 and P10145 expression . Phospholipase D ( PLD ) is expressed in many tissues and stimulated by growth factors and cytokines . However , the role of PLD in signal transduction is still not well-understood . Human embryonic kidney ( P29320 -293 ) cells exhibit low levels of both Q13393 and O14939 mRNA , however , only Q13393 protein was detected by Western blot . When either isoform of PLD was stably expressed in P29320 -293 cells , we observed an increased PLD activity in a cell-free system and a 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate ( TPA ) -stimulated increase in PLD activity in intact cells . This system was then used to elucidate the effects of PLD activity on TPA-stimulated signaling pathways . Two such pathways , the mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) , extracellular regulated protein kinase ( P29323 ) and p38 are activated by growth factors and cellular stress , respectively . We found that TPA stimulated P29323 phosphorylation regardless of the expression status of PLD . In contrast to P29323 kinase , P29320 -293 cells were unable to induce p38 phosphorylation by TPA stimulation . When P29320 -293 cells expressed either Q13393 or O14939 , we observed elevated p38 phosphorylation in response to TPA stimulation . The P29323 and p38 MAPKs can also stimulate the expression of both cyclooxygenase-2 ( Cox-2 ) and interleukin-8 ( P10145 ) . We used this system to differentiate the effect of Q13393 or O14939 activity on the expression of Cox-2 and P10145 . Increased Cox-2 and P10145 expression was found only in P29320 -293 cells expressing Q13393 . These data identify a novel role for the Q13393 isoform in the induction of gene expression and provide new insight into the differential role of Q13393 and O14939 in cells . Functional polymorphisms of folate-metabolizing enzymes in relation to homocysteine concentrations in systemic lupus erythematosus . OBJECTIVE : To determine if functional polymorphisms of folate/homocysteine pathway enzymes are associated with homocysteine concentrations and/or coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) scores in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and controls . METHODS : We investigated 163 SLE patients and 160 controls . Functional polymorphisms in 6 genes in the folate/homocysteine pathway were genotyped : 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( P42898 ) 677C > T , P42898 1298A > C , cystathionine ss-synthase ( P35520 ) 844ins68 , methionine synthase ( Q99707 ) 2756A > G , methionine synthase reductase ( Q9UBK8 ) 66A > G , thymidylate synthase ( P04818 ) 1494del6 , and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) c.86+60_78 . RESULTS : Homocysteine levels were higher in African American SLE patients than Caucasian patients and African American controls . Genotype distributions were significantly different in African American and Caucasian controls for 6 of the 7 polymorphisms . Genotype distributions for each polymorphism did not differ significantly between SLE patients and controls even after stratification by race . Glomerular filtration rate was strongly negatively correlated to homocysteine levels , and was therefore adjusted for as a covariate in the models of the effects of the polymorphisms on homocysteine levels . In SLE patients none of the 7 polymorphisms was associated with homocysteine concentrations . In Caucasian controls only P42898 677C > T and 1298A > C showed effects on homocysteine similar to what would be expected from the literature . There were no genotypic associations with median CAC scores in SLE patients or controls with and without stratification by race . CONCLUSION : Polymorphisms in folate/homocysteine metabolizing enzymes do not predict higher homocysteine levels or CAC scores in patients with SLE . P15941 expression is repressed by protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription-y . Mucin 1 ( P15941 ) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that modulates the interaction between the embryo and the uterine epithelial cell surface . P15941 also is a tumor marker and has been implicated in the protection of cancer cells from immune cell attack as well as in cell signaling in some tumors . We and others have shown that P15941 expression is activated by progesterone ( P ) , P01375 , and interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) . Here we demonstrate that P15941 expression is down-regulated by overexpression of members of the protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription ( PIAS ) family , O75925 , Q9Y6X2 , PIASxalpha , PIASxbeta , and Q8N2W9 , in human uterine epithelial cell lines DB09106 and O14777 -1A and in a breast cancer cell line , T47D . Treatments with P , P01375 , and P01579 were unable to overcome the repression by Q8N2W9 . Q8N2W9 repression of basal , P- , and P01375 -stimulated P15941 promoter activity was not dependent on the Q8N2W9 sumoylation domain . In contrast , Q8N2W9 suppression of P01579 -activated P15941 promoter activity was dependent on the Q8N2W9 sumoylation domain . Q8N2W9 and P receptor B were localized to the nucleus upon P treatment , and small interfering RNA knockdown of Q8N2W9 resulted in an increase in P-mediated stimulation of P15941 protein expression . Overexpression of Q8N2W9 did not affect P receptor B binding to the P15941 promoter but surprisingly led to a loss of nuclear receptor corepressor ( NCoR ) , which was recruited to the promoter in response to P. Collectively , these data indicate that Q8N2W9 may be a useful target for down-regulation of P15941 expression in various contexts . The role of pemetrexed in advanced non small-cell lung cancer : special focus on pharmacology and mechanism of action . DB00642 is a newer antifolate drug that has been approved as first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-squamous , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in combination with cisplatin , and as single agent for relapsed or chemotherapy refractory NSCLC after platinum-containing chemotherapy , at a dose of 500 mg/m(2) . DB00642 undergoes intracellular activation by poly-gamma-glutamylation , that is essential for its antiproliferative activity . Polyglutamate derivatives mainly inhibit three key enzymes of intracellular folate metabolism , i.e. thymidylates synthase ( P04818 ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , with P04818 being the most relevant target . DB00642 undergoes rapid renal elimination as unchanged parent compound , with a terminal half-life of between two to five hours . In later clinical development , the usefulness of supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B(12) became evident , to control pemetrexed-related toxicity . The results from the phase III upfront registration study , a retrospective observational data , and a recent maintenance study of pemetrexed in NSCLC suggest histological subtype to be the most important predictive marker for clinical outcome in patients receiving pemetrexed , DB00642 is active in patients with non-squamous cell NSCLC while no benefit is seen in patients with squamous-cell histology , possibly as a result of different expression of intratumoral P04818 . These are important steps towards individualisation of anticancer treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC . DB06212 , a selective oral vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist , ameliorates podocyte injury in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrotic rats . BACKGROUND : Proteinuria caused by glomerular disease is characterized by podocyte injury . P30518 antagonists are effective in reducing albuminuria , although their actions on glomerular podocytes have not been explored . The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of tolvaptan , a selective oral V2 receptor antagonist , on podocytes in a puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) -induced nephrosis rat model . METHODS : Rats were allocated to a control , PAN nephrosis , or tolvaptan-treated PAN nephrosis group ( n = 9 per group ) . Urinary protein excretion and serum levels of total protein , albumin , creatinine , and total cholesterol were measured on day 10 . The influence of tolvaptan on podocytes was examined in renal tissues by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy . RESULTS : PAN induced massive proteinuria and serum creatinine elevation on day 10 , both of which were significantly ameliorated by tolvaptan . Immunofluorescence studies of the podocyte-associated proteins nephrin and podocin revealed granular staining patterns in PAN nephrosis rats . In tolvaptan-treated rats , nephrin and podocin expressions retained their normal linear pattern . Electron microscopy showed foot process effacement was ameliorated in tolvaptan-treated rats . CONCLUSIONS : DB06212 is protective against podocyte damage and proteinuria in PAN nephrosis . This study indicates that tolvaptan exerts a renoprotective effect by affecting podocyte morphology and probably function in PAN nephrosis . DB06212 is a promising pharmacological tool in the treatment of renal edema . Correlation between tumor volume response to radiotherapy and expression of biological markers in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma . OBJECTIVE : To determine the factors associated with tumor volume response to radiotherapy ( RT ) in cervical cancer patients , and the relationship between the tumor volume response and alteration of the expression of biological markers during RT . METHODS : Twenty consecutive patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma who received definitive RT were enrolled . Tumor volumes were calculated by Q9BWK5 examinations performed at the start of RT ( pre-RT ) , at the fourth week of RT ( mid-RT ) , and 1 month after RT completion ( post-RT ) . Two serial punch biopsies were performed at pre- and mid-RT , and immunohistochemical staining was performed for cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 and epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) . RESULTS : For the pre-RT evaluation , fourteen ( 70 % ) and eleven ( 55 % ) patients showed positive immunoreactivity for P35354 and P00533 , respectively . Among the seven patients whose median percentage residual tumor at mid-RT ( P30518 ) was greater than 0.5 , seven ( 100 % , p=0.0515 ) and five ( 71.4 % , p=0.3742 ) patients showed positive immunoreactivity for P35354 and P00533 , respectively . The logistic regression analysis showed that positive immunoreactivity for both P35354 and P00533 at pre-RT were associated with P30518 ( p=0.0782 ) . For the mid-RT evaluation , eight cases showed an interval increase in the distribution of immunoreactivity for P35354 , and six out of the eight patients had a P30518 greater than 0.5 ( p=0.2222 ) . CONCLUSION : The poor mid-RT tumor response was associated with the coexpression of P35354 and P00533 . The impact of biological agents interfering with receptor/ligand binding in the immune system . We herein discuss the impact of biological agents based on the ability of monoclonal antibodies to target specific molecules . This approach has given to clinical immunologists a spectrum of drugs able to manipulate the immune system . In the first session , we discuss drugs targeting T-cell function by : ( 1 ) targeting P10747 mediated costimulation ( DB01281 and DB06681 ) ; ( 2 ) interfering with interleukin-2 receptor ( DB00074 and DB00111 ) ; ( 3 ) blocking cell adhesion and homing ( DB00092 , DB00095 , DB00108 ) . The second session is dedicated to drugs targeting cytokines or their receptors . The best known and largely experimented case is represented by drugs targeting tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) ( DB00065 , Adalilumab , Certolizumab ) or its p75 receptor ( DB00005 ) . However , newer products are now available to target other inflammatory cytokines including P05231 , P10145 , IL-12 , P40933 , Q14116 , IL-23 . These agents have the potential to become powerful tools in the control of several immune-mediated diseases , especially auto-immune and inflammatory ones . They traslate into reality the prediction that antibodies will eventually become " magic bullets which seek their own target " ( P. Ehrich , 1906 ) . Tetrandrine inhibits proinflammatory cytokines , P35228 and P35354 expression in human monocytic cells . Tetrandrine ( TET ) , a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the dried root of hang-fang-chi ( Stephania tetrandra S. Moore ) , is traditionally used in China for treating inflammation , hypertension and silicosis . In this study , our aim was to examine the anti-inflammatory mechanism of TET through measuring the inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , cyclooxygenase-1 , and -2 ( P23219 and P35354 ) expression , cytokines ( P01375 , P05112 and P10145 ) formation , nitric oxide ( NO ) release and prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) generation in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced human monocytic ( THP-1 ) cells . Results showed that TET remarkably suppressed the LPS ( 1 microg/ml ) induction of NO release and DB00917 generation . It also significantly attenuated the LPS-induced transcription of proinflammatory cytokines ( P01375 , P05112 and P10145 ) in a dose-dependent manner . Furthermore , TET at 100 microM significantly blocked the LPS induction of P35228 and P35354 expression , but not the P23219 . Taken together , these results suggest that TET exerts anti-inflammatory effects probably through the suppression of P35354 and P35228 expression . [ Cell cycle analysis of endometrial cancer cells in vitro treated with growth factor and steroid hormone ] . The aim of this study was to overtake the mechanism of the control system in endometrial cancer cell line in vitro . Ishikawa cell ( IK cell ) and O14777 -1 cell ( O14777 cell ) derived from endometrial cancers were cultured with serum free medium ( SFM-101 ) . IK cell possessed P03372 ( ER ) , P06401 ( PR ) , Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) . O14777 cell had PR , P01133 , and P00533 , however O14777 cell did not keep ER . P01133 stimulated the growth of IK cell , but the growth of O14777 cell was not stimulated by P01133 . S phase cells were increased by P01133 in IK cell , but were not increased by P01133 in O14777 cell . The growth of IK cell was stimulated significantly by P01133 and Estradiol-17 beta ( E2 ) + P01133 than control . However , E2+ P01133 did not stimulate the growth of IK cell than P01133 significantly . DB01406 ( D ) and D+ P01133 inhibited the growth of IK cell significantly than control . S phase cells were decreased by the treatment of D and D+ P01133 . From our results , P01133 stimulated the growth of ER positive endometrial cancer cell , but P01133 did not stimulate ER negative endometrial cancer cell . E2+ P01133 and P01133 stimulated the growth of IK cell as a same . However , D inhibited the growth of IK cell that was stimulated by P01133 . Effects of pemetrexed , gefitinib , and their combination on human colorectal cancer cells . PURPOSE : The study investigated the effects of pemetrexed , gefitinib , and their combination on human colorectal cancer cells . METHODS : Six human colorectal cancer cells were exposed to pemetrexed , gefitinib , and their combination . Antitumor effects were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay . P04818 ( TS ) mRNA expression and P00533 mutation were studied by real-time RT-PCR and DNA sequence determination . Pharmacological interaction was studied using the combination index method . Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry . Activity assay was performed to assess the effects of drugs on TS activity , and Western blot was performed to assess the protein expression of pEGFR , pAKT , and pERK 1/2 . RESULTS : Six colorectal cancer cells are all sensitive to pemetrexed , and TS gene expression of cells was negatively related to pemetrexed sensitivity . The cytotoxic synergism was observed in concurrent pemetrexed combined with gefitinib and sequential pemetrexed followed by gefitinib . The combination of pemetrexed and gefitinib modulated cell cycle and induced apoptosis . DB00642 combined with gefitinib decreased TS mRNA expression and in situ activity . DB00642 induced an P00533 -mediated activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and P29323 pathway , which was inhibited by gefitinib . CONCLUSIONS : DB00642 is a promising agent , and pemetrexed combined with gefitinib has a significantly synergistic effect on colorectal cancer cells , which seems to present a strategy of pemetrexed combined with P00533 -TKIs in colorectal cancer treatment . Rosiglitazone regulates P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in porcine adipocytes . Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , a proinflammatory cytokine , stimulates adipocyte lipolysis and induces insulin resistance in obese and diabetic subjects . However , the effects of the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone on P05231 -stimulated lipolysis and the underlying molecular mechanism are largely unknown . In this study , we demonstrated that rosiglitazone suppressed P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in differentiated porcine adipocytes by inactivation of extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) . Meanwhile , rosiglitazone enhanced the lipolysis response of adipocytes to isoprenaline . In addition , rosiglitazone significantly reversed P05231 -induced down-regulation of several genes such as perilipin A , peroxisome proliferators activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 & gamma ; ) , and fatty acid synthetase , as well as the up-regulation of P05231 mRNA . However , mRNA expression of Q07869 & gamma ; coactivator-1 alpha ( DB01053 -1 & alpha ; ) was enhanced by rosiglitazone in P05231 -stimulated adipocytes . These results indicate that rosiglitazone suppresses P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in porcine adipocytes through multiple molecular mechanisms . Toward a chronoimmunomodulation by cefodizime in multiple myeloma and chronic uremia . Nine healthy subjects , 19 patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) and 21 patients with chronic uremia were given cefodizime ( 2 g i.v. ) at 2 different timepoints either in the morning or in the evening for 5 to 7 consecutive days . The following immunological parameters were comparatively evaluated before and after cefodizime administration : rosette-forming cells ( P41440 % ) , T lymphocyte subpopulations , monocyte chemotaxis index ( D6RGH6 ) and granulocyte chemotaxis index ( GCI ) . Independently of the time of drug administration , a circadian rhythm was clearly detected ( 90 % CI ) as regards P41440 % , CD3 , P01730 , CD8 , P01730 /CD8 before and P41440 % , CD3 , P01730 , CD8 , GCI after therapy . In addition , in patients treated at 0800 cefodizime increased the MESOR of the D6RGH6 and , to a lesser extent , of the GCI . The chronoimmunomodulatory effects of cefodizime in patients with MM and chronic uremia are discussed . Prevalence of insomnia and associated factors in South Korea . INTRODUCTION : In Western countries , insomnia is associated with daytime impaired functioning , as well as physical and psychiatric illnesses . However , little information exists on insomnia in Asian countries . This study investigates the prevalence and correlates of insomnia in the general population of South Korea . METHODS : A representative sample of the South Korean general population composed of 3719 noninstitutionalized individuals aged 15 years or older were interviewed by telephone using the Sleep-EVAL system . The participation rate was 91.4 % . The interviews covered sleep habits , sleep symptomatology , physical and psychiatric illnesses . DSM-IV sleep and psychiatric disorder diagnoses were also assessed . RESULTS : Insomnia symptoms occurring at least three nights per week were reported by 17.0 % of the sample ; difficulty initiating sleep ( Q8IX12 ) was mentioned by 4.0 % of the sample , difficulty maintaining sleep ( DMS ) by 11.5 % , early morning awakenings ( P15941 ) by 1.8 % , and nonrestorative sleep ( NRS ) by 4.7 % of the sample . DSM-IV insomnia disorder diagnoses were found in 5 % of the sample . Over 50 % of subjects with insomnia symptoms reported important daytime consequences and another 20 % reported mild or moderate consequences . However , the proportion of insomnia subjects seeking medical help for their sleep problems was very low ( 6.8 % ) . CONCLUSIONS : As in Western countries , insomnia is widespread in South Korea , affecting nearly one in five individuals . Many of them would benefit from medical help ; however , few insomnia subjects are consulting for this problem . An educational effort is needed for both the general population and the physicians . Effects of the total saponins from Rosa laevigata Michx fruit against acetaminophen-induced liver damage in mice via induction of autophagy and suppression of inflammation and apoptosis . The effect of the total saponins from Rosa laevigata Michx fruit ( RLTS ) against acetaminophen ( DB00316 ) -induced liver damage in mice was evaluated in the present paper . The results showed that RLTS markedly improved the levels of liver SOD , CAT , DB00143 , DB00143 -Px , MDA , NO and P35228 , and the activities of serum ALT and Q9NRA2 caused by DB00316 . Further research confirmed that RLTS prevented fragmentation of DNA and mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations based on TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) assays . In addition , RLTS decreased the gene or protein expressions of cytochrome P450 ( P05181 ) , pro-inflammatory mediators ( IL-1β , P05112 , P05231 , P01375 -α , P35228 , Bax , HMGB-1 and P35354 ) , pro-inflammatory transcription factors ( NF-κB and AP-1 ) , pro-apoptotic proteins ( cytochrome C , p53 , caspase-3 , caspase-9 , p-JNK , p-p38 and p- P29323 ) , and increased the protein expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL . Moreover , the gene expression of P22301 , and the proteins including LC3 , Q14457 and Atg5 induced by DB00316 were even more augmented by the extract . These results demonstrate that RLTS has hepatoprotective effects through antioxidative action , induction of autophagy , and suppression of inflammation and apoptosis , and could be developed as a potential candidate to treat DB00316 -induced liver damage in the future . Characterization of the pattern of the nongenomic signaling pathway through which TCDD-induces early inflammatory responses in U937 human macrophages . 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo(p)dioxin ( TCDD ) has been known to induce inflammatory signaling in a number of cell types and tissues . We found that in U937 macrophages TCDD causes rapid activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( P47712 ) within 30min as judged by the increase in the serine 505 phosphorylated form of P47712 protein and the increased cellular release of free arachidonic acid . This initial action of TCDD is accompanied with the up-regulation of an important inflammation marker , P35354 mRNA expression within 1h , and by 3h , several other markers become up-regulated . These effects appear to be dependent on the initial increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca(2+) , and activation of P47712 and P35354 . A comparative study among three different human cell lines showed that activation of P35354 within 1h of action of TCDD is a common feature exhibited by all cell lines . On the other hand , the U937 macrophage line appears to be unique among them with respect to its ability to activate P01375 and P10145 mRNA expressions , and not requiring Src kinase in propagating the initial signaling of P47712 . Based on the rapidity of activation of P47712 and P35354 , which occurs within 1h of cell exposure to TCDD , when no change in mRNA expression of P04798 has been observed , it is apparent that this unique action of TCDD is carried out through a distinct " nongenomic " pathway which , is clearly discernable from the classical , " genomic " action pathway of the P35869 by not requiring the participation of P27540 . Release of cytokines by blood monocytes during strenuous exercise . During strenuous exercise in endurance athletes , monocytes are activated and there is an acute inflammation and hypoxemia possibly due to lesional pulmonary edema . P05231 and P01375 released by monocytes may be implicated in the acute phase of lesional pulmonary edema . A study was carried out to determine whether P01375 and P05231 are released during strenuous exercise , and , if adrenalin released during exercise alters their generation . Ten young and six master athletes underwent an incremental exercise test . Arterial blood was drawn at rest , at the end of the exercise , and 20 minutes afterwards . Monocytes were isolated and incubated for 18 hours in the presence or absence of adrenalin . Il-6 and P01375 were measured in monocyte supernatants . The spontaneous release of P05231 or P01375 was increased in young athletes when compared to older subjects . The spontaneous release of P01375 was increased , but not significantly , by exercise and there was no correlation between the release of P05231 and P01375 and lung function measured during hypoxemia . DB00668 inhibited the release of P05231 or P01375 . Correlations were observed between the in vitro release of P05231 or P01375 and age , VO2max , maximal ventilation and maximal power output of the subjects . DB00642 : its promise in treating non-small-cell lung cancer . The use of chemotherapy in the treatment of early and advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) has increased during the past decade . One of the main reasons for the increased acceptance of chemotherapy is the development of several new cytotoxic agents with a unique mechanism(s) of action and high single-agent activity , combined with a favorable toxicity profile . DB00642 ( Alimta ) is a novel antifolate that inhibits several enzymes involved in DNA synthesis ( thymidylate synthase [ TS ] , dihydrofolate reductase [ P00374 ] , and glycinamide ribonucleotideformyltransferase [ GARFT ] ) . DB00642 's toxicity is markedly reduced by folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation . The compound has been studied extensively in various tumor types , including NSCLC . In NSCLC , pemetrexed at 500 mg/m2 , every 3 weeks , given i.v. over 10 minutes , has shown promising activity , and can safely be administrated with vitamin supplementation . After registration , single-agent pemetrexed will certainly add to the chemotherapeutic options available for pretreated patients and will most likely change significantly chemotherapy prescriptions in second-line chemotherapy . In first-line chemotherapy , the role of platinum-based and -free combination doublet chemotherapy with pemetrexed still needs to be defined . Phase II data indicate high efficacy combined with favorable toxicity for pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin , carboplatin ( DB00958 ) , oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin ) , gemcitabine ( Gemzar ) , and vinorelbine ( Navelbine ) . This review summarizes the clinical experience obtained thus far during the early clinical development of pemetrexed in NSCLC . Determination of fenofibric acid concentrations by HPLC after anion exchange solid-phase extraction from human serum . Triglycerides are increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease . Research efforts to identify sources of variability in triglyceride-lowering response to the lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate require quantification of the active acidic form of this Q07869 agonist . Anion-exchange solid-phase extraction , in combination with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) , rapidly and accurately determines steady-state fenofibric acid serum concentrations . Chromatographic separation under isocratic conditions , with use of ultraviolet detection at 285 nm , provides clean baseline and sharp peaks for clofibric acid , 1-napthyl acetic acid ( internal standards ) , and fenofibric acid . Commonly prescribed and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) were screened for assay interference , and the assay was employed to quantify fenofibric acid in more than 800 human subject specimens . DB01039 analysis was found to be linear over the range of 0.5 to 40 mg/L and was validated with either internal standard . Accuracies ranged from 98.65 % to 102.4 % , whereas the within- and between-day precisions ranged from 1.0 % to 2.2 % and 2.0 % to 6.2 % , respectively . NSAIDs had minimal interference with the assay , which succeeded in quantifying fenofibric acid in more than 843 of 846 serum samples from human subjects , many taking a variety of coadministered medications . Anion-exchange solid-phase extraction in combination with reverse-phase HPLC accurately determines steady-state fenofibric acid serum concentrations in humans without interference from NSAIDs or commonly administered medications . This method is suitable for quantification of fenofibric acid for clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients with dyslipidemia . Growth factors expression in patients with erosive esophagitis . Although the pathogenesis and treatment of erosive esophagitis ( EE ) is well recognized , little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of mucosal healing in EE patients . In this pilot study , we enrolled typical EE patients to evaluate what kinds of growth factors and their receptors were activated in their injured esophageal mucosa . Forty endoscopically proved EE patients were consecutively enrolled . Messenger RNA expressions , which includes keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) and its receptor ( P21802 ) , epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) and its receptor ( HGFR ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 , were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Data were compared between the injured EE mucosa and their normal esophageal mucosa above EE . The mRNA expressions of P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and P35354 , but not P00533 , KGF , P21802 , P09038 , and P23219 , were significantly increased in the injured mucosa of EE patients compared with those of normal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) . The study found that P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and , P35354 are activated in the injured mucosa of EE patients ; their activation might be involved in mucosal repair and ulcer healing of EE . Translational research with pemetrexed in breast cancer . DB00642 ( Alimta ) is a novel folate antimetabolite that primarily inhibits the enzymes thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase ( GARFT ) , all of which are involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis . In a phase II trial of patients with DB00279 /4 , N0-2 breast cancer , expression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , p53 , and c-erb-B2 ( at the mRNA or protein level ) was examined in tumor biopsy specimens before and 24 hours after the first dose of pemetrexed and after three cycles of single-agent treatment to establish correlations of biomarker levels and changes with clinical outcome and toxicity . Although final data are not available , initial indications are that clinical response may correlate with decreased or low TS expression . The results obtained from clinical data are supported by laboratory results in three cell lines ( MDA-231 , MCF-7 , and ZR-75 ) . These results suggest that in vitro transcript profiling to identify which genes are important predictors of successful cytotoxic chemotherapy , followed by a focused clinical trial to confirm the in vitro results , may be the best approach for translational research . Differential involvement of Galpha16 in CC chemokine-induced stimulation of phospholipase Cbeta , P29323 , and chemotaxis . Chemokines are known to regulate the chemotaxis of leukocytes and play an important role in immunological processes . Chemokine receptors are widely distributed in hematopoietic cells and are often co-localized with the hematopoietic-specific G(16) and its close relative , G(14) . Yet , many chemokine receptors utilize pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) proteins for signaling . Given that both G(16) and G(14) are capable of linking G(i)-coupled receptors to the stimulation of phospholipase Cbeta , we examined the capacity of six CC chemokine receptors ( P32246 , CCR2a , CCR2b , P51677 , P51681 and P32248 ) to interact with G(14) and G(16) in a heterologous expression system . Among the CC chemokine receptors tested , P32246 , CCR2b , and P51677 were capable of mediating chemokine-induced stimulation of phospholipase Cbeta via either G(14) or G(16) . The G(14)/G(16)-mediated responses exhibited CC chemokine dose-dependency and were resistant to pertussis toxin ( PTX ) treatment . In contrast , CCR2a , P51681 and P32248 were unable to interact with G(14) and G(16) . Under identical experimental conditions , all six CC chemokine receptors were fully capable of inhibiting adenylyl cyclase via G(i) as well as stimulating phospholipase Cbeta via 16z44 , a G(16/z) chimera that possesses increased promiscuity toward G(i)-coupled receptors . Moreover , P32246 -mediated P27361 /2 phosphorylation was largely PTX-insensitive in THP-1 monocytic cells that endogenously express Galpha(16) . In addition , P32246 agonist was less efficacious in mediating chemotaxis of THP-1 cells following the knockdown of Galpha(16) by overexpressing siRNA , indicating the participation of Galpha(16) in P32246 -induced cell migration . These results show that different CC chemokine receptors can discriminate against G(14) and G(16) for signal transduction .
Role of chronic inhibition of dopamine-metabolizing enzymes in the regulation of renal sodium and phosphate excretion in the rat remnant kidney . BACKGROUND/AIMS : The present study examined the effects of chronic selective or combined inhibition of type A monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) and catechol-O-methyltransferase ( P21964 ) on daily urinary excretion of dopamine and metabolites and on natriuresis and phosphaturia in 3/4 nephrectomized ( 3/4nx ) and Sham rats . METHODS : The 3/4nx and Sham rats were placed in metabolic cages and received the P21397 -selective inhibitor Ro-411049 ( 7.5 mg x kg(-1) bid ) and/or the P21964 -selective inhibitor DB03336 3-202 ( 30 mg x kg(-1) bid ) orally for 3 days during high sodium diet . RESULTS : Selective P21964 inhibition increased the urinary excretion of the deaminated metabolite ( 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid , DOPAC ) and decreased the urinary excretion of the methylated ( 3-methoxytyramine , 3-MT ) and deaminated plus methylated metabolite ( homovanillic acid , HVA ) in both groups . Selective P21397 inhibition increased the urinary excretion of 3-MT and reduced the urinary excretion of both DOPAC and HVA in either 3/4nx or Sham rats . Combined inhibition of P21397 and P21964 did not significantly change the urinary excretion of DOPAC and markedly decreased the urinary excretion of 3-MT and HVA in both groups . Selective or combined inhibition of P21397 and P21964 did not alter the daily urinary excretion of dopamine , sodium or phosphate in either 3/4nx or Sham rats . CONCLUSIONS : Chronic selective or combined inhibition of P21397 and P21964 is not of major importance in regulating the dopamine-dependent natriuresis and phosphaturia in either 3/4nx or Sham rats . Cross-talk between PKA-Cβ and p65 mediates synergistic induction of Q07343 by roflumilast and NTHi . Phosphodiesterase 4B ( Q07343 ) plays a key role in regulating inflammation . DB01656 , a phosphodiesterase (PDE)4-selective inhibitor , has recently been approved for treating severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) patients with exacerbation . However , there is also clinical evidence suggesting the development of tachyphylaxis or tolerance on repeated dosing of roflumilast and the possible contribution of Q07343 up-regulation , which could be counterproductive for suppressing inflammation . Thus , understanding how Q07343 is up-regulated in the context of the complex pathogenesis and medications of P48444 may help improve the efficacy and possibly ameliorate the tolerance of roflumilast . Here we show that roflumilast synergizes with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) , a major bacterial cause of P48444 exacerbation , to up-regulate PDE4B2 expression in human airway epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo . Up-regulated PDE4B2 contributes to the induction of certain important chemokines in both enzymatic activity-dependent and activity-independent manners . We also found that protein kinase A catalytic subunit β ( PKA-Cβ ) and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) p65 subunit were required for the synergistic induction of PDE4B2 . PKA-Cβ phosphorylates p65 in a DB02527 -dependent manner . Moreover , Ser276 of p65 is critical for mediating the PKA-Cβ-induced p65 phosphorylation and the synergistic induction of PDE4B2 . Collectively , our data unveil a previously unidentified mechanism underlying synergistic up-regulation of PDE4B2 via a cross-talk between PKA-Cβ and p65 and may help develop new therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of DB05876 inhibitor . Effects of endothelin P25101 receptor antagonism on granulocyte and lymphocyte accumulation in LPS-induced inflammation . Endothelin peptides play active roles in different aspects of inflammation . This study investigates the contribution of endogenous endothelins to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) pulmonary inflammation by assessing the influence of ET(A) receptor antagonism on leukocyte accumulation , granulocyte adhesion molecule expression , and chemokine/cytokine modulation . Local pretreatment with BQ-123 or A-127722 ( 150 pmol ) , two selective and chemically unrelated endothelin ET(A) receptor antagonists , inhibits neutrophil and eosinophil accumulation in LPS-induced pleurisy at 24 h but not neutrophil migration at 4 h . The effect of endothelin antagonism on neutrophil accumulation at 24 h was concomitant with inhibition of eosinophil and P01730 and CD8 T lymphocyte influx . It is surprising that the ET(A) receptor blockade did not inhibit the accumulation of gammadelta T lymphocytes , cells that are important for granulocyte recruitment in this model . Blockade of ET(A) receptors did not influence the expression of adhesion molecules ( CD11b , CD49d ) on granulocytes but abrogated the increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha levels 4 h after LPS stimulation and also markedly inhibited increases in levels of interleukin-6 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine/CXC chemokine ligand 1 but not eotaxin/chemokine ligand 11 . Thus , acting via ET(A) receptors , endogenous endothelins play an important role in early cytokine/chemokine production and on granulocyte and lymphocyte mobilization in LPS-induced pleurisy . In vivo treatments with fulvestrant and anastrozole differentially affect gene expression in the rat efferent ductules . Estrogen plays a key role in maintaining the morphology and function of the efferent ductules . We previously demonstrated that the antiestrogen fulvestrant markedly affected gene expression in the rat efferent ductules . The mechanism of fulvestrant action to modulate gene expression may involve not only the blockade of P03372 and Q92731 estrogen receptors , but also the activation of P03372 and Q92731 when the receptors are tethered to AP-1 or SP1 transcription factors , or the activation of the Q99527 . We therefore compared the effects of two strategies to interfere with estrogen action in the rat efferent ductules : treatment with fulvestrant or with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole . Whereas fulvestrant markedly increased Mmp7 and Q9BX95 , and reduced Nptx1 mRNA levels , no changes were observed with anastrozole . DB00947 caused changes in epithelial morphology that were not seen with anastrozole . DB00947 shifted P09237 immunolocalization in the epithelial cells from the supranuclear to the apical region ; this effect was less pronounced with anastrozole . In vitro studies of (35)S-methionine incorporation showed that protein release was increased , whereas tissue protein content in the efferent ductules of fulvestrant-treated rats was decreased . Although fulvestrant markedly affected gene expression , no changes were observed on AP-1 and SP1 DNA-binding activity . The blockade of ESRs seems to be the major reason explaining the differences between both treatments . At least some of the effects of fulvestrant appear to result from compensatory mechanisms activated by the dramatic changes caused by P03372 blockade . Selective use of multiple vitamin D response elements underlies the 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated negative regulation of the human O15528 gene . The human 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( DB00146 ) 1alpha-hydroxylase , which is encoded by the O15528 gene , catalyzes the metabolic activation of the DB00146 into 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( DB00136 ) , the most biologically potent vitamin D3 metabolite . The most important regulator of O15528 gene activity is DB00136 itself , which down-regulates the gene . The down-regulation of the O15528 gene has been proposed to involve a negative vitamin D response element ( nVDRE ) that is located approximately 500 bp upstream from transcription start site ( TSS ) . In this study , we reveal the existence of two new P11473 -binding regions in the distal promoter , 2.6 and 3.2 kb upstream from the TSS , that bind vitamin D receptor-retinoid X receptor complexes . Since the down regulation of the O15528 gene is tissue- and cell-type selective , a comparative study was done for the new DB00136 -responsive regions in P29320 -293 human embryonic kidney and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that reflect tissues that , respectively , are permissive and non-permissive to the phenomenon of DB00136 -mediated down-regulation of this gene . We found significant differences in the composition of protein complexes associated with these O15528 promoter regions in the different cell lines , some of which reflect the capability of transcriptional repression of the O15528 gene in these different cells . In addition , chromatin architecture differed with respect to chromatin looping in the two cell lines , as the new distal regions were differentially connected with the proximal promoter . This data explains , in part , why the human O15528 gene is repressed in P29320 -293 but not in MCF-7 cells . Relationship of Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) -associated herpesvirus viremia and KS disease in Zimbabwe . The relationship between Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) viremia and KS disease was investigated in 500 subjects who received treatment in Harare , Zimbabwe . Subjects were grouped by results of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 serological tests , KS diagnosis , and KS clinical stage . The plasma KSHV DNA concentration was associated with concomitant KS and HIV-1 infection ( AIDS-KS ; P < .001 ) and AIDS-KS clinical stage ( P=.01 ) . Plasma KSHV DNA levels were greater in AIDS-KS than in matched HIV-1-seronegative KS ( P=.04 ) . The plasma KSHV DNA level was not associated with age , sex , systemic symptoms , or P01730 + lymphocyte count . Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell KSHV DNA concentrations were linearly related ( r2=.44 ; P < .001 ) , and the nucleotide sequence of the P04264 gene highly variable region was identical in both compartments . These findings provide evidence that KSHV viremia is common in advanced AIDS-KS in Zimbabwe and suggest a relationship between KSHV lytic replication and untreated HIV-1 infection . Expression of P20839 and P12268 after transplantation and initiation of immunosuppression . BACKGROUND : DB01024 ( DB00603 ) mediates immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) . Induction of IMPDH activity has been observed in whole blood and erythrocyte samples during immunosuppressive therapy . Information concerning the mechanisms for increased IMPDH activity is limited and the potential implications of induction have been debated . METHODS : Whole blood , P01730 + cell , and reticulocyte samples were collected from 30 renal transplant patients pre- and posttransplantation . The expressions of two IMPDH isoforms , type 1 and 2 , were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and quantified using a housekeeping gene index . The IMPDH activity was determined by ultraviolet high-performance liquid chromatography . RESULTS : Transplantation and the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy was associated with increased P20839 ( 50-88 % , P < 0.0005 ) and decreased P12268 ( 42-56 % , P < 0.0005 ) expression . In P01730 + cells , however , P12268 increased ( 15 % , P=0.009 ) . These changes are probably related to glucocorticoid effects . Two weeks posttransplant , DB00603 -treated patients displayed elevated P20839 and 2 in reticulocytes , suggesting enzyme induction in these cells during prolonged DB00603 therapy . Patients with acute rejection during follow-up demonstrated higher P12268 expression in P01730 + cells pretransplant than nonrejecting patients ( median expression 1.26 vs. 0.87 respectively , P=0.017 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Knowledge of changes in P20839 and 2 expression after transplantation and initiation of immunosuppression is important considering the action of DB00603 on IMPDH and the potential for pharmacodynamic monitoring of DB00603 by measuring IMPDH activity . The expression of P12268 in P01730 + cells pretransplant may be an indicator of immune activation . Contact sensitization to oxazolone : involvement of both interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 in oxazolone-specific Ig and T-cell responses . The synthesis and role of several lymphokines were examined during contact sensitization to oxazolone ( OX ) . Application of OX to the skin of mice increased the delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response to challenge , serum titres of OX-specific IgG1 and IgG2a , and draining lymph node cell ( LNC ) numbers . At day 3 , LN contained detectable interleukin-4 ( P05112 ) , interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) but not P60568 or P08700 mRNAs ; P08700 and higher levels of P05112 , P01579 and GM- P04141 mRNAs were measured after 24 hr culture with anti-CD3 antibody in OX-primed but not unprimed LNC . As a result of sensitization , LNC secreted P08700 constitutively and produced elevated levels of P60568 , P08700 , P05112 and P01579 in response to anti-CD3 antibody ; a similar but weaker lymphokine response was recalled by OX-protein conjugate . P01730 + cells were the major source of the anti-CD3-induced lymphokines except P01579 , which was derived mainly from CD8+ cells . Since both P05112 and P01579 were synthesized by OX-primed LNC in vivo and in vitro , their role was investigated by administering anti-lymphokine antibodies at the time of sensitization . Anti- P05112 treatment reduced OX-specific serum IgG1 titres without affecting IgG2a titres , whereas anti- P01579 treatment reduced IgG2a but not IgG1 titres . Although neither antibody altered DTH responsiveness , anti- P01579 treatment markedly increased P05112 production by P01730 + LNC and reduced P01579 production in vitro , particularly by P01730 + cells . We conclude that endogenous P05112 and P01579 reciprocally influence the isotype of the Ig response to OX and that P01579 also affects the relative levels of P05112 and P01579 synthesis by P01730 + LNC . Endothelin receptor antagonists as disease modifiers in systemic sclerosis . Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) is a multisystem connective tissue disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation , vascular dysfunction and fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs . SSc is clinically diverse both in terms of the burden of skin and organ involvement and the rate of progression of the disease . Recent studies indicate that the endothelin system , especially ET-1 and the P25101 and ETB receptors may play a key role in the pathogenesis of SSc . A new class of drugs , endothelin receptor antagonists has been introduced for treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . DB00559 , a dual endothelin receptor antagonist as well as DB06268 and DB06403 , selective blockers of the P25101 receptor have proven effective in SSc-PAH . This effect may be mediated through both a vasodilatory and antifibrotic effect , thus making these agents attractive as potential disease modifying agents for SSc . P05231 , P01579 and P01375 production by liver-associated T cells and acute liver injury in rats administered concanavalin A . The relationship between the development of acute hepatitis and the production of P01375 P01579 and P05231 by liver-associated T lymphocytes following intravenous injection of concanavalin A ( Con A ) was studied in rats . Following a single injection of Con A , there was a dose and time-dependent correlation in the serum levels of serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , P05231 , P01579 and P01375 . These increases correlated with an increase in the numbers of P01730 + , CD8+ and CD25+ T cells in blood and P01730 + and CD25+ T cells in the liver perfusate , but not with CD8+ T cells in liver perfusate . Increased levels of P05231 , P01579 and P01375 were constitutively produced by liver-associated P01730 + T cells when cultured . In Con A-stimulated cultures , liver-associated P01730 + T cells secreted increasing levels of P01375 in a time-dependent manner following Con A injection , but P01375 production by peripheral blood lymphocytes was transient with peak levels detected at 1 h which then declined over 24 h . Histological examination of the liver revealed fatty change , hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis , with an associated cell infiltrate of neutrophils and P01730 + T cells both in the portal areas and around the central veins . These results support the hypothesis that Con A-induced liver damage is mediated by P01730 + T cells acting within the liver , at least in part through the secretion of P01375 , P01579 and P05231 . Chromosomal localization of the genes encoding P37088 , P62324 , P01579 and P21397 on chicken chromosome 1 by fluorescence in-situ hybridization . Hsp27 regulates epithelial mesenchymal transition , metastasis , and circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer . Defining the mechanisms underlying metastatic progression of prostate cancer may lead to insights into how to decrease morbidity and mortality in this disease . An important determinant of metastasis is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , and the mechanisms that control the process of EMT in cancer cells are still emerging . Here , we report that the molecular chaperone Hsp27 ( P04792 ) drives EMT in prostate cancer , whereas its attenuation reverses EMT and decreases cell migration , invasion , and matrix metalloproteinase activity . Mechanistically , silencing Hsp27 decreased P05231 -dependent P40763 phosphorylation , nuclear translocation , and P40763 binding to the Twist promoter , suggesting that Hsp27 is required for P05231 -mediated EMT via modulation of P40763 /Twist signaling . We observed a correlation between Hsp27 and Twist in patients with prostate cancer , with Hsp27 and Twist expression each elevated in high-grade prostate cancer tumors . Hsp27 inhibition by DB06094 , an antisense therapy currently in phase II trials , reduced tumor metastasis in a murine model of prostate cancer . More importantly , DB06094 treatment decreased the number of circulating tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a phase I clinical trial . Overall , this study defines Hsp27 as a critical regulator of P05231 -dependent and P05231 -independent EMT , validating this chaperone as a therapeutic target to treat metastatic prostate cancer . Serial changes in serum vitamin P04264 , triglyceride , cholesterol , osteocalcin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in patients after hip replacement for fractured neck of femur or osteoarthritis . Serum vitamin P04264 concentrations were measured at presentation ( just before surgery ) and then at weekly intervals for 3 weeks in two groups of elderly patients requiring either hemiarthroplasty for fractured neck of femur ( FON , n = 13 ) or total hip replacement for osteoarthritis of the hip ( OA , n = 16 ) . In comparison with healthy elderly volunteers ( n = 25 ) , serum vitamin P04264 concentrations were significantly lower in both groups at presentation , and fell significantly within 24 h after surgery to concentrations approaching non-detectable , subsequently returning to pre-operative values within 3 weeks . Serum vitamin P04264 tended to be lower in the fracture group both before and after operation , although calculation of a vitamin P04264 -triglyceride ratio reduced the apparent difference as triglyceride concentrations were lower in the fracture group . P02818 concentrations were similar and fell significantly after operation in both groups , returning to pre-operative levels within 7 days . No differences in the two forms of osteocalcin ( carboxylated and undercarboxylated ) were observed either before or after operation in either group . DB00146 concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups at any time . DB01022 status may be lower than desirable in certain groups of the elderly population , and supplementation should be considered as prophylactic therapy . Favorable coagulation profile with fondaparinux after hip surgery in elderly patients . Twenty-three patients with fondaparinux prophylaxis over 75 years of age who underwent hip fracture surgery were enrolled in the study . DB00569 ( 2.5 mg ) was administered subcutaneously 6 h postoperatively and then every 24 h for 28 days . Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were measured preoperatively , then 10 h , 2 , 7 , and 28 days postoperatively . Increased D-dimers , positive acute phase proteins , and P05231 , and decreased negative acute phase proteins were observed preoperatively ( P < 0.05 ) . Maximum values were reached 10 h postoperatively for P05231 and D-dimer , and on postoperative days 2 and 7 for positive acute phase proteins ( P < 0.05 ) . P02787 , prealbumin and antithrombin levels were lowest 10 h postoperatively and on postoperative day 2 ( P < 0.05 ) . Increased D-dimers , P05231 , and positive acute phase proteins , and decreased negative acute phase proteins persisted until postoperative day 28 ( P < 0.05 ) . P00734 fragments ( F1 + 2 ) reached peak levels preoperatively and decreased gradually until postoperative day 28 . Fondaparinux promoted the inhibition of thrombin generation , as documented by negative correlation between F1 + 2 and FXa inhibition ( r = -0.46 ; P < 0.001 ) . Fondaparinux-induced FXa inhibition increased gradually until postoperative day 28 . This increase correlated positively with antithrombin activity ( r = 0.4 ; P < 0.05 ) . Fondaparinux prophylaxis counteracted pro-thrombogenic effect associated with hip fracture and subsequent surgery without severe bleeding complications . DB00174 Synthetase Deficiency : New Inborn Errors of Metabolism . BACKGROUND : DB00174 synthetase deficiency ( P51689 ) is a newly identified neurometabolic disorder characterized by severe congenital microcephaly , severe global developmental delay , intractable seizure disorder , and spastic quadriplegia . Brain Q9BWK5 showed brain atrophy , delayed myelination , and simplified gyriform pattern . METHODS : We report P51689 deficiency in a 2- and 4-year-old sibling . On them , we described clinical , biochemical , and molecular findings , and we compared our results with previously reported cases . RESULTS : We identified a homozygous novel missense mutation in P08243 gene in both probands and we demonstrated low P04141 and plasma asparagine in both patients . CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should suspect P51689 deficiency in any newborn presented with severe congenital microcephaly followed by severe epileptic encephalopathy and global developmental delay . P04141 asparagine level is low in this disorder while plasma may be low . Lack of pharmacokinetic interactions between argatroban and warfarin . The potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between argatroban and warfarin was studied . In a randomized , crossover study , healthy volunteers participated in three treatment periods , each separated by a nine-day washout interval . Drug regimens consisted of a single oral 7.5-mg dose of warfarin , intravenous argatroban infused at a rate of 1.25 micrograms/kg/min for 100 hours , or both . Blood samples were collected at intervals up to 104 hours to determine clearance ( CL ) and the apparent first-order elimination rate constant ( kel ) for argatroban and the area under the concentration-versus-time curve ( AUC ) and maximum concentration ( Cmax ) for R- and S-warfarin . An interaction was defined as a > 25 % difference in the magnitude of the pharmacokinetic values between administration of one drug alone and coadministration with the other agent . Twelve adult subjects were enrolled . The mean CL and lel for argatroban administered alone differed by < 7 % from the mean values when the two drugs were coadministered . When warfarin was administered alone , the mean Cmax and AUC of R- and S-warfarin differed from the mean values when the two drugs were coadministered by < 10 % . P00734 time was prolonged comparably when argatroban was administered alone and with warfarin . No deaths or serious adverse events were reported . No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were detected between i.v. argatroban 1.25 micrograms/kg/min and a single 7.5-mg oral dose of warfarin . DB00278 was well tolerated when administered alone or with warfarin . P09237 facilitates immune access to the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis . BACKGROUND : Metalloproteinase inhibitors can protect mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , an animal model for multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . P14780 ( P14780 ) has been implicated , but it is not clear if other MMPs are also involved , including matrilysin/ P09237 - an enzyme capable of cleaving proteins that are essential for blood brain barrier integrity and immune suppression . RESULTS : Here we report that P09237 -deficient ( mmp7-/- ) mice on the C57Bl/6 background are resistant to EAE induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( Q16653 ) . Brain sections from Q16653 -primed mmp7-/-mice did not show signs of immune cell infiltration of the CNS , but Q16653 -primed wild-type mice showed extensive vascular cuffing and mononuclear cell infiltration 15 days after vaccination . At the peak of EAE wild-type mice had P09237 immuno-reactive cells in vascular cuffs that also expressed the macrophage markers Iba-1 and Gr-1 , as well as tomato lectin . Q16653 -specific proliferation of splenocytes , lymphocytes , P01730 + and CD8+ cells were reduced in cells isolated from Q16653 -primed mmp7-/- mice , compared with Q16653 -primed wild-type mice . However , the adoptive transfer of splenocytes and lymphocytes from Q16653 -primed mmp7-/- mice induced EAE in naïve wild-type recipients , but not naïve mmp7-/- recipients . Finally , we found that recombinant P09237 increased permeability between endothelial cells in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model . CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that P09237 may facilitate immune cell access or re-stimulation in perivascular areas , which are critical events in EAE and multiple sclerosis , and provide a new therapeutic target to treat this disorder . Enhancement of antibody responses to Bacillus anthracis protective antigen domain IV by use of calreticulin as a chimeric molecular adjuvant . The generation of protective humoral immune responses against the receptor-binding domain ( domain IV ) of protective antigen [ PA(dIV) ] of Bacillus anthracis represents a plausible approach against anthrax toxin . In the current study , we have developed a naked DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin ( CRT ) linked to PA(dIV) of Bacillus anthracis [ CRT/PA(dIV) ] . We transfected a human embryonic kidney cell line ( P29320 293 ) with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA and performed Western blotting and confocal microscopy analysis . We found that linkage of CRT to PA(dIV) targets PA(dIV) to the endoplasmic reticulum , resulting in secretion of the chimeric CRT/PA(dIV) protein . We then evaluated the ability of CRT/PA(dIV) DNA to generate PA(dIV)-specific antibody responses and protective immunity against lethal anthrax toxin ( PA plus lethal factor ) challenge . We found that mice immunized with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA were capable of rapidly inducing significantly higher PA(dIV)-specific antibody responses than mice immunized with PA(dIV) DNA alone . Furthermore , we observed that this enhanced antibody response generated by CRT/PA(dIV) DNA was P01730 dependent , since P01730 knockout mice demonstrated a significant reduction in antibody responses . In addition , analysis of the titers and avidity maturation of the induced PA-specific antibodies revealed that vaccination with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA vaccine accelerated the avidity maturation of antibodies to PA(dIV) compared to vaccination with PA(dIV) DNA . Importantly , the enhanced antibody responses correlated to protective immunity against lethal anthrax toxin challenge . Thus , DNA vaccines encoding CRT linked to PA(dIV) may dramatically enhance PA-specific protective antibody responses . Our results have significant clinical applications for biodefense against anthrax toxin . Differential expression and function of phosphodiesterase 4 ( DB05876 ) subtypes in human primary P01730 + T cells : predominant role of Q08499 . Type 4 phosphodiesterases ( DB05876 ) are critical regulators in TCR signaling by attenuating the negative constraint of DB02527 . In this study , we show that anti-CD3/ P10747 stimulation of human primary P01730 (+) T cells increases the expression of the DB05876 subtypes P27815 , Q07343 , and Q08499 in a specific and time-dependent manner . P27815 and Q08499 mRNAs as well as enzyme activities were up-regulated within 5 days , Q07343 showed a transient up-regulation with highest levels after 24 h . The induction was shown to be independent of different stimulation conditions and was similar in naive and memory T cell subpopulations . To elucidate the functional impact of individual DB05876 subtypes on T cell function , we used DB05876 subtype-specific short-interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) . Knockdown of either Q07343 or Q08499 inhibited P60568 release 24 h after stimulation ( time point of maximal P60568 concentrations ) to an extent similar to that observed with the panPDE4 inhibitor RP73401 ( piclamilast ) . Substantial amounts of P01579 or P05113 were measured only at later time points . siRNA targeting Q08499 showed a predominant inhibitory effect on these cytokines measured after 72 h . However , the inhibition of all cytokines was most effective when DB05876 siRNAs were applied in combination . Although the effect of DB05876 inhibition on T cell proliferation is small , the Q08499 -targeting siRNA alone was as effective as the panPDE4 inhibitor , whereas P27815 or Q07343 siRNAs had hardly an effect . In summary , individual DB05876 subtypes have overall nonredundant , but complementary , time-dependent roles in propagating various T cell functions and Q08499 is the form likely playing a predominant role .
Effect of milk hydrolysates on inflammation markers and drug-induced transcriptional alterations in cell-based models . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) are associated with gastrointestinal inflammation and subsequent damage to the intestinal tissue . Earlier studies in our laboratory have found that specific casein hydrolysates ( CH ) might be useful in the treatment of gastrointestinal wounds . The underlying mechanisms that support inflammation and wound healing are not completely understood , but transcriptional alterations may be used as markers for inflammation and wound healing . The bioactivity of 3 CH prepared by treatment of commercial casein with pepsin ( 60 min ) followed by corolase ( 0 , 10 , or 60 min ) were investigated in intestinal epithelial cells treated with the NSAID indomethacin . The bioactivity was evaluated as transcriptional alterations of transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( Q07869 -γ ) and nuclear factor κB ( NFκB ) by real-time PCR . Furthermore , the effect of CH on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation was evaluated in macrophages by measuring PG E(2) levels . Casein hydrolysates treated with corolase for 10 or 60 min after pepsin treatment downregulated transcription of TGF-β1 and NFκB ( P < 0.05 ) compared with the hydrolysate treated with pepsin only . Hydrolysate prepared by corolase treatment for 60 min after pepsin hydrolysis downregulated transcription of P35354 ( P < 0.05 ) compared with hydrolysate treated with corolase for only 10 min whereas transcription of Q07869 -γ was not affected ( P > 0.05 ) . Additionally , the hydrolysate prepared by pepsin treatment only ( 0 min corolase ) had a pro-inflammatory effect on macrophages via PG E(2) stimulation ( P < 0.05 ) . In conclusion , CH produced by a combination of pepsin and corolase treatments downregulated the transcription levels of TGF-β1 , P35354 , and NFκB . P00734 kringle-2 induces death of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in vivo and in vitro via microglial activation . We have shown that prothrombin kringle-2 ( pKr-2 ) , a domain of human prothrombin distinct from thrombin could activate cultured rat brain microglia in vitro . However , little is known whether pKr-2-induced microglial activation could cause neurotoxicity on dopaminergic ( DA ) neurons in vivo . To address this question , pKr-2 was injected into the rat substantia nigra ( SN ) . Tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) immunohistochemistry experiments demonstrate significant loss of DA neurons seven days after injection of pKr-2 . In parallel , pKr-2-activated microglia were detected in the SN with OX-42 and OX-6 immunohistochemistry . Reverse transcription PCR and double-label immunohistochemistry revealed that activated microglia in vivo exhibit early and transient expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and several proinflammatory cytokines . The pKr-2-induced loss of SN DA neurons was partially inhibited by the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride , and the P35354 inhibitor DuP-697 . P27361 /2 , c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were activated in the SN as early as 1 hr after pKr-2 injection , and localized within microglia . Inhibition of these kinases led to attenuation of mRNA expression of P35228 , P35354 and several proinflammatory cytokines , and rescue of DA neurons in the SN . Intriguingly , following treatment with pKr-2 in vitro , neurotoxicity was detected exclusively in co-cultures of mesencephalic neurons and microglia , but not microglia-free neuron-enriched mesencephalic cultures , indicating that microglia are required for pKr-2 neurotoxicity . Our results strongly suggest that microglia activated by endogenous compound(s) , such as pKr-2 , are implicated in the DA neuronal cell death in the SN . A real time quantitative PCR analysis and correlation of P23219 and P35354 enzymes in inflamed dental pulps following administration of three different NSAIDs . Dental pain is encountered daily by clinicians . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) commonly used for pain management are traditionally cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors , and more recently selective P35354 inhibitors . This study was designed to identify and quantify P23219 and P35354 gene expression level in inflamed rat molar pulps after administration of three NSAIDs : DB00482 , Vioxx , and DB01050 . Fifty male Wistar rats had their first and second molar pulps exposed and sealed with Cavit for 4 days . Rats were randomly divided into the three drug groups and two control groups . RNA was isolated from the rat pulps . Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction assay , a relatively new PCR technique , was used to quantify P23219 and P35354 mRNA . Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant differences in P23219 and P35354 levels among the drug groups . However , Vioxx and DB01050 significantly reduced P35354 expression levels compared to inflamed ( positive control ) pulps ( p < 0.05 ) . A phase-1 trial of bexarotene and denileukin diftitox in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . DB00004 , a genetically engineered fusion protein combining the enzymatically active domains of diphtheria toxin and the full-length sequence for interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) , efficiently targets lymphoma cells expressing the high-affinity P60568 receptor ( IL-2R ) consisting of the alpha/p55/CD25 , beta/p75/CD122 , and gamma/ P31785 /CD132 chains . In vitro studies demonstrated that the retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) retinoid , bexarotene , at biologically relevant concentrations of 10(-6) M to 10(-8) M , upregulated both the p55 and p75 subunits of the IL-2R and enhanced 5- to 10-fold the susceptibility of T-cell leukemia cells to denileukin diftitox . To determine whether this biomodulatory effect could be recapitulated in vivo , we treated 14 patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with escalating doses of bexarotene ( 75 mg/day-300 mg/day ) and denileukin diftitox ( 18 mcg/kg per day x 3 days every 21 days ) in a phase 1 trial . Overall response was 67 % ( 4 complete responses , 4 partial responses ) . Modulation of IL-2R expression was observed at or above a bexarotene dose of 150 mg/day . Four patients experienced grade 2 or 3 leukopenia , and 2 had grade 4 lymphopenia . Our results demonstrate that the combination of denileukin diftitox and bexarotene is well tolerated and that even low doses ( 150 mg/day ) of bexarotene are capable of in vivo upregulation of CD25 expression on circulating leukemia cells . [ P35354 inhibitor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , myth or reality ? ] . The discovery of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase , Cox-1 constitutive and Cox-2 inducible , has prompted the development of new molecules with high Cox-2 selectivity . These new NSAIDs belong to the coxib class and have theoretically a better digestive tolerability than classical NSAID have . In Belgium , rofecoxib ( ( Vioxx ) and celecoxib ( DB00482 ) are commercialized . DB00533 is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis ( 12.5 to 25 mg/d ) and celecoxib is indicated in osteoarthritis ( 200 mg/d ) and in rheumatoid arthritis ( 200 to 400 mg/d ) . Several studies have demonstrated their efficacy , similarly to classical NSAID as diclofenac ( Voltaren ) , naproxen ( Naprosyne ) , ibuprofen ( DB01050 ) and their superiority compared to placebo . Their safety profile for gastrointestinal events is proven in patients without ulcer history compared to classical NSAID . However , the concomitant use of aspirin decreases the benefit as demonstrated for celecoxib at 400 mg/d but not investigated for rofecoxib . The selective inhibition of Cox-2 with no effect on Cox-1 favors cardiovascular events in patients at risk . Other side effects are similar to classical NSAID . Thus Cox-2 inhibitors NSAID are interesting molecules for their sparing gastrointestinal activity . They must be used with caution in patients with ulcer history , in the elderly and in patients requiring aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis . Regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression by heat : a novel aspect of heat shock factor 1 function in human cells . The heat-shock response , a fundamental defense mechanism against proteotoxic stress , is regulated by a family of heat-shock transcription factors ( HSF ) . In humans Q00613 is considered the central regulator of heat-induced transcriptional responses . The main targets for Q00613 are specific promoter elements ( HSE ) located upstream of heat-shock genes encoding cytoprotective heat-shock proteins ( HSP ) with chaperone function . In addition to its cytoprotective function , Q00613 was recently hypothesized to play a more complex role , regulating the expression of non-HSP genes ; however , the non-canonical role of Q00613 is still poorly understood . Herein we report that heat-stress promotes the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , a key regulator of inflammation controlling prostanoid and thromboxane synthesis , resulting in the production of high levels of prostaglandin-E(2) in human cells . We show that heat-induced P35354 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level via Q00613 -mediated signaling and identify , by in-vitro reporter gene activity assay and deletion-mutant constructs analysis , the P35354 heat-responsive promoter region and a new distal cis-acting HSE located at position -2495 from the transcription start site . As shown by ChIP analysis , Q00613 is recruited to the P35354 promoter rapidly after heat treatment ; by using shRNA-mediated Q00613 suppression and HSE-deletion from the P35354 promoter , we demonstrate that Q00613 plays a central role in the transcriptional control of P35354 by heat . Finally , P35354 transcription is also induced at febrile temperatures in endothelial cells , suggesting that Q00613 -dependent P35354 expression could contribute to increasing blood prostaglandin levels during fever . The results identify P35354 as a human non-classical heat-responsive gene , unveiling a new aspect of Q00613 function . Heart allograft protection with low-dose carbon monoxide inhalation : effects on inflammatory mediators and alloreactive T-cell responses . BACKGROUND : DB11588 ( CO ) , a byproduct of heme catalysis , has lately received considerable attention as a regulatory molecule in cellular and biological processes . CO has been shown to provide potent protection against a variety of tissue injuries . We hypothesized in this study that low concentration CO would be beneficial for organ allografts , which frequently undergo several types of injury such as ischemia/reperfusion , alloimmune reaction , and inflammation METHODS : The efficacy of low-dose CO was examined in a fully allogeneic LEW to BN rat heterotopic heart transplantation ( HHTx ) model . Recipients were kept in air or exposed to low-dose CO ( 20 ppm ) for 14 , 28 , or 100 days after HHTx under short-course tacrolimus RESULTS : CO treatment ( d0-28 , 0-100 ) was remarkably effective in prolonging heart allograft survival to a median of > 100 from 45 days in the air-control group , with significant reductions of arteritis , fibrosis , and cellular infiltration , including macrophages and T cells . CO inhibited intragraft upregulation of Th1 type cytokines ( P60568 , IFNgamma ) , proinflammatory mediators ( IL-1beta , TNFalpha , P05231 , P35354 ) , and adhesion molecule . Shorter CO exposure in early ( 0-13d ) and late ( 14-28d ) posttransplant periods also prolonged graft survival , with a significant inhibition of inflammatory mediators CONCLUSIONS : These results show that low dose CO inhalation protects heart allografts and can considerably prolong their survival . CO appears to function via multiple mechanisms , including direct inhibition of Th1 type cytokine production and regulation of inflammatory responses . Effects of external calcium on the biotransformation of DB06749 to ginsenoside Rd by Paecilomyces bainier 229-7 . DB01373 is a known signalling molecule in eukaryotic cells and plays a central role in the regulation of many cellular processes . In the following study , we report on the effect of external calcium treatments on the biotransformation of DB06749 to ginsenoside Rd by Paecilomyces bainier 229-7 . We observed that the intracellular calcium content of P. bainier 229-7 mycelia was increased in response to exposure to high external Ca(2+) concentrations . Both ginsenoside Rd biotransformation and β-glucosidase activity were both found to be dependent on the external calcium concentration . At an optimal Ca(2+) concentration of 45 mM , maximal ginsenoside Rd bioconversion rate of 92.44 % was observed and maximal β-glucosidase activity of 0.1778 U was reached in a 72-h biotransformation . The Ca(2+) channel blocker Verapamil blocked the trans-membrane influx of calcium and decreased ginsenoside Rd biotransformatiom . In addition , β-glucosidase activity and ginsenoside Rd content decreased by 36.0 and 29.2 % respectively after a 72-h incubation in the presence of 0.05 mM P62158 ( P62158 ) antagonist DB00850 . These results suggest that both Ca(2+) channels and P62158 are involved in ginsenoside Rd biotransformation via regulation of β-glucosidase activity . This is the first report regarding the effects of calcium signal transduction on biotransformation and enzyme activity in fungi . Preliminary evidence of ethnic divergence in associations of putative genetic variants for methamphetamine dependence . Research into the biological processes that increase susceptibility to methamphetamine dependence has been conducted primarily in Asian populations . Using a case-control design this study 's purpose was to explore , among a population of methamphetamine-dependent Caucasians , six putative single nucleotide polymorphisms previously found to be associated with methamphetamine dependence in Asian populations . A total of 193 non-psychotic males ( 117 methamphetamine-dependent and 76 controls ) were genotyped for variants located in six genes ( P31749 , P32121 , P23560 , P21964 , P09211 , P35372 ) . Genotypic and allelic frequencies , odds ratios , and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated . None of the putative gene associations was significantly replicated in our sample of Caucasian men . Effect size comparisons suggest a trend toward allelic divergence for arrestin beta 2 ( P32121 ) and glutathione S-transferase P1 ( P09211 ) and allelic convergence for brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) . Results provide preliminary support for further exploration and validation of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for methamphetamine ( METH ) dependence reported among Asian populations across other ethnic/ancestral groups . DB03758 activates heat shock protein expression and cardioprotection in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes . Heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) constitute an endogenous cellular defense mechanism against environmental stresses . In the past few years , studies have shown that overexpression of HSPs can protect cardiac myocytes against ischemia-reperfusion injury . In an attempt to increase the HSPs in cardiac tissue , we used the compound radicicol that activates HSP expression by binding to the P08238 kDa ( HSP90 ) . HSP90 is the main component of the cytosolic molecular chaperone complex , which has been implicated in the regulation of the heat shock factor 1 ( Q00613 ) . Q00613 is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the heat shock genes . In the present study , we show that radicicol induces HSP expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes , and this increase in HSPs confers cardioprotection to these cardiomyocytes . We also show that radicicol induction of the HSP and cardioprotection is dependent on the inhibition of HSP90 in cardiomyocytes . These results indicate that modulation of the active HSP90 protein level plays an important role in cardioprotection . Therefore , compounds , such as radicicol and its possible derivatives that inhibit the function of HSP90 in the cell may represent potentially useful cardioprotective agents . P35372 and P20813 gene variants as risk factors in methadone-related deaths . DB00333 is a medication valued for its effectiveness in the treatment of heroin addiction ; however , many fatal poisonings associated with its use have been reported over the years . We have examined the association between P20813 and micro-opioid receptor ( P35372 ) gene variations and apparent susceptibility to methadone poisoning . Genomic DNA was extracted from postmortem whole blood of 40 individuals whose deaths were attributed to methadone poisoning . The presence of P20813 *4,*9 , and *6 alleles and the P35372 A118G variant was determined by SNP genotyping . P20813 *4 , *9 , and *6 alleles were found to be associated with higher postmortem methadone concentrations in blood ( P < or = 0.05 ) . P35372 A118G was also associated with higher postmortem methadone concentrations in blood but not to a level of statistical significance ( P = 0.39 ) . In these methadone-related deaths , P35372 118GA was associated with higher postmortem benzodiazepine concentrations ( P = 0.04 ) , a finding not associated with morphine-related deaths . The risk of a methadone-related fatality during treatment may be evaluated in part by screening for P20813 *6 and A118G . Interpretation of point-of-care INR results in patients treated with dabigatran . BACKGROUND : Point-of-care devices for measurement of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) are commonly used to monitor therapy and maintain therapeutic levels of anticoagulation in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists . DB06695 , a new oral , reversible direct thrombin inhibitor approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation does not require routine coagulation monitoring . However , case reports have identified falsely elevated point-of-care INR levels in patients treated with dabigatran using one of these devices ( Hemochron ) . This in vitro study was designed to verify this issue . METHODS : We compared INR levels in whole blood and plasma using a Hemochron Jr . Signature+ point-of-care device ( International Technidyne Corporation , Edison , NJ ) with routine laboratory monitoring , using blood from healthy volunteers that was spiked with increasing concentrations of dabigatran . RESULTS : P00734 time and INR levels were increased about 2- to 4-fold with the point-of-care device compared with laboratory measures across the plasma dabigatran concentration range 50-1400 ng/mL . At plasma concentrations of dabigatran likely to be observed in patients , at a dose of 150 mg twice daily ( 60-275 ng/mL ) , whole blood point-of-care INR values increased from 1.7 to 4.0 , versus 1.1 to 1.5 measured with the laboratory coagulometer . Similar differences in prothrombin time were observed in plasma samples . CONCLUSIONS : INR levels in patients taking dabigatran are substantially higher using a Hemochron Jr. point-of-care device compared with laboratory values . We discourage the use of these devices specifically , as well as the use of the INR in general , for measuring the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran . Dietary phytochemicals alter epigenetic events and signaling pathways for inhibition of metastasis cascade : phytoblockers of metastasis cascade . Cancer metastasis is a multistep process in which a cancer cell spreads from the site of the primary lesion , passes through the circulatory system , and establishes a secondary tumor at a new nonadjacent organ or part . Inhibition of cancer progression by dietary phytochemicals ( DPs ) offers significant promise for reducing the incidence and mortality of cancer . Consumption of DPs in the diet has been linked to a decrease in the rate of metastatic cancer in a number of preclinical animal models and human epidemiological studies . DPs have been reported to modulate the numerous biological events including epigenetic events ( noncoding micro-RNAs , histone modification , and DNA methylation ) and multiple signaling transduction pathways ( Wnt/β-catenin , Notch , Sonic hedgehog , P35354 , P00533 , MAPK- P29323 , JAK- P35610 , Akt/PI3K/ P42345 , NF-κB , AP-1 , etc. ) , which can play a key role in regulation of metastasis cascade . Extensive studies have also been performed to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying antimetastatic activity of DPs , with results indicating that these DPs have significant inhibitory activity at nearly every step of the metastatic cascade . DPs have anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis and by inhibiting cell growth , migration , invasion , and angiogenesis . Growing evidence has also shown that these natural agents potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways . In this review , we discuss the variety of molecular mechanisms by which DPs regulate metastatic cascade and highlight the potentials of these DPs as promising therapeutic inhibitors of cancer . The analgesic efficacy of valdecoxib vs. oxycodone/acetaminophen after oral surgery . BACKGROUND : The authors conducted two studies to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of the cyclooxygenase , or P36551 , -2-specific inhibitor , valdecoxib , with oxycodone/ acetaminophen in patients who have undergone oral surgery . METHODS : In total , 205 eligible subjects in Study A and 201 in Study B were randomized to receive a single oral dose of valdecoxib ( 20 or 40 milligrams ) , a combination of oxycodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 1,000 mg or placebo . Eligible subjects experienced moderate-to-severe pain within six hours of surgery during which two or more impacted third molars were extracted . Analgesic efficacy was assessed over 24 hours or until the patient required rescue analgesia . RESULTS : In both studies , subjects receiving either dose of valdecoxib experienced a rapid onset of analgesia and ( among those who received valdecoxib 40 mg ) a level of pain relief comparable with that of those who received oxycodone/ acetaminophen . Both valdecoxib doses had a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect than did oxycodone/acetaminophen . Pooled safety data demonstrated that each valdecoxib dose had a tolerability profile superior to that of oxycodone/ acetaminophen and similar to that of placebo . CONCLUSIONS : Orally administered valdecoxib is as rapidly acting and effective as oxycodone/acetaminophen , and it has a superior duration of analgesic effect in patients after oral surgery . DB00580 has a tolerability profile superior to that of oxycodone/acetaminophen . CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS : The current standard of care for alleviating acute pain after oral surgery has rested largely on conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioid/analgesic combination products . The studies reported here suggest that the P35354 -specific inhibitor valdecoxib offers an efficacious and safe alternative to other analgesics used to treat pain after oral surgery . P62158 -mediated effects of loperamide on chloride transport by brush border membrane vesicles from human ileum . We investigated whether the synthetic opiate loperamide-HCl is able to regulate specific transport systems for sodium and chloride in brush border membrane vesicles ( BBMVs ) from human ileum and whether such activities are mediated by calcium/calmodulin . In BBMVs we studied Na+/H+ antiport , Cl+/OH- antiport , Na+/Cl- cotransport , and the Cl- conductive pathway . Brush border membrane vesicles were incubated with 10 microM loperamide over 4 h at 5 degrees C before the uptake experiments . In ileal BBMVs , loperamide stimulated intravesicular accumulation of Na+ in the presence of Cl- and vice versa . After 1 min of incubation , the stimulatory effect was 35 % +/- 5 % ( p less than 0.005 ) of the control without loperamide . DB00836 also stimulated Cl-/OH- antiport by 30 % +/- 5 % ( p less than 0.005 ) in BBMVs of ileum . In addition , we studied the role of Ca2+/calmodulin in the action of loperamide on chloride transport by human BBMVs . In loperamide-pretreated BBMVs , calmodulin activity was significantly decreased ( 12 +/- 2 vs. 38 +/- 4 pmol/mg protein ) . When loperamide-pretreated vesicles were incubated with 2 microM calcium ( free concentration ) plus 5 microM calmodulin for 1 h at 5 degrees C , complete inhibition of the stimulatory effect of loperamide on Cl-/OH- antiport and Na+/Cl- cotransport was observed . Increasing the Ca2+/calmodulin activity of loperamide-pretreated BBMVs with 2 microM calcium plus 5 microM calmodulin led to a significant inhibition of Cl-/OH- antiport and Na+/Cl- cotransport by 40 % +/- 5 % ( p less than 0.005 ) . DB01411 inhibits renal epithelial cyst progression via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase . Q9Y271 ( CysLT1 receptor ) antagonists were found to inhibit chloride secretion in human airway epithelial cells . Since chloride secretion in renal epithelial cells , which shares common mechanisms with airway epithelial cells , plays important roles in renal cyst progression in polycystic kidney disease ( Q15139 ) , this study was aimed to investigate effects of drugs acting as CysLT1 receptor antagonists on renal cyst progression and its underlying mechanisms . Effects of CysLT1 receptor antagonists on renal cyst growth and formation were determined using Madine Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cyst models . Mechanisms of actions of CysLT1 receptor antagonists were determined using short-circuit current measurement , assays of cell viability and cell proliferation , and immunoblot analysis of signaling proteins . Of the three drugs acting as CysLT1 receptor antagonists ( montelukast , pranlukast and zafirlukast ) tested , pranlukast was the most promising drug that inhibited MDCK cyst growth and formation without affecting cell viability . Its effect was independent of the inhibition of CysLT1 receptors . Instead , it reduced DB02527 -activated chloride secretion and proliferation of MDCK cells in an AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) -dependent manner and had no effect on P13569 protein expression . Interestingly , pranlukast enhanced AMPK activation via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta ( CaMKKβ ) with consequent activation of acetyl- DB01992 carboxylase ( ACC ) and suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway . These results indicate that pranlukast retards renal epithelial cyst progression by inhibiting DB02527 -activated chloride secretion and cell proliferation via CaMKKβ-AMPK- P42345 pathway . Therefore , pranlukast represents a class of known drugs that may have potential utility in Q15139 treatment . Association between P29274 and P14416 polymorphisms and caffeine-induced anxiety . Caffeine produces mild psychostimulant and sometimes anxiogenic effects by antagonizing adenosine at A(1) and A(2A) receptors , and perhaps through interactions with other transmitter systems . DB00640 receptors are colocalized and functionally interact with dopamine receptors in the brain . Thus , functional polymorphisms in the genes for either adenosine or dopamine receptors may affect responses to caffeine . In this study , we examined associations between self-reported anxiogenic effects of caffeine and variation in the genes for A(2A) ( P29274 ) and DRD(2) ( P14416 ) receptors . Healthy male and female individuals ( n=102 ) , who consumed less than 300 mg caffeine per week , ingested capsules containing 0 , 50 , 150 , and 450 mg caffeine under double-blind conditions in four separate experimental sessions . Subjective anxiety was measured before and at repeated times after capsules were consumed . At the 150 mg dose of caffeine , we found a significant association between caffeine-induced anxiety ( Visual Analog Scales , VAS ) and P29274 rs5751876 ( 1976C/T ) , rs2298383 ( intron 1a ) and rs4822492 ( 3'-flank ) , and P14416 rs1110976 ( intron 6 ) . Caffeine-induced anxiety ( VAS ) was also associated with two-loci interactions of selected P29274 and P14416 polymorphisms . The lowest dose of caffeine did not increase ratings of anxiety while the highest dose increased anxiety in the majority of subjects . These findings provide support for an association between an P29274 polymorphism and self-reported anxiety after a moderate dose of caffeine . It is likely that other P29274 and P14416 polymorphisms also contribute to responses to caffeine . Anti-inflammatory activity of Taraxacum officinale . Taraxacum officinale has been widely used as a folkloric medicine for the treatment of diverse diseases . The dried plant was extracted with 70 % ethanol to generate its ethanol extract ( TEE ) . For some experiments , ethyl acetate ( EA ) , n-butanol ( BuOH ) and aqueous ( Aq ) fractions were prepared in succession from TEE . TEE showed a scavenging activity in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) assay , a diminishing effect on intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) level , and an anti-angiogenic activity in the chicken chorioallantoic ( P62158 ) assay . In the carrageenan-induced air pouch model , TEE inhibited production of exudate , and significantly diminished nitric oxide ( NO ) and leukocyte levels in the exudate . It also possessed an inhibitory effect on acetic acid-induced vascular permeability and caused a dose-dependent inhibition on acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing in mice . Suppressive effects of TEE on the production of NO and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated macrophages were also assessed . Among the fractions , the n-butanol fraction ( BuOH ) was identified to be most effective in the P62158 assay . Collectively , Taraxacum officinale contains anti-angiogenic , anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activities through its inhibition of NO production and P35354 expression and/or its antioxidative activity . LG839 : anti-obesity effects and polymorphic gene correlates of reward deficiency syndrome . INTRODUCTION : This study systematically assessed the weight management effects of a novel experimental DNA-customized nutraceutical , LG839 ( LifeGen , Inc. , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . METHODS : A total of 1058 subjects who participated in the overall D.I.E.T. study were genotyped and administered an LG839 variant based on polymorphic outcomes . A subset of 27 self-identified obese subjects of Dutch descent , having the same DNA pattern of four out of the five candidate genes tested ( chi-square analysis ) as the entire data set , was subsequently evaluated . Simple t tests comparing a number of weight management parameters before and after 80 days of treatment with LG839 were performed . RESULTS : Significant results were observed for weight loss , sugar craving reduction , appetite suppression , snack reduction , reduction of late night eating ( all P < 0.01 ) , increased perception of overeating , enhanced quality of sleep , increased happiness ( all P < 0.05 ) , and increased energy ( P < 0.001 ) . Polymorphic correlates were obtained for a number of genes ( P41159 , Q07869 -gamma2 , P42898 , 5- Q13049 , and P14416 genes ) with positive clinical parameters tested in this study . Of all the outcomes and gene polymorphisms , only the P14416 gene polymorphism ( A1 allele ) had a significant Pearson correlation with days on treatment ( r=0.42 , P=0.045 ) . CONCLUSION : If these results are confirmed in additional rigorous , controlled studies , we carefully suggest that DNA-directed targeting of certain regulator genes , along with customized nutraceutical intervention , provides a unique framework and strategic modality to combat obesity . Inhibition of Akt/ P31749 by a P35354 inhibitor induces apoptosis in gastric cancer cells . BACKGROUND/AIM : Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 has been proposed to be a potential mechanism for the chemoprevention of gastrointestinal tumors by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . This study investigates the mechanisms by which the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor SC236 induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cell lines and its downstream signaling pathway . METHODS : Two gastric cancer cell lines , AGS and MKN28 , were treated with SC236 and assessed for cell growth and apoptosis . The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt kinase/protein kinase B ( Akt/ P31749 ) pathways and their downstream signalings were studied in the AGS cell line . RESULTS : SC236 treatment induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells and caused activation of p38 and stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase , but down-regulated Akt/ P31749 . The specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the dominant-negative stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase both failed , while the constitutively active form of Akt/ P31749 was able to block SC236-induced apoptosis . SC236-induced apoptosis was coupled with release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases . CONCLUSION : One of the pathways involved in SC-236-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells is through downregulation of Akt and then release of cytochrome c .
The heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 17- P29372 suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in human cholangiocarcinoma cells . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17- P29372 ) , a heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90 ) inhibitor , on the proliferation , cell cycle , and apoptosis of human cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) cells . Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were measured by the MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis , respectively . Induction of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and Hoechst staining . The expressions of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase ( PARP ) , Bcl-2 , Survivin , and P12004 B1 were detected by Western blot analysis . The activity of caspase-3 was also examined . We found that 17- P29372 inhibited cell growth and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CCA cells together with the down-regulation of Bcl-2 , Survivin and P12004 B1 , and the up-regulation of cleaved PARP . Moreover , increased caspase-3 activity was also observed in CCA cells treated with 17- P29372 . In conclusion , our data suggest that the inhibition of HSP90 function by 17- P29372 may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human CCA . P00747 activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor gene expression in human saphenous vein organ culture . We describe the expression of tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) in saphenous vein culture . Smooth muscle cells ( SMC ) are quiescent in fresh tissue , whereas these cells acquire a proliferating phenotype when venous segments are cultured in the presence of serum . t-PA and P05121 were localized immunohistochemically and quantified using biochemical techniques . t-PA and P05121 mRNA was quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT -- PCR ) assay . Immunostaining showed an increase in the positivity of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) from 10-day tissue culture . Tissue sections from fresh vein showed minimal t-PA and maximal P05121 immunostaining . In contrast , 10-day cultures showed an increase in t-PA and a decline in P05121 staining . Biochemical analysis revealed a 118 % increase in t-PA and a 50 % decrease in P05121 antigen levels from 10-day tissue cultures . RT -- PCR demonstrated that the mRNA encoding t-PA increased , while P05121 decreased after 10 days of culture . In conclusion , venous culture showed an up-regulation of t-PA and a repression of P05121 gene expression during SMC proliferation in the vessel wall . The P05121 repression observed in venous culture is in contrast to the situation observed in human atheroma . A shift in the t-PA/ P05121 balance may have a role in vascular remodeling . [ Effects of octreotide on necrosis of hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in nude mice ] . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : DB00104 , a kind of somatostatin analogue , may inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . This study was to investigate the mechanism of inducing necrosis of HCC xenografts in nude mice by octreotide . METHODS : The proliferation of HepG2 cells was determined by MTT assay . Nude mice bearing HepG2 xenografts were treated with octreotide [ 100 microg times ; ( kg times ; d ) (-1) ] or normal saline ( as control ) for eight weeks . The necrosis of HCC was estimated by histology . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) was detected by immunohistochemistry . Somatostatin receptor 2 ( P30874 ) was quantified by Western blot and located with immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : The proliferation of HepG2 cells was not obviously affected by 24-hour treatment of octreotide ( 0.1-1000 nmol/L ) in vitro . The tumor weight was significantly heavier in octreotide group than in control group [ ( 7.15+/-2.96 ) g vs. ( 4.21+/-3.11 ) g , P < 0.05 ] , while the proportion of necrotic volume was significantly higher in octreotide group than in control group [ ( 81.86+/-0.05 ) % vs. ( 43.75+/-0.06 ) % ,P < 0.05 ] . In contrast with control group , P15692 was undetected in the xenografts in octreotide group . P30874 expression in xenograft sinusoids was similar in both groups . CONCLUSION : With active proliferation of HCC cells , octreotide can induce necrosis in HCC xenografts only through the inhibition of angiogenesis mediated by P30874 in the tumor . Engineering the response to vascular injury : divergent effects of deregulated Q01094 expression on vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells result in endothelial recovery and inhibition of neointimal growth . P01375 -alpha ( P01375 ) is expressed locally in the vessel wall after angioplasty and induces growth arrest and apoptosis in endothelial cells ( ECs ) , thereby delaying reendothelialization . Prior studies have shown that direct antagonism of P01375 , using a systemically administered soluble receptor , can enhance endothelial recovery and reduce neointimal thickening . These studies have also shown that downregulation of the transcription factor Q01094 was a key mechanism of P01375 's effect on ECs . We now show that Ad- Q01094 overexpression at sites of balloon injury accelerates functional endothelial recovery , consistent with the prior in vitro findings . Moreover these studies also reveal divergent effects of P01375 and overexpression of Q01094 on ECs versus VSMCs . P01375 exposure of VSMCs had no affect on proliferation or apoptosis , in contrast to the effect seen in ECs . In Ad- Q01094 -transduced VSMCs , however , P01375 -induced marked apoptosis in contrast to the survival effect seen in ECs . Finally , these studies suggest that differential activation of NF-kappaB may play a key role in mediating these opposing effects . Nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB was markedly attenuated in Ad- Q01094 -transduced VSMCs , whereas it remained active in similarly treated ECs when the cells were exposed to P01375 . These studies reveal that overexpression of Ad- Q01094 primes VSMCs to P01375 -induced apoptosis . Furthermore , Q01094 potentiates VSMC death by blocking antiapoptotic signaling pathway through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation . The divergent responses of VSMCs and ECs to Q01094 overexpression provide unique therapeutic possibilities : simultaneously targeting the cell cycle of two different cell types , within same tissue microenvironment resulting in opposite and biologically complimentary effects . Synthetic delivery system for tuberculosis vaccines : immunological evaluation of the M. tuberculosis 38 kDa protein entrapped in biodegradable P00747 microparticles . Tuberculosis remains a major public health burden which could be ameliorated by effective and well-defined subunit vaccines , particularly because the protective efficacy of current M. bovis BCG vaccines is both unpredictable and variable . The immunodominant 38 kDa antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was entrapped in biodegradable poly ( DL-lactide co-glycolide ) ( P00747 ) microparticles which served as a delivery system . Both cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed and compared with those obtained after immunization with the 38 kDa protein emulsified in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ( IFA ) . Vaccination of mice with a single dose of antigen-loaded microparticles resulted in specific IgG titres peaking after five weeks comparable to those achieved after vaccination with protein emulsified in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ( IFA ) . T-cell responses were found to be superior to those induced with antigen/IFA . The T- and B-cell epitope specificities ad judged with synthetic peptides were identical following immunization with antigen in microparticles or IFA . Differences in adjuvanticity were revealed by measuring antigen-specific IgG1 , IgG2a and antigen-induced P01579 secretion in vitro : substantially higher titres of IgG2a were observed following immunization with antigen/microparticles than with 38 kDa protein/IFA . This was paralleled by a tenfold higher secretion of P01579 in mice injected with antigen/microparticles . Reduction in colony-forming units was not consistent in mice immunized with 38 kDa protein entrapped in microparticles which were subsequently infected with live tubercle bacilli . Taken together these results indicate that biodegradable P00747 microparticles constitute a favorable candidate vaccine delivery system worthy of further assessment in the quest to develop better and defined agents protecting against tuberculosis . In vitro analysis of the E1A-homologous sequences of Q13029 . The Q13029 ( G3B/MTB-Zf ) gene was first isolated based on its ability to bind to the retinoblastoma protein ( P06400 ) . An acidic , approximately 100-amino-acid region around the P06400 -binding motif of Q13029 has structural and antigenic similarity to the conserved sequences of the E1A viral oncogene . We show here that this region interacts specifically with the E1A-binding domain of P06400 . This interaction could be disrupted by E1A or by a peptide of Q13029 homologous to the P20023 motif of E1A which is involved in binding to P06400 family proteins . Also like E1A , Q13029 can form a ternary complex with P06400 and Q01094 . Despite this similarity to E1A , however , Q13029 could not bind to the P06400 family proteins P28749 and Q08999 in vitro . The data show that the Q13029 P20023 motif can mediate differential binding to P06400 family proteins . We also mapped the shared antigenic determinant between Q13029 and E1A to a conserved sequence , designated CE1 , which is located in the C terminus of E1A . Unlike that of P25101 , the CE1 motif of Q13029 is located next to the P20023 motif . Despite this proximity , CE1 and P20023 appear to act independently . The data show similarities as well as differences between the homologous sequences of Q13029 and E1A and contribute to an understanding of the biochemistry of these proteins . Preferred therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : This report reviews the current treatment strategies and the most recent clinical trials in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration . RECENT FINDINGS : The functional and anatomic outcomes achieved in the pivotal ranibizumab trials with monthly injections set the standard for comparison . Since then , various modified dosing regimens with the aim of lessening the treatment burden associated with monthly injections have been investigated . Additionally , level I evidence now exists for the noninferiority of bevacizumab , as compared to ranibizumab , in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) through 1 year of follow-up . DB08885 has emerged as a new anti- vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) therapy showing encouraging treatment results at 1 year . Novel treatments combined with anti- P15692 agents such as localized radiation are currently being investigated . SUMMARY : Anti- P15692 monotherapy remains the preferred therapy for the management of neovascular AMD at the present time . DB08885 is a new , FDA-approved , effective , anti- P15692 agent available for clinical use . Ongoing clinical trials will help determine the optimal dosing regimens for all of these agents , as well as the long-term efficacy and safety of combination therapy modalities . Point mutation of the somatostatin receptor 2 gene in the human small cell lung cancer cell line COR-L103 . The effect of somatostatin ( SS ) on adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( DB01285 ) secretion from COR-L103 cells derived from a human small cell lung carcinoma was examined . SS at 1 microM had no effect on DB01285 secretion from the cells on either short-term or long-term incubation . Studies by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) showed that mRNA transcripts of the somatostatin receptor ( SSTR ) 2 , P32745 and P31391 genes were present in COR-L103 cells . Extra bands were obtained by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis of the P30874 gene Sequence analysis of the P30874 gene demonstrated one point mutation in codon 188 of TGG for tryptophan to TGA for a stop codon causing loss of 182 C-terminal amino acid residues of P30874 . The nucleotide sequences of the P32745 and P31391 genes in COR-L103 cells were normal . Binding studies using 125I-Tyr11-SS-14 showed specific affinity binding sites on COR-L103 cells and mouse pituitary tumor AtT-20 cells . DB00104 acetate suppressed the binding of 125I-Tyr11-SS-14 to these two cell lines , but the Kd of COR-L103 cells ( 160 nM ) was 60-fold higher than that of AtT-20 cells ( 2.6 nM ) . Affinity cross-linking studies using 125I-Tyr11-SS-14 gave three bands of 72 KDa , 55 KDa and 32 KDa from AtT-20 cells , but only two bands of 55KDa and 32kDa from COR-L103 cells . These findings suggest that P30874 is not expressed in the plasma membranes of COR-L103 cells due to a point mutation , but that this may have no influence on the effect of SS on DB01285 secretion . Distribution patterns of P12004 and P01160 in perinatal stages of the developing rat heart . Distribution patterns of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) and atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) were determined immunohistochemically and morphometrically in atrium and ventriculum of the developing rat heart in different stages of the perinatal period . During the prenatal period , P12004 and P01160 were localized in opposite patterns , particularly in trabecular myocytes . A distinct reduction in the percentage of P12004 -positive nuclei was detected starting at day 19 of the prenatal period , and these cells were rarely observed on postnatal days 30 and 60 . In cardiomyocytes , a distinct increase in P01160 positivity was found , whereas P12004 positivity was very low . It is concluded that P12004 expression gradually decreased from prenatal day 19 onwards , whereas P01160 expression increased in atria throughout the prenatal and postnatal periods , except for a decrease in P01160 expression in ventricles from prenatal day 21 onwards . The opposite expression patterns of P12004 and P01160 in trabecular myocytes of ventricles indicate that P01160 may have antimitogenic/antiproliferative effects in trabecular myocytes . Blocking both type A and B endothelin receptors in the kidney attenuates renal injury and prolongs survival in rats with remnant kidney . Renal disease progression in the rat is associated with a time-dependent upregulation of renal endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) gene expression and synthesis . We have previously demonstrated that endothelin A receptor subtype ( P25101 ) blockade in rats with remnant kidney reduced signs of disease activity , suggesting that ET-1 exerts part of its deleterious effects on the kidney through P25101 . No data are available so far on the role of ETB receptor in progressive renal injury . We first studied renal P25101 and ETB receptor gene expression in rats with remnant kidney on days 7 , 30 , and 120 after the surgical procedure . While renal expression of P25101 was unaffected , ETB receptor gene was significantly upregulated with time in rats with remnant kidney , being 3.5-fold and sixfold higher than shamoperated rats at days 30 and 120 . We also evaluated whether DB00559 , a nonpeptidic P25101 and ETB receptor antagonist , offered better protection against renal disease progression than reported for P25101 -selective blockers and whether it improved survival in animals with renal ablation . Two groups of rats with renal mass reduction ( n = 11 each ) were given DB00559 100 mg/kg/d orally or its vehicle ( carboxymethyl cellulose ) beginning day 7 after the surgical procedure and were followed until the death of the vehicle-treated animals . Sham-operated animals comprised the control group . DB00559 partially prevented increases in blood pressure and proteinuria , but had a remarkable protective effect on renal function and significantly prolonged animal survival . These data suggest that blocking both renal P25101 and ETB receptors might have major implications in the treatment of human progressive nephropathies . DB08932 ( Opsumit ) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension . The endothelin pathway is a key pathway for the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Antagonism of this pathway is recommended as initial therapy in low-risk patient with PAH to inhibit fibrosis , cell proliferation , and inflammation caused by endothelin . Prior to October 2013 , ambrisentan , a selective P25101 receptor antagonist and DB00559 , a dual P25101 /ETB antagonist , were the only currently available agents for PAH targeting the endothelin pathway . Based on the results of the SERAPHIN trial , macitentan ( brand name Opsumit® ) , a new P25101 /ETB antagonist , has been US FDA approved to delay disease progression and reduce hospitalizations for PAH . SERAPHIN is the first ERA trial to use an event-driven strategy with a composite primary end point of morbidity or mortality . Previous trials have focused on short-term outcomes , such as improved 6-min walk distance and WHO functional class . P15692 trap as a novel antiangiogenic treatment currently in clinical trials for cancer and eye diseases , and VelociGene- based discovery of the next generation of angiogenesis targets . The concept that tumors can be controlled by directly targeting their vascular supply has finally come of age , because clinical trials using a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks P15692 have demonstrated exciting efficacy in cancer patients , as well as in vascular eye diseases that can lead to blindness . However , data suggest that these current regimens may not provide complete P15692 inhibition and , thus , that the maximum therapeutic potential of P15692 blockade has not yet been achieved . We describe the status of a very potent and high-affinity P15692 blocker , termed the DB08885 , that may provide the opportunity to maximize the potential of P15692 blockade in cancer as well as in vascular eye diseases . We also describe use of the DB08885 as a research tool , when coupled to high-throughput mouse genetics approaches such as VelociGene that can be exploited in strategies to discover and validate the next generation of angiogenesis targets . Effects of systemic injections of vilazodone , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and serotonin 1A receptor agonist , on anxiety induced by predator stress in rats . We examined the effect of DB06684 , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) and serotonin 1A ( 5-HT(1A) ) receptor agonist [ Bartoszyk , G.D. , Hegenbart , R. , Ziegler , H. , 1997. P50402 68843 , a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with selective presynaptic P08908 receptor agonistic properties. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 322 , 147-153. ] , on change in affect following predator stress . DB06684 and vehicle injection ( intraperitoneal ) occurred either 10 min after predator stress ( prophylactic testing ) , or 90 min prior to behavioral testing for the effects of predator stress ( therapeutic testing ) . Predator stress involved unprotected exposure of rats to a domestic cat . Behavioral effects of stress were evaluated with hole board , plus-maze , and acoustic startle tests 1 week after stress . Predator stress increased anxiety-like behavior in the plus-maze and elevated response to acoustic startle . In prophylactic testing , DB06684 affected stress potentiation of startle at doses above 5 mg/kg . DB06684 increased stress elevation of startle at 10 mg/kg . Higher doses of DB06684 ( 20 and 40 mg/kg ) blocked stress potentiation of startle . In contrast , DB06684 had no effect on stress potentiation of anxiety in the plus-maze . In therapeutic testing , DB06684 increased stress elevation of startle at all doses . In contrast , therapeutic DB06684 had no effect on stress potentiation of anxiety in the plus-maze . Taken together , the data suggest a prophylactic potential for DB06684 in the treatment of changes in hypervigilance following severe stress . DB11558 inhalation-induced adrenocortical hypertrophy and endocrinological changes in rat . Rats were exposed to toluene ( 1,500 ppm for 4 hr per day ) for 7 days . The body weight of the rats was significantly lower and the weight of the adrenal gland was significantly higher in the toluene inhalation group compared to the controls . Microscopically , there was no obvious change in the medulla , but hypertrophy of the cortex was observed in the toluene inhalation group . And , the size of adrenocortical cells in treated-rats was also significantly enlarged than the control . Immunohistochemical staining did not show a clear difference in localization of aldosterone-positive cells between the control and inhalation groups . Expansion of the corticosterone-positive area consistent with the cortical hypertrophy was recognized in the inhalation group . Enhancement of 72 kD-heat-shock protein ( HSP70 ) -expression in the toluene inhalation group was not observed . Neither stress nor damage to cortical cells due directly to toluene exposure was observed in the cortex . Also , there was no obvious difference in the anti-proliferating cell nucleus antigen ( P12004 ) -immunostaining between control and inhalation groups . Thus , it is suspected that cortical hypertrophy was the result of cell enlargement due to the stimulation of the cortical cells . P06850 ( CRF ) immunoreactivity in the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) was increased in the inhalation group . Concentration of plasma DB01285 was elevated significantly by toluene exposure . The amounts of mRNA of adrenocortical steroid metabolism gene , cytochrome side-chain cleavage ( P450scc ) , was also increased by toluene inhalation . DB11558 exposure might induce adrenocortical hypertrophy via the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland ( Q9Y251 ) axis . Q01094 -mediated transcriptional inhibition of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 gene . Gene expression of the plasminogen activation system is cell-cycle dependent . Previously , we showed that ectopic expression of Q01094 repressed the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( P05121 ) promoter in a manner dependent on the presence of DNA-binding and transactivation domains of Q01094 but independent of binding to pocket-binding proteins , suggesting a novel mechanism for E2F-mediated negative gene regulation [ Koziczak , M. , Krek , W. & Nagamine , Y. ( 2000 ) Mol. Cell. Biol. 20 , 2014-2022 ] . However , it remains to be seen whether endogenous E2F can exert a similar effect . We report here that down-regulation of P05121 gene expression correlates with an increase in endogenous E2F activity . When cells were treated with a cdk2/4-specific inhibitor , which maintains E2F in an inactive state , the decline of serum-induced P05121 mRNA levels was suppressed . In mutant U2OS cells expressing a temperature-sensitive retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) , a shift to a permissive temperature induced P05121 mRNA expression . In U2OS cells stably expressing an Q01094 -estrogen receptor chimeric protein that could be activated by tamoxifen , P05121 gene transcription was markedly reduced by tamoxifen even in the presence of cycloheximide . These results all indicate that endogenous E2F can directly repress the P05121 gene . P24855 hypersensitive-site analysis of the P05121 promoter suggested the involvement of conformation changes in chromatin structure of the P05121 promoter . 5' deletion analysis of the P05121 promoter showed that multiple sites were responsible for the E2F negative regulation , some of which were promoter dependent . Interestingly , one of these sites is a p53-binding element . Proinflammatory cytokines downregulate gene expression and activity of constitutive nitric oxide synthase in porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells . We evaluated the effects of cytokines on the catalytic activity and expression of porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cell ( PAEC ) constitutive ( P29474 ) and inducible ( P35228 ) isoforms of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) . Exposure of PAEC to the combination of P01579 , P01375 , and P01584 did not alter P35228 activity in cytosolic and membrane fractions but significantly ( p < 0.01 ) reduced P29474 activity in the membrane fraction , but not in the cytosolic fraction , after a 24-h exposure . The cytokine-induced loss of membrane fraction P29474 activity was associated with significant reductions of P29474 mRNA and protein content ( p < 0.01 for both ) . Treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide , but not the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D prevented cytokine-induced reduction of P29474 mRNA expression . These results suggest that cytokine-induced loss of catalytic activity of P29474 is associated with a reduction in P29474 mRNA and protein mass and that cytokines alter P29474 mRNA stability . Inhibition of protein synthesis prevented reduction of P29474 mRNA by cytokines , suggesting that the mechanism by which cytokines alter P29474 mRNA stability involves protein synthesis . Compensatory increases in Her-2/neu activation in response to P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibition in colon cancer cell lines . BACKGROUND : Tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family have become promising targets for anti-neoplastic drugs , but mechanisms of resistance are incompletely understood . To investigate such pathways , we applied a small-molecule , selective P00533 inhibitor , DB00530 , to three well-characterized colon cancer cell lines and studied the alterations of expression and activation of receptors in the erbB family . METHODS : MTT assays were performed to determine the IC(50)s of GEO , FET , and HCT 116 human colorectal cancer cell lines treated with DB00530 . Plated cells were then exposed to either DB01093 control or 7 microm of DB00530 for treatment durations of 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 28 , and 56 days . Cell lysates were evaluated by Western blotting , evaluating both total and phosphorylated levels of P00533 , Her-2/neu , and erbB-3 . RESULTS : IC(50) values for GEO , FET , and HCT 116 cell lines exposed to DB00530 were 12.0 , 16.0 , and greater than 100 microm , respectively . In all treated cell lines , DB00530 diminished P00533 activation but did not affect total expression compared with controls . In contrast , Her-2/neu activation was increased in all cell lines . These changes in P00533 and Her-2/neu were identified within 24 h but peaked later in the treatment cycle . ErbB-3 expression and activation did not follow a consistent pattern between cell lines . CONCLUSIONS : Inhibition of P00533 led to increased activation of Her-2/neu . This result suggests a possible mechanism by which cells might escape the proapoptotic signals resulting from P00533 blockade . Our findings suggest concurrent inhibition of multiple members of the erbB family may yield stronger apoptotic responses than single receptor blockade alone . Clinical trials in thrombolytic therapy , Part 2 : The open-artery hypothesis and RAPID-1 and RAPID-2 . The open-artery hypothesis as supported by thrombolytic study results is discussed . The open-artery hypothesis states that survival after acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) is maximized by achieving early and sustained patency of the infarct-related artery . However , two large multicenter trials did not detect any difference in mortality between patients given alteplase and patients given streptokinase , despite previous evidence that alteplase led to earlier recanalization of infarct-related arteries . The Global Utilization of DB00086 and Tissue P00747 Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries ( GUSTO-1 ) trial suggested that early and complete patency is essential for short-term survival after AMI . Subsequent observations indicated that an open infarct-related artery at the time of hospital discharge is associated with improved long-term survival . In the DB00015 Angiographic Phase II International Dose-Finding ( RAPID-1 ) trial , complete patency was more frequent in patients who received a double-bolus regimen of reteplase than in patients who received standard-dose alteplase . Similar results were obtained in the DB00015 versus DB00009 Patency Investigation during Myocardial Infarction ( RAPID-2 ) trial , which compared the same double-bolus reteplase regimen with an accelerated regimen of alteplase . In both RAPID studies , mortality was lower and other outcomes were more favorable in reteplase recipients . DB00015 seems more likely to produce normal blood flow soon after AMI than either standard-dose or accelerated alteplase and may be associated with a lower mortality rate . This lends further support to the open-artery hypothesis . A curated database of miRNA mediated feed-forward loops involving MYC as master regulator . BACKGROUND : The MYC transcription factors are known to be involved in the biology of many human cancer types . But little is known about the Myc/microRNAs cooperation in the regulation of genes at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Employing independent databases with experimentally validated data , we identified several mixed microRNA/Transcription Factor Feed-Forward Loops regulated by Myc and characterized completely by experimentally supported regulatory interactions , in human . We then studied the statistical and functional properties of these circuits and discussed in more detail a few interesting examples involving Q01094 , P60484 , P06400 and P15692 . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : We have assembled and characterized a catalogue of human mixed Transcription Factor/microRNA Feed-Forward Loops , having Myc as master regulator and completely defined by experimentally verified regulatory interactions . iSubgraph : integrative genomics for subgroup discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma using graph mining and mixture models . The high tumor heterogeneity makes it very challenging to identify key tumorigenic pathways as therapeutic targets . The integration of multiple omics data is a promising approach to identify driving regulatory networks in patient subgroups . Here , we propose a novel conceptual framework to discover patterns of miRNA-gene networks , observed frequently up- or down-regulated in a group of patients and to use such networks for patient stratification in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . We developed an integrative subgraph mining approach , called iSubgraph , and identified altered regulatory networks frequently observed in HCC patients . The miRNA and gene expression profiles were jointly analyzed in a graph structure . We defined a method to transform microarray data into graph representation that encodes miRNA and gene expression levels and the interactions between them as well . The iSubgraph algorithm was capable to detect cooperative regulation of miRNAs and genes even if it occurred only in some patients . Next , the miRNA-mRNA modules were used in an unsupervised class prediction model to discover HCC subgroups via patient clustering by mixture models . The robustness analysis of the mixture model showed that the class predictions are highly stable . Moreover , the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the HCC subgroups identified by the algorithm have different survival characteristics . The pathway analyses of the miRNA-mRNA co-modules identified by the algorithm demonstrate key roles of Myc , Q01094 , let-7 , P01137 , P01375 and P00533 in HCC subgroups . Thus , our method can integrate various omics data derived from different platforms and with different dynamic scales to better define molecular tumor subtypes . iSubgraph is available as MATLAB code at http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ozdemir/isubgraph/ . Endothelin@25 - new agonists , antagonists , inhibitors and emerging research frontiers : IUPHAR Review 12 . Since the discovery of endothelin ( ET ) -1 in 1988 , the main components of the signalling pathway have become established , comprising three structurally similar endogenous 21-amino acid peptides , ET-1 , P20800 and P14138 , that activate two GPCRs , P25101 and ETB . Our aim in this review is to highlight the recent progress in ET research . The ET-like domain peptide , corresponding to prepro-ET-193-166 , has been proposed to be co-synthesized and released with ET-1 , to modulate the actions of the peptide . ET-1 remains the most potent vasoconstrictor in the human cardiovascular system with a particularly long-lasting action . To date , the major therapeutic strategy to block the unwanted actions of ET in disease , principally in pulmonary arterial hypertension , has been to use antagonists that are selective for the P25101 receptor ( ambrisentan ) or that block both receptor subtypes ( DB00559 ) . DB08932 represents the next generation of antagonists , being more potent than DB00559 , with longer receptor occupancy and it is converted to an active metabolite ; properties contributing to greater pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic efficacy . A second strategy is now being more widely tested in clinical trials and uses combined inhibitors of ET-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase such as SLV306 ( daglutril ) . A third strategy based on activating the ETB receptor , has led to the renaissance of the modified peptide agonist IRL1620 as a clinical candidate in delivering anti-tumour drugs and as a pharmacological tool to investigate experimental pathophysiological conditions . Finally , we discuss biased signalling , epigenetic regulation and targeting with monoclonal antibodies as prospective new areas for ET research . DB01197 inhibits neutrophil synthesis of leukotriene B4 in vitro and in vivo . The aim of this investigation was to determine the effects of metalloproteinase inhibitors on leukotriene ( LT ) A4 hydrolase in human neutrophil cytosol and to examine the effects of captopril on intact neutrophils in vitro and in vivo . Cytosolic fractions were assayed for P09960 hydrolase and P09917 activity in the presence or absence of inhibitors . Only bestatin , 1,10-O-phenanthroline , captopril and fosinoprilat demonstrated significant effects . The IC50 of captopril and fosinoprilat for P09960 hydrolase activity were 500 microM and 1 mM , respectively . No inhibition of P09917 activity in cytosolic fractions was detected . The effect of captopril was only minimally reversed by ZnSO4 . The IC50 of captopril for inhibition of LTB4 synthesis in intact neutrophils was 63 microM . Furthermore , 5-HETE production in intact cells was diminished 25.3 +/- 8.5 % in the presence of 1 mM captopril . Oral captopril inhibited stimulated LTB4 release by subsequently isolated neutrophils by 48.1 +/- 5.6 % and 5-HETE release by 43.2 +/- 5.5 % . Thus , captopril is an inhibitor of LTB4 synthesis in neutrophils in vitro and in vivo . However , there are differences between the potency of this drug as assessed in cytosol and intact cell studies . This study significantly extends previous reports in that it demonstrates that captopril is a more potent inhibitor of LTB4 synthesis in intact neutrophils than in cytosol and in that it demonstrates an inhibitory effect of captopril on synthesis of LTB4 by neutrophils exposed to captopril in vivo . Guanylate cyclase C-mediated antinociceptive effects of linaclotide in rodent models of visceral pain . BACKGROUND DB08890 is a novel , orally administered investigational drug currently in clinical development for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-C ) and chronic idiopathic constipation . Visceral hyperalgesia is a major pathophysiological mechanism in IBS-C . Therefore , we investigated the anti-nociceptive properties of linaclotide in rodent models of inflammatory and non-inflammatory visceral pain and determined whether these pharmacological effects are linked to the activation of guanylate cyclase C ( P25092 ) . METHODS Orally administered linaclotide was evaluated in non-inflammatory acute partial restraint stress ( PRS ) and acute water avoidance stress ( P42768 ) models in Wistar rats , and in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( TNBS ) -induced inflammatory model in Wistar rats and P25092 null mice . KEY RESULTS In TNBS-induced colonic allodynia , linaclotide significantly decreased the number of abdominal contractions in response to colorectal distension without affecting the colonic wall elasticity change in response to distending pressures after TNBS . However , linaclotide had no effect on visceral sensitivity under basal conditions . In addition , linaclotide significantly decreased colonic hypersensitivity in the PRS and P42768 models . In wild type ( wt ) and P25092 null mice , the instillation of TNBS induced similar hyperalgesia and allodynia . However , in post-inflammatory conditions linaclotide significantly reduced hypersensitivity only in wt mice , but not in P25092 null mice . CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES These findings indicate that linaclotide has potent anti-nociceptive effects in several mechanistically different rodent models of visceral hypersensitivity and that these pharmacological properties of linaclotide are exerted through the activation of the P25092 receptor . Therefore , linaclotide may be capable of decreasing abdominal pain in patients suffering from IBS-C . Dexamethasone reverses adrenalectomy-induced neuronal de-differentiation in midbrain raphe-hippocampus axis . Differentiation leads to specific morphological and biochemical characteristics . We examined whether epigenetic factors ( e.g. , glucocorticoids ) are required to maintain neuronal differentiation in the adult brain . In the midbrain , adrenalectomy ( P10109 ) ( 1-2 wk ) reduced the size of tryptophan hydroxylase ( WH ) -immunoreactive ( IR ) neurons . P10109 rats exposed to short-term ( 24-72-h ) dexamethasone ( ST-DEX ) in the drinking saline ( 10 mg/l ) showed an increase in WH protein , somal area and dendritic size of WH-IR neurons . In the hippocampus , P10109 for 2-3 mo ( long-term ; LT ) reduced Nissl staining , calbindin ( DB09061 ) -IR and P08908 receptor mRNA in the granular cell layer , and the size of the molecular layer and its DB09061 -IR dendrites . Small vimentin ( Vim ) -IR glial cells emerged in the granular layer . ST-DEX after LT- P10109 rapidly induced a recovery of P08908 mRNA , Nissl labeling and DB09061 -IR in the granule cell layer . In the molecular layer , there was an increase in the area and in the number of DB09061 -IR dendrites . Furthermore , the Vim-IR glial cells were enlarged in size and branching . The rate of cell proliferation was studied in these animals . Immunostaining with antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) and use of bromouridine argue against enhanced neurogenesis after ST-DEX in LT- P10109 . We propose that glucocorticoids induce and maintain differentiation of serotonergic and DB09061 -IR neurons in the midbrain-hippocampal axis . A neuronotrophic role for the glial P08908 receptor is suggested . Clinical utility of vilazodone for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder and theoretical implications for future clinical use . BACKGROUND : DB06684 is the latest approved antidepressant available in the United States . Its dual mechanism of action combines the inhibition of serotonin transporters while simultaneously partially agonizing serotonin-1a ( P08908 ) receptors . This combined activity results in serotonin facilitation across the brain 's serotonergic pathways , which has been termed by the authors as that of a serotonin partial agonist and reuptake inhibitor , or SPARI . OBJECTIVE : The authors to review laboratory , animal model data , and human trial data to synthesize a working theory regarding the mechanism of antidepressant action of this agent and regarding its potential for additional indications . METHODS : A MEDLINE and Internet search was conducted and the resultant evidence reviewed . RESULTS : DB06684 has randomized , controlled empirical data which has garnered it an approval for treating major depressive disorder . It combines two well-known pharmacodynamic mechanisms of serotonergic action into a novel agent . Although no head-to-head studies against other antidepressants are published , the efficacy data for vilazodone appears comparable to other known antidepressants , with associated gastrointestinal side effects similar to serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants , but potentially with a lower incidence of sexual side effects and weight gain . DISCUSSION : As a new option for the treatment of major depressive disorder , vilazodone , due to its unique SPARI mechanism of action , may hold promise for patients who can not tolerate or have not responded to previous antidepressant monotherapies . Additionally , its use may extend to the treatment of other mental health conditions similar to those treated by serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors . Thirteen type I loci from HSA4q , HSA6p , HSA7q and HSA12q were comparatively Q5TCZ1 -mapped in four river buffalo and sheep chromosomes . Thirteen goat BAC clones containing coding sequences from HSA7 , HSA12q , HSA4 and HSA6p were fluorescence in situ mapped to river buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis , BBU ) and sheep ( Ovis aries , OAR ) R-banded chromosomes . The following type I loci were mapped : P03999 to BBU8q32 and OAR4q32 , P35523 to BBU8q34 and OAR4q34 , P17936 to BBU8q24 and OAR4q27 , KRT to BBU4q21 and OAR 3q21 , P01579 to BBU4q23 and OAR3q23 , IGF1 to BBU4q31 and OAR3q31 , P30968 to BBU7q32 and OAR6q32 , P55157 to BBU7q21 and OAR6q15 , P35913 to BBU7q36 and OAR6q36 , BF to BBU2p22 and OAR20q22 , P05305 to BBU2p24 and OAR20q24 , P08263 to BBU2p22 and OAR20q22 , OLADRB ( MHC ) to BBU2p22 and OAR20q22 . All mapped loci appeared to be located on homologous chromosomes and chromosome bands in both bovids . Comparison between gene orders in bovid ( BBU and OAR ) and human ( HSA ) chromosomes revealed complex rearrangements , especially between BBU7/OAR6 and HSA4 , as well as between BBU2p/OAR20 and HSA6p . DB08932 : first global approval . DB08932 ( Opsumit® ) is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) with sustained receptor binding properties developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd . In October 2013 , oral macitentan 10 mg once daily received its first global approval in the US , followed closely by Canada , for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . The drug has also received a positive opinion in the EU from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of PAH , and is under regulatory review in several other countries for the same indication . Endothelin ( ET ) -1 influences pathological changes via two ET receptor subtypes ( P25101 and ETB ) , to which it binds with high affinity . ET-1 is implicated in several forms of vascular disease making it a valid target for the treatment of pulmonary vascular diseases such as PAH . Clinical development is underway for other indications , including Eisenmenger syndrome , ischaemic digital ulcers secondary to systemic sclerosis , and glioblastoma . DB08932 was also evaluated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ; however , a phase 2 trial did not meet its primary endpoint and further investigation in this indication was discontinued . DB08932 was developed by modifying the structure of DB00559 in the search for an optimal dual ERA with improved efficacy and tolerability compared with other ERAs . This article summarizes the milestones in the development of macitentan leading to this first approval for PAH . 17 DB00783 -mediated growth inhibition of MDA-MB-468 cells stably transfected with the estrogen receptor : cell cycle effects . P03372 ( ER ) -negative MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells were stably transfected with wild-type human ER and utilized as a model for investigating estrogen- and aryl hydrocarbon ( Ah ) -responsiveness . Treatment of the stably transfected cells with 10 nM 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) resulted in a significant inhibition ( > 60 % ) of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis , which was blocked by 10(-7) M ICI 182 780 . Analysis by flow cytometry indicated that treatment with E2 increased the percentage of cells in G0/ P55008 ( from 68.8 to 89.4 ) and decreased cells in S ( from 18.4 to 3.4 ) and G2/M ( from 12.8 to 7.2 ) phases of the cell cycle . The effects of E2 on the major cyclins , cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors , retinoblastoma protein ( RB ) , Q01094 , and cyclin-dependent kinase activities were also investigated in the stably transfected MDA-MB-468 cells . The results demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effects of 10(-8) M E2 in ER stably transfected MDA-MB-468 cells were associated with modulation of several factors required for cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis , including significant induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip-1 ( > 4-fold increase after 12 h ) and decreased Q01094 and P12004 protein levels . These results show that the growth-inhibitory effects of E2 in the stably transfected cells were due to multiple factors which result in growth arrest in G0/ P55008 and inhibition of DNA synthesis . A mechanism-based model for the population pharmacokinetics of free and bound aflibercept in healthy subjects . AIM : DB08885 ( P15692 - Q8NHU6 ) , a novel anti-angiogenic agent that binds to P15692 , has been investigated for the treatment of cancer . The aim of this study was to develop a mechanism-based pharmacokinetic ( PK ) model for aflibercept to characterize its binding to P15692 and its PK properties in healthy subjects . METHODS : Data from two phase I clinical studies with aflibercept administered as a single intravenous infusion were included in the analysis . Free and bound aflibercept concentration-time data were analysed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach with MONOLIX 3.1 . RESULTS : The best structural model involved two compartments for free aflibercept and one for bound aflibercept , with a Michaelis-Menten type binding of free aflibercept to P15692 from the peripheral compartment . The typical estimated clearances for free and bound aflibercept were 0.88 l day(-1) and 0.14 l day(-1) , respectively . The central volume of distribution of free aflibercept was 4.94 l . The maximum binding capacity was 0.99 mg day(-1) and the concentration of aflibercept corresponding to half of maximum binding capacity was 2.91 µg ml(-1) . Interindividual variability of model parameters was moderate , ranging from 13.6 % ( V(max) ) to 49.8 % ( Q ) . CONCLUSION : The present PK model for aflibercept adequately characterizes the underlying mechanism of disposition of aflibercept and its nonlinear binding to P15692 . DB01197 inhibits the fluorescence development associated with glycation of proteins . Albumin and immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) show increased visible fluorescence in diabetic patients , IgG fluorescence being correlated with the presence of diabetic retinopathy . DB01197 , an angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor , has free radical scavenging ability , attributable to its thiol group . We compared the scavenging effect of captopril ( at doses between 0.5 and 100 microM ) with perindoprilat , enalapril and enalaprilat ( P12821 inhibitors without scavenging ability ) and two thiol-containing compounds , mercaptopropionylglycine ( P29372 ) and DB06151 ( Q9C000 ) ( scavengers with no effect on P12821 ) . Three systems were used to generate visible fluorescence in albumin and IgG ; glycation , exposure to copper/hydrogen peroxide and gamma radiation . All three thiol-containing compounds inhibited fluorescence development in IgG and albumin , when fluorescence was generated by glycation or gamma radiation . Other P12821 inhibitors had no effect with IgG . Enalapril and perindoprilat showed less effect than captopril with albumin ; enalaprilat had no effect . No compound had any effect on fluorescence generation by copper/hydrogen peroxide . DB01197 may have an additional antioxidant effect compared to other P12821 inhibitors . Estrogen upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene expression in fetal pulmonary artery endothelium . NO , produced by endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) , is a key mediator of pulmonary vasodilation during cardiopulmonary transition at birth . The capacity for NO production is maximal at term because pulmonary P29474 expression increases during late gestation . Since fetal estrogen levels rise markedly during late gestation and there is indirect evidence that the hormone enhances nonpulmonary NO production in adults , estrogen may upregulate P29474 in fetal pulmonary artery endothelium . Therefore , we studied the direct effects of estrogen on P29474 expression in ovine fetal pulmonary artery endothelial cells ( PAECs ) . DB00783 caused a 2.5-fold increase in NOS enzymatic activity in PAEC lysates . This effect was evident after 48 hours , and it occurred in response to physiological concentrations of the hormone ( 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L ) . The increase in NOS activity was related to an upregulation in P29474 protein expression , and P29474 mRNA abundance was also enhanced . P03372 antagonism with DB00947 completely inhibited estrogen-mediated P29474 upregulation , indicating that estrogen receptor activation is necessary for this response . In addition , immunocytochemistry revealed that fetal PAECs express estrogen receptor protein . Furthermore , transient transfection assays with a specific estrogen-responsive reporter system have demonstrated that the endothelial estrogen receptor is capable of estrogen-induced transcriptional transactivation . Thus , estrogen upregulates P29474 gene expression in fetal PAECs through the activation of PAEC estrogen receptors . This mechanism may be responsible for pulmonary P29474 upregulation during late gestation , thereby optimizing the capacity for NO-mediated pulmonary vasodilation at birth . Growth factors and their receptors : new targets for prostate cancer therapy . Stimulation of the signal transduction pathway of the epidermal growth-factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase family of receptors in tumor cells enhances cellular proliferation , prevents apoptosis , and promotes tumor-cell mobility , adhesion , and invasion . Therapeutic approaches used to target the P00533 and its signal transduction cascade include ( 1 ) monoclonal antibodies ( eg , cetuximab [ IMC-C225 ] ) directed against the extracellular binding domain of the receptor ; and ( 2 ) trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody binding to the P04626 receptor ; immunotoxin conjugates use an antibody directed against P00533 joined to a cell toxin . All are in clinical trials for a number of cancers , including prostate cancer . Antisense strategies are in preclinical development . Low-molecular-weight inhibitors of the P00533 tyrosine kinase also in clinical development include DB00530 , PD182905 , PKI-166 , DB05424 , and ZD1839 . ZD1839 has shown encouraging results in patients with prostate cancer in phase 1 trials. mn Target-based agents against ErbB receptors and their ligands : a novel approach to cancer treatment . The ErbB receptors and their cognate ligands that belong to the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) family of peptides are involved in the pathogenesis of different types of carcinomas . In fact , the ErbB receptors and the P01133 -like growth factors are frequently expressed in human tumors . These proteins form a complex system that regulates the proliferation and the survival of cancer cells . Therefore , ErbB receptors and their ligands might represent suitable targets for novel therapeutic approaches in human carcinomas . In this regard , different target-based agents that are directed against the ErbB receptors have been developed in the past two decades . One of these compounds , the humanized anti-ErbB-2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has been approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer . The anti- P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) antibody C225 , as well as P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ZD1839 and DB00530 are currently in phase III clinical development . Several other ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in phase I/II studies . These compounds have generally been shown to have an acceptable toxicity profile and promising anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated patients . The mechanisms of action of these compounds , as well as the potential therapeutic strategies to improve their efficacy are discussed in this review with particular regard to the combinations of anti-ErbB agents with cytotoxic drugs , or combinations of different ErbB-targeting agents . DB00559 , an endothelin receptor antagonist , ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis : the role of P01375 -α in the induction of endothelin system genes . OBJECTIVE : Endothelins ( ETs ) are involved in several inflammatory events . The present study investigated the efficacy of DB00559 , a dual P25101 /ETB receptor antagonist , in collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) in mice . TREATMENT : CIA was induced in DBA/1J mice . Arthritic mice were treated with DB00559 ( 100 mg/kg ) once a day , starting from the day when arthritis was clinically detectable . METHODS : CIA progression was assessed by measurements of visual clinical score , paw swelling and hypernociception . Histological changes , neutrophil infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in the joints . Gene expression in the lymph nodes of arthritic mice was evaluated by microarray technology . PreproET-1 mRNA expression in the lymph nodes of mice and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was evaluated by real-time PCR . The differences were evaluated by one-way Q9UNW9 or Student 's t test . RESULTS : Oral treatment with DB00559 markedly ameliorated the clinical aspects of CIA ( visual clinical score , paw swelling and hyperalgesia ) . DB00559 treatment also reduced joint damage , leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels ( IL-1β , TNFα and Q16552 ) in the joint tissues . Changes in gene expression in the lymph nodes of arthritic mice returned to the levels of the control mice after DB00559 treatment . PreproET mRNA expression increased in PBMCs from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients but returned to basal level in PBMCs from patients under anti- P01375 therapy . In-vitro treatment of PBMCs with TNFα upregulated ET system genes . CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that ET receptor antagonists , such as DB00559 , might be useful in controlling RA . Moreover , it seems that ET mediation of arthritis is triggered by TNFα . Drug evaluation : DB06684 -- a combined SSRI and P08908 partial agonist for the treatment of depression . DB06684 is a combined selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) and a 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonist that is being developed by Clinical Data Inc for the treatment of depression . In preclinical studies , vilazodone compared favorably to other antidepressants such as paroxetine and fluoxetine . Orally administered vilazodone inhibited ultrasonic vocalization in the rat after electrical foot shock ( a model of anxiolytic activity ) . Yet , in the forced swimming test model of depression in rats , vilazodone administered intraperitoneally was active at 1 mg/kg but not at 3 or 10 mg/kg . During clinical trials , vilazodone completely abolished O75628 sleep for 8 h and demonstrated antidepressant efficacy that was equal to that of current antidepressant therapeutics . The author concludes that the success of vilazodone as an effective antidepressant agent will depend on whether the drug can produce a more rapid antidepressant effect than other SSRI agents , or if specific genetic markers of patients can be associated with clinical efficacy . Negative pressure accelerated monolayer keratinocyte healing involves Cdc42 mediated cell podia formation . BACKGROUND : Negative-pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) is developed to facilitate wound healing at controlled subatmospheric pressures in modern medicine . Molecular mechanism for this therapy is still undefined . OBJECTIVE : This study highlights the localization and time-course of the cell division control protein 42 ( Cdc42 ) in the cell membrane at ambient pressure ( AP ) and negative pressures of 75mmHg ( NP75 ) , 125mmHg ( NP125 ) and 175mmHg ( NP175 ) . METHODS : The prepared cells were cultured in a negative pressure incubator with the same O2 and CO2 tensions at the four different pressures . The effective time , complete wound closure time , cell volume , cell viability , and the fluorescence of proliferating cell nuclear antigens ( P12004 ) and actins were evaluated in cells at different pressures . Wound-healing process and Cdc42 fluorescence were examined in cells with the knockdown of Cdc42 . Cdc42 pathway proteins in cell membranes were analyzed after incubation at different pressures for 6 and 12h . RESULTS : The cells at NP125 had less wound closure time and obvious cell podia . Similar P12004 fluorescent intensity was observed in cells at different pressures . The Cdc42 , neural P42768 , and actin expression increased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) in plasma membranes of cells at NP125 for 12h . The knockdown of active Cdc42 resulted in the absence of Cdc42 expression at the cell leading edge . CONCLUSIONS : The activation and localization of Cdc42 pathway proteins in the cell membrane are involved in the cell podia formation in keratinocytes at NP125 . NPWT may facilitate cell migration to accelerate wound healing . Role of endothelin in the maintenance of blood pressure in conscious rats with chronic heart failure . Acute effects of the endothelin receptor antagonist Ro 47-0203 ( DB00559 ) . BACKGROUND : Endothelin ( ET ) is a potent vasoconstrictor , and its concentration is increased in patients with heart failure . The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of endothelin in heart failure by use of a rat model . METHODS AND RESULTS : Experiments were performed on rats at 1 through 16 weeks after sham operation or coronary artery ligation . Rats with left ventricular end-diastolic pressures > 15 mm Hg were considered to have chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , while the others were considered to have uncomplicated myocardial infarction ( MI ) . There were increased ET-1 concentrations in CHF rats at weeks 1 to 16 ( Sham , 20 +/- 0.5 pg/mL , n = 45 ; CHF , 31 +/- 2 pg/mL , n = 50 ; P < .001 ) and transient increases in P14138 concentrations at week 1 in both the MI and CHF groups . There were no significant increases in big ET-1 concentrations , suggesting an increased conversion of ET-1 from big ET-1 in the CHF group . At weeks 2 through 8 , oral administration of the mixed ( P25101 and ETB ) endothelin receptor antagonist DB00559 significantly decreased mean arterial pressure in conscious CHF rats , an effect that increased over time . Furthermore , DB00559 had an additive effect to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril . CONCLUSIONS : Endothelin plays a role in the maintenance of blood pressure in CHF rats , as evidenced by the significant reduction in mean arterial pressure after oral administration of DB00559 . Therefore , endothelin antagonists may be useful therapeutic agents in the treatment of CHF . DB00104 and the novel multireceptor ligand somatostatin receptor agonist pasireotide ( DB06663 ) block the adrenalectomy-induced increase in mitotic activity in male rat anterior pituitary . The novel somatostatin receptor agonist pasireotide binds with high affinity to somatostatin receptors P30872 , 2 , 3 , and 5 . Acting principally through the latter , it inhibits basal and P06850 -stimulated DB01285 secretion from the AtT20 corticotroph cell line and DB01285 release from a proportion of human corticotroph adenomas both in vitro and in vivo . Data supporting an additional antiproliferative effect has led to pasireotide being explored as a potential therapy for patients with Cushing 's disease . We have compared the effects of pasireotide and octreotide on adrenalectomy-induced mitotic and apoptotic activity in the male rat anterior pituitary . Adrenalectomized rats were treated with daily sc injections of vehicle , pasireotide , or octreotide . Changes in proliferation and apoptosis were determined 2-6 d postoperatively . DB06663 and octreotide had no effect on baseline pituitary cell turnover and no measurable effects on apoptosis . However , the wave of increased mitotic activity normally seen in the pituitary after adrenalectomy was completely abolished . Nevertheless , pasireotide and octreotide did not diminish the increase in DB01285 -immunopositive cell index after adrenalectomy , indicating that cell division and differentiation of hormonally null cells in the pituitary are under independent control . In conclusion , basal cell turnover in the pituitary is not inhibited by pasireotide or octreotide . Bilateral adrenalectomy stimulates differentiation of preexisting null cells into DB01285 -positive cells . Cell division after bilateral adrenalectomy occurs in a specific subpopulation of hormonally null cells that are equally sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of pasireotide and octreotide , implicating P30874 receptors in this antimitotic response . DB08932 slows down the dermal fibrotic process in systemic sclerosis : in vitro findings . Systemic sclerosis ( or scleroderma ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by skin and internal organ fibrosis , caused by microvascular dysfunction . The microvascular damage seems to be a consequence of an endothelial autoimmune response , followed by activation of the inflammatory cascade and massive deposition of collagen . P05305 ( ET-1 ) contributes to the inflammatory and fibrotic processes by increasing the concentration of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines , and it is considered one of the most relevant mediators of vascular damage in scleroderma . It is indeed found in very high concentration in serum of sclerodermic patients . Moreover , in these pathological conditions there is an increased expression of ET-1 receptors ( P25101 and ETB ) , which mediate the detrimental action of ET-1 , and often a change of P25101 /ETB ratio . The aim of the present study is to evaluate the in vitro effect of macitentan , an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist , and its major metabolite ( ACT-132577 ) on alpha smooth muscle actin ( alphaSMA ) expression , evaluated on dermal fibroblasts from healthy subjects and on dermal fibroblasts from lesional and non-lesional skin from sclerodermic patients . The combination of macitentan and its major metabolite reduced the levels of & #945;SMA after 48 h in sclerodermic fibroblasts from lesional skin . No relevant changes in & #945;SMA levels were found in fibroblasts from non-lesional skin , whose behavior is similar to that of dermal fibroblasts from healthy patients . Regulation and therapeutic targeting of peptide-activated receptor guanylyl cyclases . Cyclic GMP is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates a wide array of physiologic processes such as blood pressure , long bone growth , intestinal fluid secretion , phototransduction and lipolysis . Soluble and single-membrane-spanning enzymes called guanylyl cyclases ( GC ) synthesize cGMP . In humans , the latter group consists of P16066 , P20594 , P25092 , GC-E and P51841 , which are also known as P16066 , P20594 , StaR , Ret1-GC and Ret2-GC , respectively . Membrane GCs are activated by peptide ligands such as atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , B-type natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) , P23582 ( P09543 ) , guanylin , uroguanylin , heat stable enterotoxin and GC-activating proteins . DB04899 and carperitide are clinically approved peptide-based drugs that activate P16066 . CD-NP is an experimental heart failure drug that primarily activates P20594 but also activates P16066 at high concentrations and is resistant to degradation . Inactivating mutations in P20594 cause acromesomelic dysplasia type Maroteaux dwarfism and chromosomal mutations that increase P09543 concentrations are associated with Marfanoid-like skeletal overgrowth . Pump-based P09543 infusions increase skeletal growth in a mouse model of the most common type of human dwarfism , which supports P09543 / P20594 -based therapies for short stature diseases . DB08890 is a peptide activator of P25092 that stimulates intestinal motility and is in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of chronic constipation . This review discusses the discovery of cGMP , guanylyl cyclases , the general characteristics and therapeutic applications of P16066 , P20594 and P25092 , and emphasizes the regulation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases by phosphorylation and DB00171 . P05121 plays a protective role in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice : role of hepatocyte division . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) is an acute phase protein that has been shown to play a role in experimental fibrosis caused by bile duct ligation ( BDL ) in mice . However , its role in more severe models of hepatic fibrosis ( e.g. , carbon tetrachloride ; CCl(4) ) has not been determined and is important for extrapolation to human disease . Wild-type or P05121 knockout mice were administered CCl(4) ( 1 ml/kg body wt ip ) 2x/wk for 4 wk . Plasma ( e.g. , transaminase activity ) and histological ( e.g. , Sirius red staining ) indexes of liver damage and fibrosis were evaluated . Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by P12004 and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling ( TUNEL ) staining , respectively , as well as by indexes of cell cycle ( e.g. , p53 , cyclin D1 ) . In contrast to previous studies with BDL , hepatic fibrosis was enhanced in P05121 (-/-) mice after chronic CCl(4) administration . Indeed , all indexes of liver damage were elevated in P05121 (-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice . This enhanced liver damage correlated with impaired hepatocyte proliferation . A similar effect on proliferation was observed after one bolus dose of CCl(4) , without concomitant increases in liver damage . Under these conditions , a decrease in phospho-p38 , coupled with elevated p53 protein , was observed ; these results suggest impaired proliferation and a potential G(1)/S cell cycle arrest in P05121 (-/-) mice . These data suggest that P05121 may play multiple roles in chronic liver diseases , both protective and damaging , the latter mediated by its influence on inflammation and fibrosis and the former via helping maintain hepatocyte division after an injury . Successful thrombolysis of a stroke with a pulmonary embolism in a young woman . BACKGROUND : Paradoxical embolism is a rare event , accounting for < 2 % of all arterial emboli . The diagnosis is often difficult , and consequences for the patient can be severe . CASE REPORT : We describe the case of a 35-year-old female physician who presented to our Emergency Department ( ED ) in severe hemodynamic compromise , with an altered level of consciousness and major expressive aphasia 1 day after undergoing a leg varicosal stripping procedure under regional anesthesia . She was successfully thrombolyzed with 0.9 mg/kg of Recombinant Tissue P00747 Activator ( rtPA , DB00009 ) and had a full recovery . CONCLUSION : To our knowledge , this is the first description of a case of massive pulmonary embolism associated with a paradoxical stroke related to patent foramen ovale that was thrombolyzed for both conditions with a " neurological dose " of rtPA . Although thrombolysis was completely successful in this case , indications and contraindications should be thoroughly respected . A more conservative approach with anticoagulation , or a more aggressive approach with surgical thrombectomy , can each potentially have a place in particular cases . Intra-arterial catheter-directed thrombolysis and percutaneous embolectomy are additional options to be considered when available , especially if there are contraindications for systemic thrombolysis . Pharmacologic characterization of endothelin receptor responses in the isolated perfused rat lung . Endothelin receptor subtypes were characterized in isolated perfused rat lungs using the peptide P25101 -receptor antagonists BQ 610 and BQ 123 , the nonpeptide mixed P25101 -/ETB-receptor antagonist DB00559 , and the ETB-receptor agonist IRL 1620 . Intra-arterial injection of 1 nmol IRL 1620 caused an enhanced reduction in pulmonary conductance compared with 1 nmol endothelin ( ET-1 ) or 0.33 nmol IRL 1620 . Pretreatment of lungs with BQ 610 , BQ 123 , or DB00559 aggravated the bronchoconstriction induced by 1 nmol ET-1 so that it was comparable to that induced by 1 nmol IRL 1620 . Although perfusion with 1 nmol IRL 1620 had only minor effects on vascular conductance , 1 nmol ET-1 caused a marked decrease in this parameter . This vasonconstriction was prevented by BQ 610 , BQ 123 , or DB00559 . High concentrations of the stable prostacyclin metabolite , 6-keto-PGF1 alpha , were found in the perfusate of lungs treated with 1 nmol IRL 1620 or 1 nmol ET-1 . The ET-1-induced release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was blocked by DB00559 , but not by BQ 610 . ET-1 , but not IRL 1620 , provoked the release of thromboxane B2 . The main effect of P25101 -receptor stimulation is vasoconstriction , whereas ETB-receptor stimulation causes bronchoconstriction . Both actions , however , are attenuated by the other receptor , i.e. , the P25101 -induced vasoconstriction is attenuated by ETB-receptor-induced release of vasodilators such as prostacyclin , whereas the ETB-receptor-induced bronchoconstriction is attenuated by an unknown P25101 -receptor-dependent bronchodilatory mechanism . Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in the postnatal rat results in decreased cell proliferation in the renal outer medulla . 1. Chronic angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibition or AT1 antagonism during postnatal development in the rat has been shown to cause renal tubular and vascular damage , particularly in the outer medulla . 2 . The effects of P12821 inhibition were investigated at a stage of development before the renal outer medulla is fully established . 3 . Sprague-Dawley rat pups were given daily i.p. injections of either enalapril or saline from days 3-10 . At day 11 , kidneys were perfusion-fixed for either electron microscopy or immunocytochemistry . Sections were incubated in proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) antisera and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was used to detect an immunoreactive product , indicative of proliferating cells . 4 . Following enalapril treatment , the normal structural arrangement of the outer medulla was disrupted compared with controls . Cell proliferation ( P12004 -positive cells ) in the medullary rays was reduced in enalapril-treated kidneys compared with control kidneys . 5 . Thus , angiotensin II appears to be essential for normal tubular and vascular growth in postnatal renal development in the rat . P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors : application in non-small cell lung cancer . Despite treatment advances over the past decade , long-term survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remains poor , and treatment options available after second-line therapy are limited . Increased understanding of cancer biology has led to the identification of several potential targets for treatment . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) belongs to a family of plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases that controls many important cellular functions , from growth and proliferation to cell death . This receptor is a particularly promising therapeutic target because it often is overexpressed in patients with NSCLC and has been implicated in the pathogenesis as well as the proliferation , invasion , and metastasis of lung cancer and other malignancies . New agents developed to inhibit P00533 function include small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors , monoclonal antibodies to P00533 , and pan- P00533 inhibitors . Completed and ongoing clinical trials have shown that P00533 inhibitors have remarkable efficacy for patients with relapsed NSCLC . Among these , two phase 2 trials have shown that ZD1839 is effective when used as monotherapy . The response rates are comparable with those for docetaxel given in the second-line setting . Another phase 2 trial has shown that DB00530 is effective in the same setting . Data from phase 3 trials indicate that adding an P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor to chemotherapy does not provide an additional survival benefit , as compared with standard chemotherapy alone for first-line treatment of NSCLC . It appears that P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are safe and well tolerated by patients with cancer . Further studies will elucidate how these new agents can best be used for NSCLC and other tumor types . Valproic acid suppresses cervical cancer tumor progression possibly via activating Notch1 signaling and enhances receptor-targeted cancer chemotherapeutic via activating somatostatin receptor type II . PURPOSE : We investigated the effects of the anti-epilepsy drug valproic acid ( DB00313 ) alone and in combination in treating cervical cancer . METHODS : DB00313 was investigated for its effects on cervical cancer Hela cell proliferation and tumor growth via in vitro and in vivo assays . RESULTS : DB00313 induce cell growth suppression and cell cycle arrest , with an increase of Notch1 that acts as a tumor suppressor and the change of other tumor-associated genes such as P38936 , p63 and P12004 . DB00313 was also found to induce cell morphological change , with an increase of certain cell transformation markers such as snail1 , snail2 and P19022 . Moreover , DB00313 could significantly up-regulate somatostatin receptor type II ( P30874 ) . Our in vivo study further demonstrated that DB00313 via inducing P30874 up-regulation extremely enhanced the anti-tumor ability of the P30874 -preferential cytotoxic COL- P61278 conjugate in xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : DB00313 could not only suppress tumor progression but also provide a novel promising therapeutic choice in combination with a receptor-targeted cytotoxic conjugate via activating the specific receptor . Somatostatin analogues inhibit cancer cell proliferation in an P30874 -dependent manner via both cytostatic and cytotoxic pathways . Somatostatin receptors ( SSTRs ) are inhibitory G-protein coupled receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in normal and cancer cells . Somatostatins ( P61278 ) are the natural ligands for SSTRs and act as inhibitory regulators of hormone secretion and proliferation . DB00104 and RC-160 ( vapreotide ) are two well tolerated P30874 / P35346 selective somatostatin analogues ( SSA ) that have been used in the treatment of cancers with mixed outcomes . Loss-of-expression of P30874 in tumor tissues has been suggested to correlate to tumor progressions and to the poor outcomes of somatostatin analogue treatment in certain clinical trials . In this study , exogenous human P30874 was overexpressed in two cancer cell lines , capan-2 cells and A549 cells , which had different profiles of endogenous SSTR expression . It was shown that overexpression of P30874 dramatically inhibited the proliferation of P30874 -positive and P30874 -negative cancer cells . Further growth inhibition of these cancer cells overexpressing P30874 was observed by application of octreotide/RC-160 in a dose-dependent fashion . In addition , immunoassay demonstrated that SSA/ P30874 inhibited proliferation via both cell cycle arresting and promoting apoptosis . The results suggested that P30874 could be a promising candidate for gene therapy for P30874 -positive and P30874 -negative tumors . The cellular level of P30874 might be a critical factor that could affect both tumor progression and the outcomes of somatostatin analogue treatment . Down-regulated P13569 During Aging Contributes to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia . Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) is a hyper-proliferative disease of the aging prostate ; however , the exact mechanism underlying the development of BPH remains incompletely understood . The present study investigated the possible involvement of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) , which has been previously shown to negatively regulate nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) /cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) /prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) pathway , in the pathogenesis of BPH . Our results showed decreasing P13569 and increasing P35354 expression in rat prostate tissues with aging . Furthermore , suppression of P13569 led to increased expression of P35354 and over-production of DB00917 in a normal human prostate epithelial cell line ( PNT1A ) with elevated NF-κB activity . DB00917 stimulated the proliferation of primary rat prostate stromal cells but not epithelial cells , with increased P12004 expression . In addition , the condition medium from PNT1A cells after inhibition or knockdown of P13569 promoted cell proliferation of prostate stromal cells which could be reversed by P35354 or NF-κB inhibitor . More importantly , the involvement of P13569 in BPH was further demonstrated by the down-regulation of P13569 and up-regulation of P35354 /NF-κB in human BPH samples . The present results suggest that P13569 may be involved in regulating DB00917 production through its negative regulation on NF-κB/ P35354 pathway in prostate epithelial cells , which consequently stimulates cell growth of prostate stromal cells . The overstimulation of prostate stromal cell proliferation by down-regulation of P13569 -enhanced DB00917 production and release during aging may contribute to the development of BPH . A multi-layer inference approach to reconstruct condition-specific genes and their regulation . An important topic in systems biology is the reverse engineering of regulatory mechanisms through reconstruction of context-dependent gene networks . A major challenge is to identify the genes and the regulations specific to a condition or phenotype , given that regulatory processes are highly connected such that a specific response is typically accompanied by numerous collateral effects . In this study , we design a multi-layer approach that is able to reconstruct condition-specific genes and their regulation through an integrative analysis of large-scale information of gene expression , protein interaction and transcriptional regulation ( transcription factor-target gene relationships ) . We establish the accuracy of our methodology against synthetic datasets , as well as a yeast dataset . We then extend the framework to the application of higher eukaryotic systems , including human breast cancer and Arabidopsis thaliana cold acclimation . Our study identified P09758 ( P09758 ) as a target gene for human breast cancer and discovered its regulation by transcription factors CREB , as well as NFkB . We also predict Q99661 is a target gene for ER-/ P04626 - breast cancer and is positively regulated by Q01094 . The predictions were further confirmed through experimental studies . AVAILABILITY : The implementation and detailed protocol of the layer approach is available at http://www.egr.msu.edu/changroup/Protocols/Three-layer % 20approach % 20 to % 20reconstruct % 20condition.html . Does a nonclassical signaling mechanism underlie an increase of estradiol-mediated gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor binding in ovine pituitary cells ? DB00783 ( E2 ) is the major regulator of P30968 ( GnRHR ) gene expression and number during the periovulatory period ; however , the mechanisms underlying E2 regulation of the P30968 gene remain undefined . Herein , we find that E2 conjugated to BSA ( E2-BSA ) mimics the stimulatory effect of E2 on DB00644 binding in primary cultures of ovine pituitary cells . The time course for maximal DB00644 analog binding was similar for both E2 and E2-BSA . The ability of E2 and E2-BSA to increase DB00644 analog binding was blocked by the estrogen receptor ( ER ) antagonist DB00947 . Also , increased DB00644 analog binding in response to E2 and the selective P03372 agonist propylpyrazole triol was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative form of P03372 ( L540Q ) . Thus , membrane-associated P03372 is the likely candidate for mediating E2 activation of the P30968 gene . As DB02527 response element binding protein ( CREB ) is an established target for E2 activation in gonadotrophs , we next explored a potential role for this protein as an intracellular mediator of the E2 signal . Consistent with this possibility , adenoviral-mediated expression of a dominant-negative form of CREB ( A-CREB ) completely abolished the ability of E2 to increase DB00644 analog binding in primary cultures of ovine pituitary cells . Finally , the presence of membrane-associated E2 binding sites on ovine pituitary cells was demonstrated using a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate of E2-BSA . We suggest that E2 regulation of GnRHR number during the preovulatory period reflects a membrane site of action and may proceed through a nonclassical signaling mechanism , specifically a CREB-dependent pathway . P12821 inhibition suppresses plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression in the neointima of balloon-injured rat aorta . BACKGROUND : P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , an important regulator of fibrinolysis and extracellular matrix turnover , has been implicated in a number of vascular diseases . Studies demonstrating angiotensin II ( Ang II ) to be a potent stimulator of P05121 expression in cultured vascular cells suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may modulate vascular P05121 expression . METHODS AND RESULTS : We examined the effects of the P12821 inhibitor captopril on P05121 expression in control and balloon-injured rat aorta . Northern blot analysis demonstrated that aortic P05121 mRNA expression was 7.6-fold elevated 3 hours ( P < .05 ) after balloon injury , back to baseline at 2 days , increased again at 4 days , and by 7 days after balloon injury was 3.2-fold elevated ( P < .05 ) when compared with control . In captopril-treated rats , the induction of P05121 expression by balloon injury was significantly suppressed by 44 % ( P < .05 ) in the 7 day group but was not altered in the 3-hour group . DB01197 also reduced baseline aortic P05121 mRNA . In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed dense P05121 staining of 7-day neointima in untreated rats and a dramatic decrease in P05121 in neointima of captopril-treated rats . CONCLUSIONS : This report demonstrates that balloon injury results in both a rapid P12821 inhibitor-independent induction of aortic P05121 expression and a later increase in P05121 in the neointima that is significantly suppressed by captopril . This provides the first evidence that the renin-angiotensin system regulates neointimal P05121 expression and that P12821 inhibitors can reduce P05121 in the vessel wall in vivo . DB08890 - a secretagogue and antihyperalgesic agent - what next ? Ongoing clinical trials suggest that linaclotide , a first-in-class , 14-amino acid peptide guanylate cyclase-C ( P25092 ) receptor agonist and intestinal secretagogue is an effective treatment for chronic constipation . A study in this issue of the Journal suggests that linaclotide also has antihyperalgesic effects in three common rat models of inflammation- and stress-induced hypersensitivity ( i.e. , acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid colitis , water avoidance stress [ P42768 ] , and restraint-induced stress ) but not in naïve animals . In mice , linaclotide at least partly reduces hyperalgesia via P25092 receptors . Dose-effect relationships of linaclotide were complicated and non-linear . This viewpoint discusses human clinical trials with linaclotide and the results of this study . Potential mechanisms and clinical significance of these findings are explored . Collectively , these data suggest that P25092 receptors exert other , as yet poorly understood , effects on gastrointestinal sensitivity in conditions associated with inflammation and/or stress-induced increased intestinal permeability . However , the data need to be confirmed in humans and in long-term animal models . Further studies are also necessary to elucidate the mechanisms as these effects can not be explained by linaclotide 's known effects on epithelial P25092 receptors . Chemopreventive efficacy and mechanism of licofelone in a mouse lung tumor model via aspiration . Our previous study comparing inhalation and aspiration to administer agents directly to lung indicated that aspiration route is as effective as inhalation while reducing costs for equipment and chemopreventive agent . This study evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy and mechanism of licofelone , a dual inhibitor of P35354 and P09917 ( 5-Lox ) , via oropharyngeal aspiration against mouse lung adenoma . Eight-week-old female A/J mice were given three doses of benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ; 2 mg/dose , gavage ) to induce lung adenomas . After dysplasia developed , the mice were given licofelone ( 0 , 0.03 , 0.1 , or 0.3 mg/kg ) for 16 weeks , and tumor incidence and multiplicity in lung were measured . In addition , the expression of a series of biomarkers in lung cancer progression was evaluated at 2 and 16 weeks . DB04725 showed dose-related inhibition of B[a]P-induced tumor incidence and multiplicity at 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg following 16-week treatment . DB04725 also showed dose-dependent inhibition of P35354 ( 25 % -41 % ) and 5-Lox ( 35 % -61 % ) at 2 and 16 weeks and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ; 41 % -61 % ) at 16 weeks . A dose-dependent increase in apoptosis ( 1.5- to 2.4-fold ) was also observed in licofelone groups . A marginal inhibition of survivin was observed at one dose . In conclusion , this study showed that licofelone via aspiration showed chemopreventive efficacy against mouse lung adenoma with good correlation to early and late biomarkers of lung cancer progression . This is the first study to show that the aspiration route can be an excellent inexpensive alternative to inhalation for direct delivery of drugs to rodent lungs for efficacy testing of potential chemopreventive agents . Albumin caused the increasing production of angiotensin II due to the dysregulation of P12821 / Q9BYF1 expression in P52789 cells . BACKGROUND : Previous studies have proposed that albuminuria is involved in the activation of intrarenal renin angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) , while its potential mechanism is still unclear . We investigated the influence of albumin on the expression of P12821 / Q9BYF1 and generation of Ang II in P52789 cells . METHODS : The mRNA and protein expression of P12821 and Q9BYF1 was determined by RT-PCR and western blot respectively . Cellular localization of P12821 and Q9BYF1 was shown by laser scanning confocal microscope ( LSCM ) . The concentration of Ang II in the supernatant was detected by radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) . RESULTS : Treatment of HK-2 cells to BSA led to a significant increasing expression of P12821 mRNA in dose and time dependent manner . The overexpression of P12821 protein induced by BSA was consistent with its mRNA expression . Meanwhile , the mRNA and protein expression of Q9BYF1 upon the stimulation of BSA was significantly downregulated in dose and time dependent manner . BSA could significantly increase the production of Ang II in the supernatant ( p < 0.05 ) . DB01197 , however , attenuated the expression of P12821 but increased expression of Q9BYF1 induced by BSA . CONCLUSION : These findings suggested a novel insight on the albuminuria induced activation of intrarenal DB01367 by upregulation of P12821 and downregulation of Q9BYF1 . A review of vilazodone , serotonin , and major depressive disorder . OBJECTIVE : To review the mechanism of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) -mediated serotonergic neurotransmission , focusing on serotonin 1A ( P08908 ) autoreceptors , which are proposed to be involved in delaying therapeutic efficacy . DB06684 was specifically designed to function both as an SSRI and a partial agonist at P08908 receptors . This combined mechanism is proposed to decrease time to efficacy , minimize sexual side effects , and provide concomitant anxiolytic properties . DATA SOURCES : A PubMed search of all English-language articles from January 1990 to January 2013 was conducted using the search terms depression and 5-HT 1A , depression and buspirone , depression and pindolol , and vilazodone . STUDY SELECTION : We found 47 articles and abstracts that were selected for inclusion on the basis of information about the pharmacology of P08908 receptors and the clinical data on pindolol , buspirone , and vilazodone in depression . DATA EXTRACTION : This review summarizes current literature involving antidepressant activity , the role of P08908 autoreceptors , and clinical trials involving serotonin reuptake inhibition in conjunction with P08908 agonists and partial agonists , with a focus on vilazodone . RESULTS : DB06684 has demonstrated efficacy in 2 large , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trials in major depressive disorder . RESULTS suggest that vilazodone has a low incidence of sexual side effects and is effective in patients with high levels of anxiety . A pooled analysis shows evidence of significant symptom reduction after only 1 week of therapy . CONCLUSIONS : If future studies corroborate the clinical benefits attributed to its mechanism of action , vilazodone may show potential advantages in terms of onset of action , sexual side effects , and anxiolytic activity in patients with major depressive disorder . DB08885 for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration . BACKGROUND : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) affects > 14 million individuals worldwide . Although 90 % of patients with AMD have the dry form , neovascular AMD accounts for the vast majority of patients who develop legal blindness . Until recently , few treatment options existed for treatment of neovascular AMD . The advent of anti- P15692 therapy has significantly improved the safe and effective treatment of neovascular AMD . In addition to two anti- P15692 drugs currently in widespread use , ranibizumab and bevacizumab , a number of medications that interrupt angiogenesis are currently under investigation . One promising new drug is aflibercept ( DB08885 ) , a fusion protein that blocks all isoforms of P15692 and placental growth factors-1 and -2 . OBJECTIVE : To review the current literature and clinical trial data regarding DB08885 for the treatment of neovascular AMD . METHODS : Literature review . RESULTS/CONCLUSION : DB08885 is a novel anti- P15692 therapy , with Phase I and II trial data indicating safety , tolerability and efficacy for the treatment of neovascular AMD . Two Phase III clinical trials ( VIEW-1 and VIEW-2 ) comparing DB08885 to ranibizumab are currently continuing and will provide vital insight into the clinical applicability of this drug . DB08890 -a novel secretagogue in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation . Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation ( IBS-C ) and chronic idiopathic constipation ( Q96RK0 ) are highly prevalent gastrointestinal disorders . Traditional symptoms based therapies had somewhat limited success and efficacy in addressing the disorders . Recently , linaclotide emerged as novel peptide capable of improving abdominal symptoms in patients suffering from IBS-C and Q96RK0 . Guanylate cyclase C ( P25092 ) receptor a multi domain protein , found to be molecular target for linaclotide which acts by activating P25092 receptor on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells . Binding of linaclotide to P25092 receptor triggers the elevation of second messenger cGMP that elicits fluid secretion into intestinal cells which play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis through cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) . Data from Phase II and III clinical trials demonstrated that linaclotide seems to produce a statistically significant increase in stool frequency , improved straining , decreased abdominal pain and discomfort . Fermented soshiho-tang with Lactobacillus plantarum enhances the antiproliferative activity in vascular smooth muscle cell . BACKGROUND : Soshiho-tang ( P61278 ) is a traditional medicine widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis . P61278 has been shown to confer a variety of pharmacological activities , including prevention of hepatotoxicity , promotion of liver regeneration , and modulation of liver fibrosis . In this study , we investigated the antiproliferative activity of native and fermented ( FSST ) formulations of P61278 in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) and examined the potential underlying mechanisms driving these effects . METHODS : P61278 , along with preparations fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum KFRI-144 ( S-A144 ) , L. amylophilus KFRI-161 ( S-A161 ) and L. bulgaricus KFRI-344 ( S-A344 ) , were investigated to determine their effects on the proliferation and viability of VSMCs , along with the signalling pathways underlying these effects . RESULTS : S-A144 exhibited a strong , dose-dependent inhibition of VSMC proliferation relative to untreated controls , but the others did not affect . In addition , S-A144 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and PLCγ1 in a dose-dependent manner and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/ P55008 phase characterised by decreased expression of CDKs , cyclins and P12004 . CONCLUSIONS : The findings suggest that S-A144 exhibit enhanced inhibition of DB00102 -induced VSMC proliferation comparison to S-AOR through the suppression of cell cycle progression and expression of cell cycle-related proteins , along with the downregulation of Akt phosphorylation .
Dual ligands targeting dopamine D2 and serotonin P08908 receptors as new antipsychotical or anti-Parkinsonian agents . Psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson 's disease are associated with poly-factorial pathogenic mechanisms , with several neurotransmitter systems closely involved . In addition to the cerebral dopaminergic ( DA ) system , the serotoninergic ( 5-HT ) system also plays a crucial role in regulating psychoemotional , cognitive and motor functions in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Among the large 5-HT receptor family , accumulating data have revealed new insights into the therapeutic benefit of the P08908 receptor in treating various CNS disorders , especially schizophrenia and Parkinson 's disease . The present review discusses the advance of dual agents with mixed actions at the dopamine D2 and serotonin P08908 receptors in the treatment of these diseases . Aripiprazole was the only marketed drug with dual D2 and P08908 profile . It is a partial D2 and P08908 receptor agonist and has been prescribed as an atypical antipsychotical drug . Two other drugs DB06016 and Pardoprunox are being investigated in clinic . Most of the other candidate compounds , including DB04888 , Sarizotan , Mazapertine succinate , PF-217830 , and Adoprazine were discontinued due to either non-optimal pharmacokinetic properties or insufficient therapeutical efficacy . Although much effort has been done to highlight the advantages of the P08908 and D2 dual approach , it has to be pointed out that many of these drugs showed poly-pharmacological profile by targeting many other receptors and/or transporters besides the D2 and P08908 receptors . In this regard , ' pure ' compounds exclusively acting on the D2 and P08908 receptors are highly needed to further validate this approach . Meanwhile , safety concerns and in vivo pharmacokinetic alerts should also be implanted to the drug design art early . Thyroid hormone status interferes with estrogen target gene expression in breast cancer samples in menopausal women . We investigated thyroid hormone levels in menopausal BrC patients and verified the action of triiodothyronine on genes regulated by estrogen and by triiodothyronine itself in BrC tissues . We selected 15 postmenopausal BrC patients and a control group of 18 postmenopausal women without BrC . We measured serum P07202 -AB , DB00024 , FT4 , and estradiol , before and after surgery , and used immunohistochemistry to examine estrogen and progesterone receptors . BrC primary tissue cultures received the following treatments : ethanol , triiodothyronine , triiodothyronine plus 4-hydroxytamoxifen , 4-hydroxytamoxifen , estrogen , or estrogen plus 4-hydroxytamoxifen . Genes regulated by estrogen ( P01135 , P01137 , and P06401 ) and by triiodothyronine ( Q07011 , P22004 , and P10827 ) in vitro were evaluated . DB00024 levels in BrC patients did not differ from those of the control group ( 1.34 ± 0.60 versus 2.41 ± 1.10 μ U/mL ) , but FT4 levels of BrC patients were statistically higher than controls ( 1.78 ± 0.20 versus 0.95 ± 0.16 ng/dL ) . P01135 was upregulated and downregulated after estrogen and triiodothyronine treatment , respectively . DB00279 increased P06401 expression ; however 4-hydroxytamoxifen did not block triiodothyronine action on P06401 expression . DB04468 , alone or associated with triiodothyronine , modulated gene expression of Q07011 , P22004 , and P10827 , similar to triiodothyronine treatment . Thus , our work highlights the importance of thyroid hormone status evaluation and its ability to interfere with estrogen target gene expression in BrC samples in menopausal women . Cordycepin suppresses P01375 -α-induced NF-κB activation by reducing p65 transcriptional activity , inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation , and blocking IKKγ ubiquitination . Cordycepin is reported to participate in multiple pharmacological activities including anti-tumor and anti-inflammation , and is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway . However , the detailed molecular mechanism of cordycepin in suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway remains ambiguous . In this study , we first analyzed the effect of cordycepin on NF-κB activity in P29320 -293T cells , and found that cordycepin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in P01375 -α-induced NF-κB activation . Although cordycepin did not block P01375 -α-induced nuclear translocation of p65 , high concentration of cordycepin reduced the DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of NF-κB . Moreover , cordycepin also inhibited IκBα phosphorylation so as to suppress the degradation of IκBα . Further investigation revealed that cordycepin suppressed IKKs-mediated NF-κB activation and inhibited the ubiquitination of IKKγ . In conclusion , cordycepin effectively inhibits NF-κB signaling through suppressing the activities of NF-κB , IκB and IKK . Thus , cordycepin may provide some potential therapeutic application in inflammation-associated disorders and cancer . P01286 as an agonist of the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a . Ghrelin synergizes with growth hormone-releasing hormone ( P01286 ) to potentiate growth hormone ( GH ) response through a mechanism not yet fully characterized . This study was conducted to analyze the role of P01286 as a potential ligand of the ghrelin receptor , GHS-R1a . The results show that hGHRH(1-29)NH(2) ( P01286 ) induces a dose-dependent calcium mobilization in P29320 293 cells stably transfected with GHS-R1a an effect not observed in wild-type P29320 293 cells . This calcium rise is also observed using the Q02643 agonists JI-34 and JI-36 . Radioligand binding and cross-linking studies revealed that calcium response to P01286 is mediated by the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a . P01286 activates the signaling route of inositol phosphate and potentiates the maximal response to ghrelin measured in inositol phosphate turnover . The presence of P01286 increases the binding capacity of (125)I-ghrelin in a dose dependent-fashion showing a positive binding cooperativity . In addition , confocal microscopy in CHO cells transfected with GHS-R1a tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein shows that P01286 activates the GHS-R1a endocytosis . Furthermore , the selective P01286 -R antagonists , JV-1-42 and JMR-132 , act also as antagonists of the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a . Our findings suggest that P01286 interacts with ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a , and , in consequence , modifies the ghrelin-associated intracellular signaling pathway . This interaction may represent a form of regulation , which could play a putative role in the physiology of GH regulation and appetite control . DB00233 inhibits O15111 alpha phosphorylation of P25963 in mouse intestinal epithelial cells . P01375 alpha ( TNFalpha ) -stimulated nuclear factor ( NF ) kappaB activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) . Phosphorylation of NFkappaB inhibitory protein ( IkappaB ) leading to its degradation and NFkappaB activation , is regulated by the multimeric O15111 complex , including IKKalpha and IKKbeta . We recently reported that DB00244 ( DB00244 ) inhibits TNFalpha-regulated IkappaB degradation and NFkappaB activation . To determine the mechanism of DB00244 inhibition of IkappaB degradation , we studied young adult mouse colon ( YAMC ) cells by immunodetection and in vitro kinase assays . We show DB00244 inhibits TNFalpha-stimulated phosphorylation of P25963 in intact YAMC cells . Phosphorylation of a glutathione S-transferase- P25963 fusion protein by cellular extracts or immunoprecipitated IKKalpha isolated from cells treated with TNFalpha is inhibited by DB00244 . Recombinant IKKalpha and IKKbeta autophosphorylation and their phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase- P25963 are inhibited by DB00244 . However , IKKalpha serine phosphorylation by its upstream kinase in either intact cells or cellular extracts is not blocked by DB00244 . Surprisingly , immunodepletion of cellular extracts suggests IKKalpha is predominantly responsible for P25963 phosphorylation in intestinal epithelial cells . In summary , DB00244 inhibits TNFalpha-stimulated IKKalpha kinase activity toward P25963 in intestinal epithelial cells . These findings suggest a novel role for DB00244 in the management of Q9UKU7 by disrupting TNFalpha activation of NFkappaB . DB01645 potentiates the P01160 effect on a K(+)-conductance in P29320 -293 cells . P29320 -293 cells are known to reflect many features of the late distal tubule . Furthermore , they have the ability to release urodilatin , the structural analog to P01160 . RT-PCR was performed to test for the expression of natriuretic peptide receptors . While the mRNA for the human P01160 receptor ( P16066 , P16066 ) could be amplified , the P09543 -specific receptor P20594 ( P20594 ) and the receptor specific for guanylins , P25092 , could not be detected . In patch clamp experiments the effects of P01160 ( 10 nM ) on membrane voltage ( V(m) ) were monitored and P29320 -293 cells depolarized by 2.3 +/- 0.5 mV ( n=14 ) . In the presence of the P01133 receptor blocker genistein ( 10 microM ) the effect of P01160 was increased by 65 % to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mV ( n=14 ) . After removal of genistein the P01160 -mediated depolarization further increased by 147 % to 5.7 +/- 1.0 mV ( n=14 ) . P01160 given repetitively without genistein had no increasing depolarizing effect in P29320 -293 cells with time . The P01160 effect could be fully blocked by 1 mM Ba(2+) and by 1 microM of the specific PKG inhibitor KT5823 indicating that P01160 inhibits a K(+)-conductance via a cGMP-dependent protein kinase . DB01645 itself hyperpolarized the membrane voltage of P29320 -293 cells by -3.9 +/- 0.6 mV ( n=11 ) and this effect could also be fully blocked by Ba(2+) ( -0.3 +/- 0.1 mV , n=5 ) , indicating that genistein activates a K(+)-conductance which contributes significantly to the membrane potential of P29320 -293 cells . DB05692 , a thrombin receptor ( P25116 ) antagonist for the prevention and treatment of atherothrombosis . DB05692 is a novel antiplatelet agent undergoing development by Schering-Plough Corp for the treatment and prevention of atherothrombosis . The compound is an orally administered himbacine analog that potently antagonizes the platelet thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor 1 ( P25116 ) , which leaves the procoagulant function of thrombin intact . In preclinical studies , DB05692 demonstrated no effect on bleed time or coagulation parameters . In both cynomolgus monkeys and humans , the compound had high bioavailability and inhibited ex vivo TRAP ( thrombin receptor-activating peptide ) -stimulated platelet aggregation in a potent and long-lasting manner . In a phase II clinical trial of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention , DB05692 added to standard therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel did not increase major or minor thrombolysis in myocardial infarction bleeding , and demonstrated a trend toward decreased major adverse cardiovascular events versus placebo . At the time of publication , three phase III trials were underway to assess the efficacy and safety of DB05692 for at least 1 year in up to 35,000 patients with acute coronary syndromes or atherosclerosis . The distinct mechanism of action of DB05692 allows for cardiovascular protection without the liability of increased bleeding associated with other antiplatelet therapies . Phase III trials in high-risk patients will determine the use of DB05692 in cardiological practice . The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol potentiates doxorubicin efficacy in advanced sarcomas : preclinical investigations and results of a phase I dose-escalation clinical trial . PURPOSE : Dysregulated cyclin-dependent kinases are important to the growth of some sarcomas . DB03496 is a pan-CDK inhibitor that has been shown to potentiate chemotherapy . As such , we explored the potentiation of doxorubicin by flavopiridol in sarcoma , in vitro and in vivo , and conducted a phase I trial of flavopiridol with doxorubicin in patients with advanced sarcomas . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Sarcoma cell lines and xenografts were treated with flavopiridol alone and in combination with doxorubicin . In the phase I study , doxorubicin and flavopiridol were administered on two flavopiridol schedules ; a 1-hour bolus and split dosing as a 30-minute bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion . RESULTS : Preclinically , flavopiridol potentiated doxorubicin . In vivo , doxorubicin administered 1 hour before flavopiridol was more active than doxorubicin alone . Clinically , 31 patients were enrolled on protocol and flavopiridol was escalated to target dose in two schedules ( 90 mg/m(2) bolus ; 50 mg/m(2) bolus + 40 mg/m(2) infusion ) both in combination with doxorubicin ( 60 mg/m(2) ) . Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia , leukopenia , and febrile neutropenia but no maximum tolerated dose was defined . DB03496 pharmacokinetics showed increasing C(max) with increasing dose . Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) responses included two partial responses , however , stable disease was seen in 16 patients . Of 12 evaluable patients with progressive well- and dedifferentiated liposarcoma , eight had stable disease greater than 12 weeks . CONCLUSIONS : The sequential combination of doxorubicin followed by flavopiridol is well tolerated on both schedules . Disease control was observed in well- and dedifferentiated liposarcoma specifically , a disease in which P11802 is known to be amplified . Rat peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and brown adipose tissue function during cold acclimatization . Brown adipose tissue ( Q14032 ) hyperplasia is a fundamental physiological response to cold ; it involves an acute phase of mitotic cell growth followed by a prolonged differentiation phase . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) are key regulators of fatty acid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation and may therefore mediate important metabolic changes during non-shivering thermogenesis . In the present study we have investigated Q07869 mRNA expression in relation to peroxisome proliferation in rat Q14032 during cold acclimatization . By immunoelectron microscopy we show that the number of peroxisomes per cytoplasmic volume and acyl- DB01992 oxidase immunolabeling density remained constant ( thus increasing in parallel with tissue mass and cell number ) during the initial proliferative phase and the acute thermogenic response but increased after 14 days of cold exposure , correlating with terminal differentiation of Q14032 . A pronounced decrease in Q14032 PPARalpha and PPARgamma mRNA levels was found within hours of exposure to cold , which was reversed after 14 days , suggesting a role for either or both of these subtypes in the proliferation and induction of peroxisomes and peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes . In contrast , PPARdelta mRNA levels increased progressively during cold exposure . Transactivation assays in HIB 1B and P29320 -293 cells demonstrated an adrenergic stimulation of peroxisome proliferator response element reporter activity via Q07869 , establishing a role for these nuclear receptors in hormonal regulation of gene transcription in Q14032 . PEGylation of growth hormone-releasing hormone ( P01286 ) analogues . Synthetically produced GRF1-29 ( DB00010 ) has an amino acid composition identical to the N-terminal 29 amino acids sequence of the natural hypothalamic GHRH1-44 ( Figure 1 ) . It maintains bioactivity in vitro and is almost equally effective in eliciting secretion of endogenous growth hormone in vivo . The main drawbacks associated with the pharmaceutical use of hGRF1-29 relate to its short half-life in plasma , about 10-20 min in humans , which is caused mostly by renal ultrafiltration and enzymatic degradation at the N terminus . PEGylation has been considered as one valid approach to obtain more stable forms of the peptide , with a longer in vivo half-life and ultimately with increased pharmacodynamic response along the somatotropic axis ( endogenous GH , DB01277 levels ) . Different PEGylated P01286 conjugates were obtained and their bioactivity was tested in vitro and in vivo by monitoring endogenous growth hormone ( GH ) serum levels after intravenous ( i.v. ) injection in rats , and intravenous and subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection in pigs . It was found that P01286 -PEG conjugates are able to bind and activate the human Q02643 , although with different potency . The effect of PEG molecular weight , number of PEG chains bound and position of PEGylation site on P01286 activity were investigated . Mono-PEGylated isomers with a PEG5000 polymer chain linked to Lys 12 or Lys 21 residues , showed high biological activity in vitro , which is similar to that of hGRF1-29 , and a higher pharmacodynamic response as compared to unmodified P01286 molecule . Q08462 selectively couples to E prostanoid type 2 receptors , whereas adenylyl cyclase 3 is not receptor-regulated in airway smooth muscle . Adenylyl cyclases ( ACs ) are important regulators of airway smooth muscle function , because β-adrenergic receptor ( βAR ) agonists stimulate AC activity and DB02527 production . We have previously shown in a number of cell types that AC6 selectively couples to βAR and these proteins are coexpressed in lipid rafts . We overexpressed AC2 , O60266 , and AC6 in mouse bronchial smooth muscle cells ( mBSMCs ) and human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) -293 cells by using recombinant adenoviruses and assessed their localization and regulation by various G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . O60266 and AC6 were expressed primarily in caveolin-rich fractions , whereas AC2 expression was excluded from these domains . AC6 expression enhanced DB02527 production in response to isoproterenol but did not increase responses to butaprost , reflecting the colocalization of AC6 with β(2)AR but not E prostanoid type 2 receptor ( EP(2)R ) in lipid raft fractions . AC2 expression enhanced butaprost-stimulated DB02527 production but had no effect on the β(2)AR-mediated response . O60266 did not couple to any GPCR tested . DB02587 -induced arborization of mBSMCs was assessed as a functional readout of DB02527 signaling . Arborization was enhanced by overexpression of AC6 and O60266 , but AC2 had no effect . GPCR-stimulated arborization mirrored the selective coupling observed for DB02527 production . With the addition of the phosphodiesterase 4 ( DB05876 ) inhibitor rolipram AC2 accelerated forskolin-stimulated arborization . Thus , AC2 selectively couples to EP(2)R , but signals from this complex are limited by DB05876 activity . O60266 does not seem to couple to GPCR in either mBSMCs or P29320 -293 cells , so it probably exists in a distinct signaling domain in these cells . Q03135 interacts with 5- Q13049 serotonin receptors and profoundly modulates the signaling of selected Galphaq-coupled protein receptors . 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A ( 5-HT(2A) ) serotonin receptors are important for a variety of functions including vascular smooth muscle contraction , platelet aggregation , and the modulation of perception , cognition , and emotion . In a search for 5-HT(2A) receptor-interacting proteins , we discovered that caveolin-1 ( Cav-1 ) , a scaffolding protein enriched in caveolae , complexes with 5-HT(2A) receptors in a number of cell types including P13671 glioma cells , transfected P29320 -293 cells , and rat brain synaptic membrane preparations . To address the functional significance of this interaction , we performed RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 in P13671 glioma cells , a cell type that endogenously expresses both 5-HT(2A) receptors and Cav-1 . We discovered that the in vitro knockdown of Cav-1 in P13671 glioma cells nearly abolished 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated signal transduction as measured by calcium flux assays . RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 also greatly attenuated endogenous Galpha(q)-coupled P2Y purinergic receptor-mediated signaling without altering the signaling of P25116 thrombin receptors . Cav-1 appeared to modulate 5-HT(2A) signaling by facilitating the interaction of 5-HT(2A) receptors with Galpha(q) . These studies provide compelling evidence for a prominent role of Cav-1 in regulating the functional activity of not only 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptors but also selected Galpha(q)-coupled receptors . Functional characterization of a novel serotonin receptor ( 5-HTap2 ) expressed in the CNS of Aplysia californica . Serotonin has been shown to be a neuromodulator in the Aplysia californica CNS . The diversity of serotonin actions is due to the existence of several different receptor subtypes . In this study we report the cloning of a full-length cDNA , coding for a novel serotonin receptor ( 5-HTap2 ) . The receptor protein bears the characteristics of G protein-coupled receptors . It shares 68 % and 34 % of its amino acid sequence identity with the 5-HTlym receptor from Lymnaea stagnalis and the mammalian P08908 receptor , respectively . When transfected in P29320 293 cells , 5-HTap2 was negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase . Ligand binding analysis indicated that the order of potencies of various drugs for the inhibition of [3H]LSD binding was : methiothepin > metergoline > 5-CT > PAPP > 5-HT > ketanserin > NAN-190 > 8-OH-DPAT > clozapine . RT-PCR amplification of RNA isolated from different tissues indicated that this receptor is expressed in the CNS and in bag cells . The expression of 5-HTap2 restricted to the CNS suggests an important role for this receptor in the modulation of neuronal functions in Aplysia . Moreover , the high expression of 5-HTap2 in the bag cells , associated with its pharmacological profile , suggests that this receptor may be implicated in modulating the afterdischarge during the egg-laying behavior . DuOx2 Promoter Regulation by Hormones , Transcriptional Factors and the Coactivator TAZ . The production of H2O2 , which is essential to thyroid hormone synthesis , involves two NADPH oxidases : dual oxidases 1 and 2 ( DuOx1 and DuOx2 ) . A functional study with human DuOx genes and their 5'-flanking regions showed that DuOx1 and -2 promoters are different from thyroid-specific gene promoters . Furthermore , their transcriptional activities are not restricted to thyroid cells . While regulation of Tg ( thyroglobulin ) and P07202 ( thyroperoxidase ) expression have been extensively studied , DuOx2 promoter regulation by hormones and transcriptional factors need to be more explored . Herein we investigated the role of DB00024 , insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 ( DB01277 ) , as well as the DB02527 effect on DuOx2 promoter ( ptx41 ) activity in transfected rat thyroid cell lines ( PCCL3 ) . We also assessed DuOx2 promoter activity in the presence of transcriptional factors crucial to thyroid development such as Q15669 -1 ( thyroid transcription factor 1 ) , Q06710 , CREB , Q9Y2W7 , Nkx2.5 and the coactivator TAZ in HeLa and P29320 293T-transfected cells . Our results show that DB00024 and forskolin , which increase DB02527 in thyroid cells , stimulated DuOx2 promoter activity . DB01277 led to pronounced stimulation , while insulin induction was not statistically different from DuOx2 promoter basal activity . All transcriptional factors selected for this work and coactivator TAZ , except Q9Y2W7 , stimulated DuOx2 promoter activity . Moreover , Nkx2.5 and TAZ synergistically increased DuOx2 promoter activity . In conclusion , we show that DuOx2 expression is regulated by hormones and transcription factors involved in thyroid organogenesis and carcinogenesis , reinforcing the importance of the control of H2O2 generation in the thyroid . Emerging small molecule drugs . Dyslipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases . Pharmacological lowering of LDL-C levels using statins reduces cardiovascular risk . However , a substantial residual risk persists especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Because of the inverse association observed in epidemiological studies of HDL-C with the risk for cardiovascular diseases , novel therapeutic strategies to raise HDL-C levels or improve HDL functionality are developed as complementary therapy for cardiovascular diseases . However , until now most therapies targeting HDL-C levels failed in clinical trials because of side effects or absence of clinical benefits . This chapter will highlight the emerging small molecules currently developed and tested in clinical trials to pharmacologically modulate HDL-C and functionality including new P11597 inhibitors ( anacetrapib , evacetrapib ) , novel Q07869 agonists ( K-877 , CER-002 , P15924 -8658 , INT131 and DB05187 ) , LXR agonists ( ATI-111 , LXR-623 , XL-652 ) and RVX-208 . The zinc-finger protein Q9P0J7 is overexpressed during pancreatic cancer development and downregulation of Q9P0J7 inhibits pancreatic cancer development in mice . Q9P0J7 1 ( Q9P0J7 ) was found upregulated in a differential screen in the metaplastic epithelium in the pancreas of transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -alpha transgenic mice . Expression analysis indicated broad overexpression in human cancer tissues . Therefore , we investigated the hypothesis that Q9P0J7 promotes metaplastic changes and tumor development . Q9P0J7 represents an evolutionarily highly conserved protein with a 95 % identity between human and zebrafish . Q9P0J7 is expressed during embryonic development and in the majority of adult tissues investigated . Upregulation of nuclear Q9P0J7 expression is evident in preneoplastic lesions and in several epithelial malignancies , such as pancreatic cancer in mice and humans . In cell culture and in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model , Q9P0J7 enhances proliferation , migration and invasion of P29320 -293 and Panc1 cells . In crossbreeding experiments , Q9P0J7 -knockdown gene trap mice showed a reduced number and size of premalignant lesions and absence of pancreatic cancer formation in TGF-alpha transgenic mice . This effect is related to the decreased expression of P55008 to S cell-cycle regulators such as cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) 4 . Our data support the hypothesis that Q9P0J7 mediates pro-oncogenic functions in vitro and in vivo and downregulation of Q9P0J7 results in the inhibition of pancreatic cancer formation in mice . These effects are mediated through downregulation of cell-cycle control genes such as cyclin D and P11802 . Gating properties of Q14524 mutations and the response to mexiletine in long-QT syndrome type 3 patients . BACKGROUND : DB00379 ( Mex ) has been proposed as a gene-specific therapy for patients with long-QT syndrome type 3 ( LQT3 ) caused by mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene ( Q14524 ) . The degree of QT shortening and the protection from arrhythmias vary among patients harboring different mutations . We tested whether the clinical response to Mex in LQT3 could be predicted by the biophysical properties of the different mutations . METHODS AND RESULTS : We identified 4 Q14524 mutations in 5 symptomatic LQT3 patients with different responses to Mex ( 6 to 8 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) ) . We classified the mutations as sensitive to Mex ( P1332L , R1626P ; >/= 10 % of QTc shortening and QTc < 500 ms or no arrhythmias ) or insensitive to Mex ( S941N , M1652R ; negligible or no QTc shortening and sudden death ) . We measured Na(+) current from P29320 293 cells transfected with wild-type ( WT ) or mutant Nav1.5 . All mutations showed impaired inactivation of Na(+) current , but the mutations identified in patient responders to Mex ( P1332L , R1626P ) showed a hyperpolarizing shift of V(1/2) of steady-state inactivation . Furthermore , Mex produced use-dependent block with the order R1626P=P1332L > S941N=WT > M1652R , suggesting that Mex-sensitive mutants present prolonged recovery from Mex block . CONCLUSIONS : We propose that voltage dependence of channel availability and shifts of V(1/2) of steady-state inactivation correlate with the clinical response observed in LQT3 patients . This supports the view that the response to Mex is mutation specific and that in vitro testing may help to predict the response to therapy in LQT3 . The antiproliferative effect of lidocaine on human tongue cancer cells with inhibition of the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor . Local anesthetics suppress proliferation in several cancer cells . The mechanism of the suppression , however , is unknown . Our previous study shows that lidocaine , at the level of tissue concentration under topical or local administration , has a direct inhibitory effect on the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , which is a potential target for antiproliferation in cancer cells . Therefore , we hypothesized that lidocaine would suppress the proliferation of cancer cells through the inhibition of P00533 activity . We investigated the effects of lidocaine ( 40-4000 microM ) on proliferation of a human tongue cancer cell line , CAL27 , which has a high level of P00533 expression , and also examined the effect of lidocaine on epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) -stimulated autophosphorylation of P00533 in CAL27 cells . A clinical concentration of lidocaine ( 400 microM ) suppressed both serum-induced and P01133 -induced proliferation of CAL27 cells and inhibited P01133 -stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of P00533 without cytotoxicity . A larger concentration of lidocaine ( 4000 microM ) showed cytotoxicity with an antiproliferative effect . We suggest that the inhibition of P01133 -stimulated P00533 activity is one of the mechanisms of the antiproliferative effect of lidocaine on CAL27 cells . DB00281 administered topically within the oral cavity for cancer pain relief may suppress the proliferation of human tongue cancer cells .
P00750 ( tPA ) promotes M1 macrophage survival through p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway . Macrophage accumulation is one of the hallmarks of progressive kidney disease . Resting macrophages have a finite lifespan , but become resistant to apoptosis in response to pathogenic cues , whereas the underlying mechanism remains unknown . P00750 ( tPA ) , a protease up-regulated in the kidneys with chronic injury , has been shown to promote macrophage accumulation and renal inflammation . We hypothesized that tPA may be the endogenous factor that promotes macrophage survival and extends their lifespan that leads to their accumulation in the injured kidneys . We examined the role of tPA in macrophage survival , and found that tPA protected macrophages from both staurosporine and H2O2-induced apoptosis . tPA promoted the survival of both resting and lipopolysaccharide- or interferon-γ-induced M1 macrophages , but failed to do so in the interleukin 4 ( P05112 ) -induced M2 macrophages . In the kidneys with unilateral ureteral obstruction , there were significantly more apoptotic M1 macrophages in tPA-deficient mice than their wild-type counterparts , and obstruction-induced M1 macrophages accumulation and M1 chemokine expression were markedly reduced in these knock-out mice . The cytoprotective effect of tPA required its receptor , P01130 -related protein-1 ( Q07954 ) . tPA induced the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 , p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) , and p38 in a temporal order . The tPA-mediated macrophage survival was eliminated by PD98059 , BI-D1870 , or sc68376 , the specific inhibitors for Erk1/2 , p90RSK , or p38 , respectively . Thus , it is clear that tPA promoted M1 macrophage survival through its receptor Q07954 -mediated novel signaling cascade involving Erk1/2 , p90RSK , and p38 , which leads to the accumulation of these cells in the injured kidneys . Q9Y6X2 negatively regulates O14788 -mediated osteoclastogenesis directly in osteoclast precursors and indirectly via osteoblasts . Cytokine signaling via various transcription factors regulates receptor activator of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) -mediated osteoclast differentiation from monocyte/macrophage lineage cells involved in propagation and resolution of inflammatory bone destruction . Protein inhibitor of activated P40763 ( Q9Y6X2 ) was initially identified as a molecule that inhibits DNA binding of P40763 and regulates many transcription factors through distinct mechanisms . To analyze Q9Y6X2 function in osteoclasts in vivo , we have generated transgenic mice in which Q9Y6X2 is specifically expressed in the osteoclast lineage using the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) gene promoter . Q9Y6X2 transgenic mice showed an osteopetrotic phenotype due to impairment of osteoclast differentiation . Overexpression of Q9Y6X2 in RAW264.7 cells suppressed O14788 -induced osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the expression of c-Fos and O95644 . Interestingly , Q9Y6X2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor ( O75030 ) independent of sumoylation . Down-regulation of Q9Y6X2 markedly enhances O14788 -mediated osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells . Furthermore , overexpression of Q9Y6X2 in mouse primary osteoblast ( DB00925 ) , down-regulates O14788 expression induced by interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) cytokine family , and inhibits osteoclast formation from bone marrow macrophages ( BMMs ) in vitro coculture system . Down-regulation of Q9Y6X2 leads to the accelerated expression of O14788 in DB00925 stimulated with P05231 and soluble P05231 receptor ( sIL-6R ) . Taken together , our results clearly indicate that Q9Y6X2 negatively regulates O14788 -mediated osteoclastogenesis directly in osteoclast precursors and indirectly via osteoblasts . Drug-induced activation of SREBP-controlled lipogenic gene expression in CNS-related cell lines : marked differences between various antipsychotic drugs . BACKGROUND : The etiology of schizophrenia is unknown , but neurodevelopmental disturbances , myelin- and oligodendrocyte abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction have been suggested as pathophysiological factors in this severe psychiatric disorder . DB04540 is an essential component of myelin and has proved important for synapse formation . Recently , we demonstrated that the antipsychotic drugs clozapine and haloperidol stimulate lipogenic gene expression in cultured glioma cells through activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein ( SREBP ) transcription factors . We here compare the action of chlorpromazine , haloperidol , clozapine , olanzapine , risperidone and ziprasidone on SREBP activation and SREBP-controlled gene expression ( ACAT2 , P04035 , Q01581 , P14324 , O75845 , Q9UBM7 , P01130 , P49327 and SCD1 ) in four CNS-relevant human cell lines . RESULTS : There were marked differences in the ability of the antipsychotic drugs to activate the expression of SREBP target genes , with clozapine and chlorpromazine as the most potent stimulators in a context of therapeutically relevant concentrations . Glial-like cells ( GaMg glioma and CCF-STTG1 astrocytoma cell lines ) displayed more pronounced drug-induced SREBP activation compared to the response in Q9UL51 human cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells , indicating that antipsychotic-induced activation of lipogenesis is most prominent in glial cells . CONCLUSION : Our present data show a marked variation in the ability of different antipsychotics to induce SREBP-controlled transcriptional activation of lipogenesis in cultured human CNS-relevant cells . We propose that this effect could be relevant for the therapeutic efficacy of some antipsychotic drugs . Mechanism of aminobisphosphonate action : characterization of alendronate inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway . DB00630 ( ALN ) , an aminobisphosphonate compound used for the treatment of osteoporosis and other disorders of bone resorption , has been suggested to act by inhibition of the formation of GGPP . In the present study we used an S(10) homogenate fraction of rat liver to show that ALN causes a dose-dependent inhibition of [(3)H]MVA incorporation into sterols and a concomitant increase in incorporation of radiolabel into IPP and DMAPP . We further show that ALN is a potent inhibitor of cytosolic trans-prenyltransferase ( P14324 ) . The inhibition is competitive with respect to allylic pyrophosphate substrates , but not IPP , suggesting that ALN acts as an allylic pyrophosphate analog and binds to the free enzyme . The K(i) is in the 0.5 microM range . Genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations and gene expression in gastric cancer . Genomic copy number aberrations ( CNAs ) are believed to play a major role in the development and progression of human cancers . Although many CNAs have been reported in gastric cancer , their genome-wide transcriptional consequences are poorly understood . In this study , to reveal the impact of CNAs on genome-wide expression in gastric cancer , we analysed 30 cases of gastric cancers for their CNAs by array comparative genomic hybridization ( array CGH ) and 24 of these 30 cases for their expression profiles by oligonucleotide-expression microarray . We found that with the application of laser microdissection , most CNAs were detected at higher frequency than in previous studies . Notably , gain at 20q13 was detected in almost all cases ( 97 % ) , suggesting that this may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer . By comparing the array CGH data with expression profiles of the same samples , we showed that both genomic amplification and deletion strongly influence the expression of genes in altered genomic regions . Furthermore , we identified 125 candidate genes , consisting of 114 up-regulated genes located in recurrent regions ( > 10 % ) of amplification and 11 down-regulated genes located in recurrent regions of deletion . Up-regulation of several candidate genes , such as Q99741 , P60059 , Q9BTT0 , Q13895 and P37268 , was confirmed by immunohistochemistry . Interestingly , some candidate genes were localized at genomic loci adjacent to well-known genes such as P00533 , P04626 and Q13485 , and concordantly deregulated by genomic alterations . Based on these results , we propose that our list of candidate genes may contain novel genes involved in the pathogenesis of advanced gastric cancer . Small interfering RNA knocks down the molecular target of alendronate , farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase , in osteoclast and osteoblast cultures . P14324 ( FPPS ) , an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway , is the inhibition target of alendronate , a potent FDA-approved nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate ( N-BP ) drug , at the molecular level . DB00630 not only inhibits osteoclasts but also has been reported to positively affect osteoblasts . This study assesses the knockdown effects of siRNA targeting FPPS compared with alendronate in both osteoclast and osteoblast cultures . Primary murine bone marrow cell-induced osteoclasts and the preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell line were used to assess effects of anti-FPPS siRNA compared with alendronate . Results show that both FPPS mRNA message and protein knockdown in serum-based culture is correlated with reduced osteoclast viability . FPPS siRNA is more potent than 10 μM alendronate , but less potent than 50 μM alendronate on reducing osteoclast viability . Despite FPPS knockdown , no significant changes were observed in osteoblast proliferation . FPPS knockdown promotes osteoblast differentiation significantly but not cell mineral deposition . However , compared with 50 μM alendronate dosing , FPPS siRNA does not exhibit cytotoxic effects on osteoblasts while producing significant effects on ostoblast differentiation . Both siRNA and alendronate at tested concentrations do not have significant effects on cultured osteoblast mineralization . Overall , results indicate that siRNA against FPPS could be useful for selectively inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and improving bone mass maintenance by influencing both osteoclasts and osteoblasts in distinct ways . Role of xanthine oxidoreductase and NAD(P)H oxidase in endothelial superoxide production in response to oscillatory shear stress . Oscillatory shear stress occurs at sites of the circulation that are vulnerable to atherosclerosis . Because oxidative stress contributes to atherosclerosis , we sought to determine whether oscillatory shear stress increases endothelial production of reactive oxygen species and to define the enzymes responsible for this phenomenon . Bovine aortic endothelial cells were exposed to static , laminar ( 15 dyn/cm2 ) , and oscillatory shear stress ( +/-15 dyn/cm2 ) . Oscillatory shear increased superoxide ( O2.- ) production by more than threefold over static and laminar conditions as detected using electron spin resonance ( P03372 ) . This increase in O2*- was inhibited by oxypurinol and culture of endothelial cells with tungsten but not by inhibitors of other enzymatic sources . DB05262 also prevented H2O2 production in response to oscillatory shear stress as measured by dichlorofluorescin diacetate and Amplex Red fluorescence . DB02134 -dependent O2*- production was increased in homogenates of endothelial cells exposed to oscillatory shear stress . This was associated with decreased xanthine dehydrogenase ( P47989 ) protein levels and enzymatic activity resulting in an elevated ratio of xanthine oxidase ( XO ) to P47989 . We also studied endothelial cells lacking the p47phox subunit of the NAD(P)H oxidase . These cells exhibited dramatically depressed O2*- production and had minimal XO protein and activity . Transfection of these cells with p47phox restored XO protein levels . Finally , in bovine aortic endothelial cells , prolonged inhibition of the NAD(P)H oxidase with apocynin decreased XO protein levels and prevented endothelial cell stimulation of O2*- production in response to oscillatory shear stress . These data suggest that the NAD(P)H oxidase maintains endothelial cell XO levels and that XO is responsible for increased reactive oxygen species production in response to oscillatory shear stress . Caenorhabditis elegans expressed sequence tags identify gene families and potential disease gene homologues . A database containing mapped partial cDNA sequences from Caenorhabditis elegans will provide a ready starting point for identifying nematode homologues of important human genes and determining their functions in C. elegans . A total of 720 expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) have been generated from 585 clones randomly selected from a mixed-stage C. elegans cDNA library . Comparison of these ESTs with sequence databases identified 422 new C. elegans genes , of which 317 are not similar to any sequences in the database . Twenty-six new genes have been mapped by YAC clone hybridization . Members of several gene families , including cuticle collagens , GTP-binding proteins , and RNA helicases were discovered . Many of the new genes are similar to known or potential human disease genes , including P13569 and the P01130 . In vivo analysis of folate coenzymes and their compartmentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In eukaryotes , enzymes responsible for the interconversion of one-carbon units exist in parallel in both mitochondria and the cytoplasm . Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were constructed that possess combinations of gene disruptions at the SHM1 [ mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( SHMTm ) ] , SHM2 [ cytoplasmic SHMT ( SHMTc ) ] , MIS1 [ mitochondrial C1- DB00116 synthase ( C1-THFSm ) ] , ADE3 [ cytoplasmic P11586 ( C1-THFSc ) ] , GCV1 [ glycine cleavage system ( GCV ) protein T ] , and the GLY1 ( involved in glycine synthesis ) loci . Analysis of the in vivo growth characteristics and phenotypes was used to determine the contribution to cytoplasmic nucleic acid and amino acid anabolism by the mitochondrial enzymes involved in the interconversion of folate coenzymes . The data indicate that mitochondria transport formate to the cytoplasmic compartment and mitochondrial synthesis of formate appears to rely primarily on SHMTm rather than the glycine cleavage system . The glycine cleavage system and SHMTm cooperate to specifically synthesize serine . With the inactivation of SHM1 , however , the glycine cleavage system can make an observable contribution to the level of mitochondrial formate . Inactivation of SHM1 , SHM2 and ADE3 is required to render yeast auxotrophic for P54849 and methionine , suggesting that P54849 synthesized in mitochondria may be available to the cytoplasmic compartment . Inhibition of farnesylpyrophosphate synthase prevents angiotensin II-induced hypertrophic responses in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes : involvement of the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway . The RhoA/Rho-kinase ( ROCK ) pathway is involved in angiotensin ( Ang ) II-induced cardiac hypertrophy . However , it is still unclear whether inhibition of farnesylpyrophosphate ( FPP ) synthase can attenuate Ang II-induced hypertrophic responses , and whether it involves the RhoA/ROCK pathway . The anti-hypertrophic effects of inhibition of P14324 with alendronate in Ang II-cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes were partially reversed by geranylgeranyol ( GGOH ) and were mimicked by GGTI-286 , a geranylgeranyl transferase-I inhibitor , P01024 exoenzyme , an inhibitor of Rho , or Y-27632 , an inhibitor of ROCK . Pull-down assay showed alendronate reduced-active RhoA by Ang II was also partially antagonized by GGOH . This study revealed that the inhibition of P14324 by alendronate reduces RhoA activation by diminishing geranylgeranylation which prevents Ang II-induced hypertrophic responses in neonatal cardiomyocytes . Phenotypic and molecular evaluation of a chromosome 1q region with linkage and association to type 2 diabetes in humans . OBJECTIVE : Linkage to type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is well replicated on chromosome 1q21-q23 . Within this region , T2D was associated with common single nucleotide polymorphisms that marked an extended linkage disequilibrium block , including the liver pyruvate kinase gene ( P30613 ) , in several European-derived populations . In this study we sought to determine the molecular basis for the association and the phenotypic consequences of the risk haplotype . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Genes surrounding P30613 were resequenced in European-American and African-American cases and controls , and association with T2D was tested . Copy number variants ( CNVs ) were tested for four regions with real-time PCR . Expression of genes in the region was tested in adipose and muscle from nondiabetic subjects with each genotype . P01308 secretion , insulin sensitivity , and hepatic glucose production were tested in nondiabetic individuals with each haplotype combination . RESULTS : No coding variant in the region was associated with T2D . CNVs were rare and not associated with T2D . P30613 was not expressed in available tissues , but expression of genes Q9P1Z3 , P49760 , O14828 , and P14324 was not associated with haplotype combinations in adipose or muscle . Haplotype combinations were not associated with insulin secretion or peripheral insulin sensitivity , but homozygous carriers of the risk haplotype had increased hepatic glucose production during hyperinsulinemia . CONCLUSIONS : Noncoding variants in the P30613 region likely alter gene expression of one or more genes . Our extensive physiological and molecular studies suggest increased hepatic glucose production and reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity , thus pointing to P30613 itself as the most likely candidate gene in this population . Design of novel potent antihyperlipidemic agents with antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties : exploiting phenothiazine 's strong antioxidant activity . Because atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process involving a series of pathological events such as dyslipidemia , oxidative stress , and blood clotting mechanisms , we hereby report the synthesis and evaluation of novel compounds in which antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and squalene synthase ( P37268 ) inhibitory/hypolipidemic activities are combined in simple molecules through design . The coupling of two different pharmacophores afforded compounds 1-12 , whose biological profile was markedly improved compared to those of parent lead structures ( i.e. , the hypolipidemic 2-hydroxy-2-aryl-(benzo)oxa ( or thia ) zine and the antioxidant phenothiazine ) . Most derivatives strongly inhibited in vitro microsomal lipid and LDL peroxidation , exhibiting potent free-radical scavenging activity . They further significantly inhibited P37268 activity and showed remarkable antidyslipidemic activity in vivo in animal models of acute and high-fat-induced hyperlipidemia . Finally , several compounds showed anti-inflammatory activity in vitro , inhibiting cycloxygenase ( P23219 /2 ) activity . The multimodal properties of the new compounds and especially their combined antioxidant/ P37268 / P36551 inhibitory activity render them interesting lead compounds for further evaluation against atherosclerosis . Increase in intracellular Cl- concentration by DB02527 - and Ca2+-dependent stimulation of M1 collecting duct cells . In the lungs of cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients , mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) lead to defective Cl- secretion and hyperabsorption of electrolytes . This may be a an important cause for the defective mucociliary clearance in CF lungs . Previous studies have suggested that inhibition of ENaC during activation of P13569 or by purinergic stimulation could be related to an increase in the intracellular [Cl-]i . This was examined in the present study using cultured mouse M1 collecting duct cells transfected with the chloride-sensitive enhanced yellow fluorescent protein YFP(V163S) . Calibration experiments showed a linear decrease of YFP fluorescence intensity with increasing [Cl-]i ( 0-100 mM ) . Activation of P13569 by isobutyl-1-methylxanthine ( DB07954 , 100 microM ) and forskolin ( 2 microM ) increased [Cl-]i by 9.6+/-1.5 mM ( n=35 ) . Similarly , DB00171 ( 100 microM ) increased [Cl-]i transiently by 9.5+/-2.2 mM ( n=17 ) . The increase in [Cl-]i was reduced by the Na+/K+/2 Cl- -cortransporter-1 ( P55011 ) blocker azosemide ( 100 microM ) , the P13569 blocker DB04941 ( 50 microM ) , the blocker of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels DIDS ( 100 microM ) or the ENaC blocker amiloride ( 10 microM ) . Changes in YFP(V163S) fluorescence were not due to changes in cell volume or intracellular pH . The present data thus demonstrate an increase in [Cl-]i following stimulation with secretagogues , which could participate in the inhibition of ENaC . Clinical outcome and cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression in five dogs with solar dermatitis/actinic keratosis treated with firocoxib . BACKGROUND : The conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin is catalysed by the cyclo-oxygenases ( P23219 / P35354 ) . Several studies indicate that P35354 is overexpressed in actinic keratosis in humans and dogs . DB09217 is a P35354 -selective inhibitor that blocks the biochemical activity of P35354 . HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the efficacy of firocoxib ( 5 mg/kg orally once daily ) for the treatment of dogs with solar dermatitis/actinic keratosis . METHODS : DB09217 5 mg/kg was given orally once daily for 180 days to five dogs with clinical signs and histopathological lesions consistent with solar dermatitis/actinic keratosis . On days 0 , 50 and 180 , the severity of erythema , skin shine , induration and the number of comedones were evaluated by a clinical scoring system . On the same days , samples were collected for histopathology from ' target lesions ' and P35354 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : The clinical follow-up showed that four of five dogs improved with the treatment ; improvement in terms of histological findings was correlated with the regularization of the epidermal proliferation rather than the recovery of dermal changes . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE : A role for P35354 might thus be hypothesized in the pathogenesis of canine solar dermatitis . DB00072 emtansine : the first targeted chemotherapy for treatment of breast cancer . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate , comprised of a potent cytotoxic drug connected via a stable linker to the anti- P04626 antibody , trastuzumab , thereby primarily targeting chemotherapy delivery to cells overexpressing the P04626 receptor . A Phase II randomized trial of DB05773 in the front-line metastatic breast cancer setting revealed promising activity and improved safety compared with standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab . Subsequently , a Phase III trial in patients with trastuzumab-pretreated metastatic breast cancer showed DB05773 to be associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine . DB05773 represents a major shift in the treatment of patients with breast cancer as it replaces traditional nontargeted chemotherapy with a ' smart ' medication that directs the cytotoxic therapy to cancer cells by using a known biomarker . Gene therapy-mediated delivery of targeted cytotoxins for glioma therapeutics . Restricting the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents by targeting receptors exclusively expressed on tumor cells is critical when treating infiltrative brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . GBMs express an P35225 receptor ( IL13Rα2 ) that differs from the physiological P24394 /IL13R receptor . We developed a regulatable adenoviral vector ( Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE ) encoding a mutated human P35225 fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin ( mhIL-13-PE ) that specifically binds to IL13Rα2 to provide sustained expression , effective anti-GBM cytotoxicity , and minimal neurotoxicity . The therapeutic Ad also encodes mutated human P05112 that binds to the physiological P24394 /IL13R without interacting with IL13Rα2 , thus inhibiting potential binding of mhIL-13-PE to normal brain cells . Using intracranial GBM xenografts and syngeneic mouse models , we tested the Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE and two protein formulations , hIL-13-PE used in clinical trials ( DB05305 ) and a second-generation mhIL-13-PE . DB05305 doubled median survival without eliciting long-term survival and caused severe neurotoxicity ; mhIL-13-PE led to ∼40 % long-term survival , eliciting severe neurological toxicity at the high dose tested . In contrast , Ad-mediated delivery of mhIL-13-PE led to tumor regression and long-term survival in over 70 % of the animals , without causing apparent neurotoxicity . Although DB05305 was originally developed to target GBM , when tested in a phase III trial it failed to achieve clinical endpoints and revealed neurotoxicity . Limitations of DB05305 include its short half-life , which demanded frequent or continued administration , and binding to P24394 /IL13R , present in normal brain cells . These shortcomings were overcome by our therapeutic Ad , thus representing a significant advance in the development of targeted therapeutics for GBM . 13C nuclear magnetic resonance detection of interactions of serine hydroxymethyltransferase with C1- DB00116 synthase and glycine decarboxylase complex activities in Arabidopsis . In P01024 plants , serine synthesis is associated with photorespiratory glycine metabolism involving the DB00116 ( DB00116 ) -dependent activities of the glycine decarboxylase complex ( P16260 ) and serine hydroxymethyl transferase ( SHMT ) . Alternatively , DB00116 -dependent serine synthesis can occur via the P11586 /SHMT pathway . We used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance to examine serine biosynthesis by these two pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana ( L. ) Heynh . Columbia wild type . We confirmed the tight coupling of the P16260 / SHMT system and observed directly in a higher plant the flux of formate through the P11586 /SHMT system . The accumulation of 13C-enriched serine over 24 h from the P16260 /SHMT activities was 4-fold greater than that from P11586 /SHMT activities . Our experiments strongly suggest that the two pathways operate independently in Arabidopsis . Plants exposed to methotrexate and sulfanilamide , powerful inhibitors of DB00116 biosynthesis , reduced serine synthesis by both pathways . The results suggest that continuous supply of DB00116 is essential to maintain high rates of serine metabolism . Nuclear magnetic resonance is a powerful tool for the examination of DB00116 -mediated metabolism in its natural cellular environment . A novel bisphosphonate inhibitor of squalene synthase combined with a statin or a nitrogenous bisphosphonate in vitro . Statins and nitrogenous bisphosphonates ( NBP ) inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase ( P04035 ) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( P14324 ) , respectively , leading to depletion of farnesyl diphosphate ( FPP ) and disruption of protein prenylation . P37268 ( P37268 ) utilizes FPP in the first committed step from the mevalonate pathway toward cholesterol biosynthesis . Herein , we have identified novel bisphosphonates as potent and specific inhibitors of P37268 , including the tetrasodium salt of 9-biphenyl-4,8-dimethyl-nona-3,7-dienyl-1,1-bisphosphonic acid ( compound 5 ) . Compound 5 reduced cholesterol biosynthesis and lead to a substantial intracellular accumulation of FPP without reducing cell viability in HepG2 cells . At high concentrations , lovastatin and zoledronate impaired protein prenylation and decreased cell viability , which limits their potential use for cholesterol depletion . When combined with lovastatin , compound 5 prevented lovastatin-induced FPP depletion and impairment of protein farnesylation . Compound 5 in combination with the NBP zoledronate completely prevented zoledronate-induced impairment of both protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation . Cotreatment of cells with compound 5 and either lovastatin or zoledronate was able to significantly prevent the reduction of cell viability caused by lovastatin or zoledronate alone . The combination of an P37268 inhibitor with an P04035 or P14324 inhibitor provides a rational approach for reducing cholesterol synthesis while preventing nonsterol isoprenoid depletion . [ mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in mouse mammary gland in different lactation stages ] . To investigate the expression pattern of lipogenic genes in mammary gland of mouse in different lactation stages , the relative mRNA abundance and expression of 20 genes involved in milk fat synthesis and secretion of lactating mammary tissues were assessed using real-time PCR . Results revealed the significant upregulation of mRNA expression for both high abundant genes ( abundance > 5 % ) , such as P06858 , Q13085 , O00767 , P47989 , Q13410 , and Q99541 and moderate abundant genes ( 5 % > abundance > 1 % ) , such as P16671 , P49327 , Q86UL3 , and O75907 in lactation stages compared to pregnancy ( P < 0.05 ) . The mRNA expression of lipogenic enzyme genes for Q13085 , O00767 , P49327 , Q86UL3 , and O75907 exhibited lower expression lever in early ( 6 d ) and late ( 18 d ) lactation stages but higher expression level at middle stage ( 12 d ) , demonstrating a low-high-low pattern . Besides , the mRNA levels of some gene regulators were also measured . The mRNA expression of SREBF gene increased gradually along with the lactation , which showed a 10-fold elevation at middle stage ( 12 d ) . The expression pattern of SREBF gene was the same as lipogenic enzyme genes , suggesting that SREBF may play an important role in the regulation of lipogenic enzyme genes in the lactating mammary gland . P01308 -like growth factor-I is a serum component stimulating growth of human neuroblastoma . Human non-autocrine neuroblastoma cells SK-N-SH and LF require serum for proliferation in vitro . We wished to determine the role of serum-borne insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) as mitogen for these cells . Introduction of the monoclonal antibody alpha-IR3 against human P08069 reduced proliferation in the presence of fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . P05019 ( 5 nM ) was as effective as FBS ( 10 % ) in stimulating proliferation . DB00071 mimicked the effects of P05019 , but at a 1000-fold higher concentration . The antibody alpha-IR3 reduced growth stimulated by P05019 more effectively than growth stimulated by insulin . Thus , proliferation of human non-autocrine neuroblastoma cells can be effectively manipulated by exogenous P05019 . Effect of postponed treatment with an anti-tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) F(ab')2 fragment on endotoxin-induced cytokine and neutrophil responses in chimpanzees . P01375 is considered to be an intermediate factor in endotoxin-induced release of other cytokines and endotoxin-induced neutrophil degranulation . Little is known about the effect of postponed treatment with anti- P01375 in primate endotoxin models . To assess the effect of delayed treatment with anti- P01375 in endotoxaemia , six healthy adult chimpanzees were intravenously injected with Escherichia coli endotoxin ( 4 ng/kg ) . In three of these animals the administration of endotoxin was followed after 30 min by a bolus i.v. injection of the anti- P01375 F(ab')2 fragment DB04956 ( 0.1 mg/kg ) . Post-treatment with DB04956 completely prevented the appearance of P01375 activity in serum elicited by endotoxin , and markedly reduced the rises in the serum concentrations of P05231 and P10145 . In addition , the endotoxin-induced increases in the type I and type II soluble P01375 receptors were also profoundly inhibited by DB04956 , suggesting that P01375 is involved in the release of its own soluble receptors in endotoxaemia . Neutrophilic leucocytosis was not affected by DB04956 . In contrast , DB04956 did significantly abrogate neutrophil degranulation , as measured by the plasma concentrations of lactoferrin . These results indicate that treatment with anti- P01375 30 min after the administration of endotoxin is still effective in attenuating the induction of the cytokine network and of neutrophil degranulation . Differential effects of endotoxin and fibrinogen degradation products ( P14324 ) on liver synthesis of fibrinogen and albumin : evidence for the involvement of a novel monokine in the stimulation of fibrinogen synthesis induced by P14324 . 1. Administration of endotoxin or fibrinogen degradation products ( FDPs ) in rats increase fibrinogen synthesis comparable to that found during the acute phase response . 2 . An increased fibrinogen synthesis is also found in co-cultures of hepatocytes with peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon administration of endotoxin or FDPs , but not in primary cultures of hepatocytes alone . 3 . However , the increased synthesis of fibrinogen by FDPs is not accompanied by a decreased albumin synthesis , as in the case of stimulated fibrinogen synthesis induced by endotoxin in vivo and in co-cultures of hepatocytes with peripheral blood mononuclear cells , or induced by monocytic products in vivo and in primary cultures of hepatocytes alone . 4 . Since IL-1 and/or P05231 could not be accounted for the stimulation of fibrinogen synthesis without a decreased albumin synthesis , a novel monokine produced by mononuclear cells upon Q9NRC9 administration might be involved . DB00338 , a gastric proton pump inhibitor , inhibits melanogenesis by blocking Q04656 trafficking . DB00338 is a proton pump inhibitor used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastrosophageal reflux disease and acts by irreversibly blocking P20648 , a P-type H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells . We found that omeprazole and its closely related congeners inhibited melanogenesis at micromolar concentrations in B16 mouse melanoma cells , normal human epidermal melanocytes , and in a reconstructed human skin model . DB00338 topically applied to the skin of UV-irradiated human subjects significantly reduced pigment levels after 3 weeks compared with untreated controls . DB00338 had no significant inhibitory effect on the activities of purified human tyrosinase or on the mRNA levels of tyrosinase , dopachrome tautomerase , Pmel17 , or O75030 mRNA levels . Although melanocytes do not express P20648 , they do express Q04656 , a copper transporting P-type ATPase in the trans-Golgi network that is required for copper acquisition by tyrosinase . Q04656 relocalization from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane in response to elevated copper concentrations in melanocytes was inhibited by omeprazole . DB00338 treatment increased the proportion of EndoH sensitive tyrosinase , indicating that tyrosinase maturation was impaired . In addition , omeprazole reduced tyrosinase protein abundance in the presence of cycloheximide , suggestive of increased degradation . Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that omeprazole reduces melanogenesis by inhibiting Q04656 and by enhancing degradation of tyrosinase . [ Genetics and pharmacogenetics of osteoporosis ] . Osteoporosis is a serious disease characterized by high morbidity and mortality due to atraumatic fractures . In pathogenesis of osteoporosis , except environment , internal factors , such as hormonal dysbalance and genetic background , are also in play . In this review , candidate genes for osteoporosis are classified according to metabolic or hormonal pathways , which regulate bone mineral density/and or quality ( estrogen , O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 / O00300 , mevalonate , Wnt circuit , genes for collagen and vitamin D ) . Authors discuss the perspectives of practical utilization of pharmacogenetics ( identification of single candidate genes using PCR ) or pharmacogenomics ( using genome wide association studies ) in choice of optimal treatment of osteoporosis . Potentional predictors of effectivity of antiresorption therapy are genes ER , P14324 , Cyp19A1 , P11473 , Col1A1 and gene of Wnt pathway . Moreover , polymorphisms of CYP2C gene , but also P14324 may identify patients with high risk of undesirable effects of bisphosphonates ( osteonecrosis of jaw ) . Unfortunately , results of the most association studies has not been confirmed by other investigators . The controversial results could be explained by different methodic approaches in individual studies ( different sample size , homogenity of investigated groups , ethnic differences or linkage disquilibrium between genes ) . Key cliff of association studies is low variability ( 7-10 % ) of bone phenotypes associated with investigated genes . Nevertheless , identification of new genes and verification their association with bone density and/or quality using both PCR and genome wide association studies remain to be a great challenge targeting optimal prevention and treatment of osteoporosis .
Evaluation of pharmacological profile of meloxicam as an anti-inflammatory agent , with particular reference to its relative selectivity for cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1 . We studied the anti-inflammatory activity of meloxicam on rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy and its toxicity for rat gastric mucosa , relative to its in vitro inhibitory potency against partially purified cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 preparations in order to clarify the pharmacological profile of the compound as an anti-inflammatory agent . In rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy , the plasma exudation rate peaked at 5 h , at which time P35354 was detectable in cells from the pleural exudate . Meloxicam and piroxicam ( 1 and 3 mg/kg ) and NS-398 ( 3 mg/kg ) showed almost equal anti-inflammatory potency against 5-hour pleurisy . A single oral administration of the compounds caused a dose-dependent increase in the number of rats with gastric mucosal erosion . The ED50 value for meloxicam ( 5.92 mg/kg ) was significantly higher than that for piroxicam ( 1.76 mg/kg ) , indicating that meloxicam is safer . DB00328 showed intermediate safety ( 2.59 mg/kg ) . In in vitro experiments , indometacin inhibited P23219 about 1.7 times more potently than P35354 . NS-398 inhibited P35354 with an IC50 of 0.32 microM , but never affected P23219 activity , even at 100 microM . In the same assay system , meloxicam inhibited P35354 about 12 times more selectively than P23219 . Piroxicam , however , inhibited both isoforms almost equally . These results indicate that meloxicam is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with low gastric toxicity . One reason for its in vivo pharmacological profile may be related to its relative selectivity for P35354 over P23219 . Thus , meloxicam may belong to a group of P35354 selective anti-inflammatory agents with a better safety profile than conventional P23219 and P35354 nonselective anti-inflammatory agents . Anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs and pharmacogenetic considerations . INTRODUCTION : The development of pharmacogenetic-based clinical practice guidelines for the use of anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs requires , as a pre-requisite , the identification and validation of genetic biomarkers . These biomarkers are then used as surrogate endpoints . This review analyzes potential genetic biomarkers which can be used to improve anti-Parkinson 's disease therapy . AREAS COVERED : The authors present an overview of current knowledge of pharmacogenetic implications of anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs , including genes coding for the corresponding drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug targets . The gene/drug pairings with the strongest potential for pharmacogenetic recommendations include : P33261 /benztropine , P21964 /levodopa and entacapone , P20813 /selegiline , P22309 /entacapone , P14416 /ropinirole , pramipexole and cabergoline , and P35462 /ropinirole and pramipexole . Evidence supporting the effect of substrates , inhibitor or inducers for drug specific metabolizing enzymes in anti-Parkinson 's disease drug response includes P05177 in the response to ropinirole and rasagiline , and P08684 in the response to bromocriptine , lisuride , pergolide and cabergoline . The authors present and discuss the current information on gene variations according to the 1000 genomes catalog and other databases with regards to anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs . They also review and discuss the clinical implications of these variations . EXPERT OPINION : The goal of pharmacogenomic testing for anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs should be conservative and aimed at selecting determined drugs for determined patients . However , much additional research is still needed to obtain reliable pre-prescription tests . A case of a novel mutant vasopressin receptor-dependent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with bilateral non-obstructive hydronephrosis in a middle aged man : differentiation from aquaporin-dependent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by response of factor VII and P04275 to 1-diamino-8-arginine vasopressin administration . We describe a case of a novel mutant vasopressin 2 receptor ( P30518 ) -dependent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) with bilateral non-obstructive hydronephrosis in a middle aged man . This could be distinguished from aquaporin 2 ( P41181 ) -dependent NDI by the response of factor VIII and P04275 ( P04275 ) to DB00035 ( DB00035 ) administration . A 47-year-old man was admitted to hospital because of polyuria , which had been present from infancy and was suspected of causing non-obstructive hydronephrosis . DB00117 mother 's father , the older brother of his mother and his second daughter also all had polyuria . Sodium concentration , osmolality and vasopressin in blood were high , while sodium concentration and osmolality in urine were low . There were no changes in urine osmolality , factor VIII and P04275 in response to DB00035 infusion . Neither was heart rate , diastolic blood pressure nor facial flushing affected . These findings suggested this case was P30518 -dependent NDI rather than P41181 -dependent NDI . Molecular genetic analysis demonstrated that the patient had a P30518 missense mutation involving a substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 104 ( R104C ) located in the first extracellular loop of the P30518 . It was also found that the patient 's mother and his second daughter were heterozygous for this R104C mutation . Protective effect of treatment with low-dose gliclazide in a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion in rats . The aim of this study was to explore the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 ( Q09428 ) , the regulatory subunit of the NCCa- DB00171 channel , and to investigate the protective effects of gliclazide following middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) /reperfusion in male Wistar rats . Adult rats underwent 2h of the left MCAO using the intraluminal thread technique before reperfusion . The core areas of the infarct at different reperfusion time points were examined for the mRNA level and protein expression of Q09428 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and western blotting respectively . DB01120 was administered intravenously into the right jugular vein for 12h simultaneously with the reperfusion . The number of apoptotic cells was determined using the TUNEL assay . The neurological functional deficits were evaluated using Bederson׳s test , and the cerebral infarction volume was visualized with TTC staining . We found up-regulation of Q09428 mRNA and protein levels in ischemic infarct tissues after reperfusion following MCAO , and Q09428 mRNA and protein were maximally upregulated 8-12h after a 2-hour ischemia . The treatment with low-dose of gliclazide reduced the total number of TUNEL-positive cells , the neurological functional deficits and the brain infarct volume . These results suggest that the Q09428 -regulated NCCa- DB00171 channel may be associated with MCAO/reperfusion injury and the infarct-reducing effects of intravenous treatment with gliclazide may be due , in part , to the blocked upregulation of Q09428 expression , the decreased infarct size and the reduced apoptosis in the ischemia-reperfusion brain . Antidiabetic sulfonylurea enhances secretagogue-induced adrenocorticotropin secretion and proopiomelanocortin gene expression in vitro . The presence of high-affinity binding sites for antidiabetic sulfonylureas ( SUs ) and the expression of SU receptor ( Q09428 ) messenger RNA in the adenohypophyseal cells have recently been reported . In this study , we examined the effects of SU on P01189 gene expression and DB01285 secretion using the AtT20PL cell line , a subclone of AtT20 in which the rat P01189 5'-promoter-luciferase fusion gene was stably incorporated . A representative SU glibenclamide inhibited the basal P01189 5'-promoter activity . In contrast , glibenclamide enhanced forskolin- or P06850 -induced P01189 expression in a dose-dependent manner . Interestingly , the latter effect was not observed under treatment with DB07954 , a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor . Furthermore , diazoxide , an opener of the DB00171 -sensitive K+ channel , only antagonized the suppressive effect of glibenclamide . Lastly , RT-PCR analysis showed that mouse Q09428 ( but not SUR2 ) messenger RNA was expressed in this cell line . These results suggest that , in AtT20PL cells , SU has dual effects , i.e. a suppressive effect on basal P01189 expression through diazoxide-sensitive ( DB00171 -sensitive ) K+-channel-mediated mechanism , and an enhancing effect on DB02527 /protein kinase A-stimulated P01189 expression through a different mechanism ( probably mediated by phosphodiesterase ) . To our knowledge , this is the first report showing the effect of SU on the expression of the anterior pituitary hormone gene . P14416 desensitization by dopamine or corticotropin releasing factor in ventral tegmental area neurons is associated with increased glutamate release . Neurons of the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) are the source of dopaminergic ( DAergic ) input to important brain regions related to addiction . Prolonged exposure of these VTA neurons to moderate concentrations of dopamine ( DA ) causes a time-dependent decrease in DA-induced inhibition , a complex desensitization called DA inhibition reversal ( P30518 ) . P30518 is mediated by conventional protein kinase C ( cPKC ) through concurrent stimulation of D2 and D1-like DA receptors , or by D2 stimulation concurrent with activation of some Gq-linked receptors . DB01285 releasing factor ( CRF ) acts via Gq , and can modulate glutamater neurotransmission in the VTA . In the present study , we used brain slice electrophysiology to characterize the interaction of DA , glutamate antagonists , and CRF agonists in the induction and maintenance of P30518 in the VTA . Glutamate receptor antagonists blocked induction but not maintenance of P30518 . Putative blockers of neurotransmitter release and store-operated calcium channels blocked and reversed P30518 . CRF and the CRF agonist urocortin reversed inhibition produced by the D2 agonist quinpirole , consistent with our earlier work indicating that Gq activation reverses quinpirole-mediated inhibition . In whole cell recordings , the combination of urocortin and quinpirole , but not either agent alone , increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( sEPSCs ) in VTA neurons . Likewise , the combination of a D1-like receptor agonist and quinpirole , but not either agent alone , increased sEPSCs in VTA neurons . In summary , desensitization of D2 receptors induced by dopamine or CRF on DAergic VTA neurons is associated with increased glutamatergic signaling in the VTA . Altered regulation of renal nitric oxide , atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclooxygenase systems in aldosterone escape in rats . The present study was aimed to determine whether there is an altered role of local nitric oxide ( NO ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) systems in the kidney in association with the aldosterone escape . Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used . DB04630 ( 200 microg/day ) was infused through entire time course . The control group was kept on a low sodium diet ( 0.02 mEq/day ) , and the experimental group was supplied with a higher sodium diet ( 2. /day ) . Four days after beginning the regimen , the kidneys were taken . The protein expression of NO synthase ( NOS ) and P36551 isoforms was determined by semiquantitative immunoblotting . The mRNA expression of components of P01160 system was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction . The activities of soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclases were determined by the amount of cGMP generated in responses to sodium nitroprusside and P01160 , respectively . There developed aldosterone escape in the experimental group . Accordingly , the renal content and the urinary excretion of NO increased . The expression of P29475 was increased in the inner medulla . Neither the expression of P29474 nor that of P35228 was changed . The expression and the catalytic activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase remained unaltered . The mRNA expression of P01160 was increased . Neither the expression of P16066 or P17342 nor the activity of particulate guanylyl cyclase was altered in the papilla . The protein expression of P35354 was increased in the inner medulla , while that of P23219 remained unchanged . In conclusion , the upregulation of P29475 , P01160 , and P35354 may be causally related with the aldosterone escape . DB00067 -induced P04275 secretion from endothelial cells involves V2 receptors and DB02527 . DB00067 and its analogue DB00035 ( DB00035 ) are known to raise plasma P04275 ( P04275 ) levels . DB00035 is used as a hemostatic agent for the treatment of von Willebrand 's disease . However , its cellular mechanisms of action have not been elucidated . DB00035 , a specific agonist for the vasopressin V2 receptor ( P30518 ) , exerts its antidiuretic effect via a rise in DB02527 in kidney collecting ducts . We tested the hypothesis that DB00035 induces P04275 secretion by binding to P30518 and activating DB02527 -mediated signaling in endothelial cells . P04275 secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) can be mediated by DB02527 , but DB00035 is ineffective , presumably due to the absence of P30518 . We report that DB00035 stimulates P04275 secretion in a DB02527 -dependent manner in HUVECs after transfection of the P30518 . In addition , vasopressin and DB00035 induce P04275 secretion in human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( HMVEC-L ) . These cells ( but not HUVECs ) express endogenous P30518 , as shown by RT-PCR . DB00067 -induced P04275 secretion is mimicked by DB00035 and inhibited by the selective P30518 antagonist SR121463B . It is mediated by DB02527 , since it is inhibited by the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-8CPT-cAMPS . These results indicate that vasopressin induces DB02527 -mediated P04275 secretion by a direct effect on endothelial cells . They also demonstrate functional expression of P30518 in endothelial cells , and provide a cellular mechanism for the hemostatic effects of DB00035 . Protective effects of metallothionein on isoniazid and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity in mice . Isoniazid ( DB00951 ) and DB01045 ( RFP ) are widely used in the world for the treatment of tuberculosis , but the hepatotoxicity is a major concern during clinical therapy . Previous studies showed that these drugs induced oxidative stress in liver , and several antioxidants abated this effect . Metallothionein ( MT ) , a member of cysteine-rich protein , has been proposed as a potent antioxidant . This study attempts to determine whether endogenous expression of MT protects against DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatic oxidative stress in mice . Wild type ( MT+/+ ) and MT-null ( MT-/- ) mice were treated intragastrically with DB00951 ( 150 mg/kg ) , RFP ( 300 mg/kg ) , or the combination ( 150 mg/kg DB00951 +300 mg/kg RFP ) for 21 days . The results showed that MT-/- mice were more sensitive than MT+/+ mice to DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatic injuries as evidenced by hepatic histopathological alterations , increased serum Q9NRA2 levels and liver index , and hepatic oxidative stress as evidenced by the increase of MDA production and the change of liver antioxidant status . Furthermore , DB00951 increased the protein expression of hepatic P05181 and DB00951 /RFP ( alone or in combination ) decreased the expression of hepatic P05177 . These findings clearly demonstrate that basal MT provides protection against DB00951 and RFP-induced toxicity in hepatocytes . The P05181 and P05177 were involved in the pathogenesis of DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatotoxicity . Effects of Luteolin on Liver , Kidney and Brain in Pentylentetrazol-Induced Seizures : Involvement of Metalloproteinases and NOS Activities . OBJECTIVE : Flavonoids are an important group of recognized antioxidants in plants . Luteolin ( LUT ) is a natural flavonoid in the plant kingdom . This study was aimed to investigate the effects of the LUT in the liver , kidney and brain of pentylentetrazol ( PTZ ) -induced seizure and the relationship between nitric oxide synthases ( P35228 , P29474 ) and matrix metalloproteinases ( P08253 , P14780 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : LUT ( 10 mg/kg ) was given intraperitoneally during two weeks prior to seizure induction . A single dose PTZ 80 mg/kg i.p. was administered and seizures were observed and evaluated with regard to latency , frequency and stage for one hour . RESULTS : Seizure frequen cy after PTZ administration was significantly decreased in LUT pretreated rats ( p < 0.05 ) . An increase of immunhistochemical reactions of P35228 and P08253 , but a decrease of P29474 activity , were observed in rat hippocampus and peripheral tissues during the PTZ induced seizures . LUT pretreatment reversed the P35228 and P08253 activity to the control levels and significantly increased the P29474 activity ( p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSION : LUT seems to have an effective role in reducing the seizure frequency and a protective role on peripheral organ injury in animal models of seizure . The protective effect of LUT in seizures and the seizure induced peripheral tissue damage warrant further investigations . The protective effect of rebamipide on paracellular permeability of rat gastric epithelial cells . BACKGROUND : Barrier function in gastric epithelial cells is essential for the gastric defence mechanism against acid back-diffusion into the mucosal layer . Our previous study indicated that trans-epithelial resistance ( Q9NZ01 ) of rat gastric epithelial cells was rapidly increased when the cells were exposed to acid . This response to acid was diminished by indometacin . AIM : Evaluate the effects of a mucoprotective agent , rebamipide , on the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) -induced increase of gastric epithelial permeability . METHODS : Rat gastric epithelial cells were plated on tissue culture inserts . Cells were exposed to a NSAID ( indometacin , 10-7 M ) . Trans-epithelial permeability was measured by Q9NZ01 and diffusion rate of 14C-mannitol . The effect of rebamipide was evaluated by measuring Q9NZ01 . Endogenous prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) production in culture medium was also measured . RESULTS : DB00328 gradually and significantly decreased Q9NZ01 and increased 14C-manitol permeability . Rebamipide reversed the indometacin-induced changes in epithelial permeability and induced DB00917 synthesis . This induction was blocked by either indometacin or a Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 specific inhibitor . CONCLUSIONS : P36551 inhibitors such as indometacin inhibit regulation of epithelial permeability by reducing DB00917 . P23219 has an important role in the gastric defense mechanism . Rebamipide suppressed an indometacin-induced increase in gastric epithelial permeability by increasing DB00917 levels in a P35354 dependent manner . Synthesis , biological activity and HPLC validation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine derivatives as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . The synthesis and biochemical evaluation of new hybrids of tacrine ( DB00382 ) and 4-fluorobenzoic acid ( 4-FBA ) possessing activity towards acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) and butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) inhibition are presented . The compounds of interest were obtained from the reaction of activated 4-FBA and diamino derivatives of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine . The compounds P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -4KW/HCl and P13671 -3KW/HCl have four-fold higher antiacetylcholinesterase activity than DB00382 . All of the acquired compounds present higher selectivity towards P22303 than DB00382 and lower selectivity towards BuChE . In addition , a rapid , selective and stability-indicating HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl . DB00382 and 4-FBA were found to be the main impurities . Chromatographic separation was achieved isocratically on a Waters Symmetry C18 150 × 3.9 mm , 4 μm column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/buffer ( 17 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate and 8.3 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate , 50:50 v/v ) ( overall pH 4 ) . A 1.5 ml/min flow rate and a 247 nm wavelength were chosen for this method . P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl were subjected to acidic and basic hydrolysis , chemical oxidation , thermal exposition at 60 °C and intense UV light . The limits of detection ( LOD ) and quantification ( LOQ ) were less than 2 μg/ml and 6 μg/ml for P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl , 0.04 μg/ml and 0.12 μg/ml for DB00382 , 0.42 μg/ml and 1.41 μg/ml for 4-FBA , respectively . A novel mutation in P30518 causing congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with complete resistance to antidiuretic hormone . A 6-month-old male infant presented with failure to thrive . Hypernatraemia and elevated serum osmolality in the presence of low urine sodium and osmolality led to the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus . Administration of DB00035 ( dDAVP ) neither decreased urine volume nor increased urine osmolality indicating congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus . Molecular analysis in the arginine-vasopressin receptor-2 gene ( P30518 ) located on chromosome Xq28 demonstrated a novel 5-base pair deletion ( c.962-966delACCCC ; g.1429-1433delACCCC ) leading to a shift of the reading frame ( p.Asn321fs ) and a premature termination codon implying an absent or non-functional protein . Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide , amiloride and indomethacin led to a favourable clinical course . DB00067 triggers senescence in K-ras transformed cells via RhoA-dependent downregulation of cyclin D1 . DB00067 ( AVP ) , a vasoactive peptide hormone that binds to three G-protein coupled receptors ( V1R , P30518 , and V3R ) , has long been known to activate V1R and elicit mitogenesis in several cell types , including adrenal glomerulosa cells . However , in the mouse Q03519 adrenocortical malignant cell line , AVP triggers not only a canonical mitogenic response but also novel RhoA-GTP-dependent mechanisms which downregulate cyclin D1 , irreversibly inhibiting K-ras oncogene-driven proliferation . In Q03519 cells , AVP blocks cyclin D1 expression , induces senescence-associated beta-galactosidase ( SAbeta-Gal ) and inhibits proliferation . However , ectopic expression of cyclin D1 renders Q03519 cells resistant to both SAbeta-Gal induction and proliferation inhibition by AVP . In addition , ectopic expression of the dominant negative RhoAN19 mutant blocks RhoA activation , yielding Q03519 cell sub-lines which are no longer susceptible to cyclin D1 downregulation , SAbeta-Gal induction , or proliferation inhibition by AVP . Furthermore , inhibiting RhoA with P01024 exoenzyme protects Q03519 cells from AVP proliferation inhibition and SAbeta-Gal induction . On the other hand , AVP treatment does not activate caspases 3 and 7 , and the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CMK does not protect Q03519 cells from proliferation inhibition by AVP , implying that AVP does not trigger apoptosis . These results underline a pivotal survival activity of cyclin D1 that protects K-ras oncogene-dependent malignant cells from senescence . Ectopic DB01285 syndrome caused by bronchial carcinoid tumor indistinguishable from Cushing 's disease . A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of a poor glycemic control . She was found to have Cushingoid feature and dynamic endocrine tests showed elevated plasma DB01285 and cortisol levels , lack of their circadian rhythm , non-suppressibility to high-dose dexamethasone , responsiveness to P06850 , but not to DB00035 , and suppression to octreotide . Pituitary Q9BWK5 showed an equivocal small lesion . CT scan of the chest showed two nodular lesions in the right lung ( S5 , S7 ) , while a mild uptake was noted only in S5 lesion by DB09150 -PET , but positive uptake was only in S7 lesion by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy ( SRS ) . Inferior petrosal sinus sampling revealed a gradient of plasma DB01285 after P06850 stimulation , consistent with the diagnosis of Cushing ' s disease . She underwent middle and inferior lobectomy of the right lung . The resected tumor in S7 was consistent with the diagnosis of a bronchial carcinoid tumor with positive DB01285 immunoreactivity , while that of S5 was cryptococcal granuloma . RT-PCR revealed abundant expressions of P01189 and SSTR ( -1 , -2 , -5 ) , but not of P34998 and P47901 . Postoperatively , abnormal endocrine data were normalized along with improvement of hypertension and diabetes . This was a diagnostic challenging case with ectopic DB01285 syndrome indistinguishable from Cushing ' s disease by various endocrine and imaging tests , among which SRS successfully localized the tumor responsible for ectopic DB01285 secretion . Determination of cobimetinib in human plasma using protein precipitation extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry . Inhibition of Q96HU1 / P29323 kinase ( MEK ) is a promising strategy to control the growth of tumors that are dependent on aberrant signaling in the MEK pathway . DB05239 ( P16260 -0973 ) ( S ) -[3,4-Difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodo-phenylamino)-phenyl]- ( ( S ) -3-hydroxy-3-piperidin-2-yl-azetidin-1-yl ) -methanone ) inhibits proliferation of a variety of human tumor cell lines by inhibiting Q02750 and P36507 . A specific high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric assay was developed and validated for the determination of cobimetinib in human plasma . The overall mean recovery using protein precipitation extraction with acetonitrile was found to be 54.1 % . The calibration curve was ranged from 0.20 to 100ng/mL . The LLOQ was sensitive enough to detect terminal phase concentrations of the drug . The intra- and inter-assay precision ( % CV ) was within 10.3 % and 9.5 % for cobimetinib . The assay accuracy ( % RE ) was within ±13.7 % of the nominal concentration values for cobimetinib with the normal analytical QCs . The developed assay was successfully used to analyze the human plasma samples ( for pharmacokinetic analysis ) from clinical trials . Differential actions of vasopeptidase inhibition versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on diuretic therapy in experimental congestive heart failure . BACKGROUND : DB00886 ( OMA ) , a vasopeptidase inhibitor , simultaneously inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) and neutral endopeptidase , which degrades vasodilatory factors ( eg , P35318 ) and natriuretic peptides . Based on the beneficial cardiorenal and humoral properties of the natriuretic peptides , we hypothesized that an acute vasopeptidase inhibitor with or without diuretic would result in more favorable cardiorenal and hormonal actions than P12821 inhibition plus diuretic ( ACEI+D ) in congestive heart failure . METHODS AND RESULTS : We compared the actions of OMA alone and with diuretic ( OMA+D ) to ACEI+D in a model of pacing-induced congestive heart failure . OMA+D decreased pulmonary arterial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures to a greater level than OMA alone or ACEI+D . Glomerular filtration rate was lower with ACEI+D than with either OMA group . Plasma renin activity and aldosterone immediately increased with ACEI+D , whereas OMA+D resulted in higher plasma renin activity and a delayed increase in aldosterone . OMA alone did not increase plasma renin activity and aldosterone , but resulted in a sustained increase in plasma adrenomedullin , with higher urinary atrial natriuretic peptide , adrenomedullin , and cGMP excretions than with ACEI+D . CONCLUSIONS : Acute administration of OMA with or without diuretic results in more favorable cardiorenal and humoral responses in experimental congestive heart failure than does ACEI+D . There is no acute activation of renin and aldosterone with OMA alone such as occurs with ACEI+D and OMA+D . Thus , OMA with or without a diuretic possesses beneficial cardiorenal and humoral actions comparable to those observed with ACEI+D that can be explained by potentiation of natriuretic peptides . Desmopressin ( DB00035 ) induces NO production in human endothelial cells via V2 receptor- and DB02527 -mediated signaling . The hemostatic agent desmopressin ( DB00035 ) also has strong vasodilatory effects . DB00035 is a selective agonist for the vasopressin V2 receptor ( P30518 ) , which is coupled to DB02527 -dependent signaling . DB00035 -induced vasodilation may be due to endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) activation . This hypothesis implies DB02527 -mediated P29474 activation . It also implies wide extrarenal , endothelial P30518 expression . We show that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) the DB02527 -raising agents forskolin and epinephrine increase NO production , as measured by a l-NMMA-inhibitable rise in cellular cGMP content . They also increase P29474 enzymatic activity , in a partly calcium-independent manner . DB02527 -mediated P29474 activation is associated with phosphorylation of residue Ser1177 , in a phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -independent manner . HUVECs do not express P30518 . However , after heterologous P30518 expression , DB00035 induces DB02527 -dependent P29474 activation via Ser1177 phosphorylation . We have previously found P30518 expression in cultured lung endothelial cells . By real time quantitative RT-PCR , we now find a wide P30518 distribution notably in heart , lung and skeletal muscle . These results indicate that DB00035 and other DB02527 -raising agents can activate P29474 via PI3K-independent Ser1177 phosphorylation in human endothelial cells . This mechanism most likely accounts for DB00035 -induced vasodilation . Correlation between tumor volume response to radiotherapy and expression of biological markers in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma . OBJECTIVE : To determine the factors associated with tumor volume response to radiotherapy ( RT ) in cervical cancer patients , and the relationship between the tumor volume response and alteration of the expression of biological markers during RT . METHODS : Twenty consecutive patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma who received definitive RT were enrolled . Tumor volumes were calculated by Q9BWK5 examinations performed at the start of RT ( pre-RT ) , at the fourth week of RT ( mid-RT ) , and 1 month after RT completion ( post-RT ) . Two serial punch biopsies were performed at pre- and mid-RT , and immunohistochemical staining was performed for cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 and epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) . RESULTS : For the pre-RT evaluation , fourteen ( 70 % ) and eleven ( 55 % ) patients showed positive immunoreactivity for P35354 and P00533 , respectively . Among the seven patients whose median percentage residual tumor at mid-RT ( P30518 ) was greater than 0.5 , seven ( 100 % , p=0.0515 ) and five ( 71.4 % , p=0.3742 ) patients showed positive immunoreactivity for P35354 and P00533 , respectively . The logistic regression analysis showed that positive immunoreactivity for both P35354 and P00533 at pre-RT were associated with P30518 ( p=0.0782 ) . For the mid-RT evaluation , eight cases showed an interval increase in the distribution of immunoreactivity for P35354 , and six out of the eight patients had a P30518 greater than 0.5 ( p=0.2222 ) . CONCLUSION : The poor mid-RT tumor response was associated with the coexpression of P35354 and P00533 . Preparation of phosphorylated starch by dry-heating in the presence of pyrophosphate and its calcium-phosphate solubilizing ability . Starch was phosphorylated through dry-heating in the presence of pyrophosphate at various conditions , and the characteristics of phosphorylated starch ( PS ) were examined . Starch phosphorylation increases as the pH increases from 3 to 6 , but diminishes at pH 7 . Increased temperatures enhance phosphorylation . Data from (31)P NMR suggests that starch phosphorylation occurs mainly at the P01024 -OH and P13671 -OH of the glucose residue . The phosphate linkage is mainly due to monostarch monophosphate . Although starch had almost no calcium phosphate-solubilising capacity , this capacity was markedly enhanced by phosphorylation . X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the crystal structure of hydroxyapatite was not present in the calcium phosphate-PS complex . Loss of Jak2 impairs endothelial function by attenuating P04049 / Q02750 /Sp-1 signaling along with altered P29474 activities . A number of inhibitors have been used to dissect the functional relevance of Jak2 in endothelial homeostasis , with disparate results . Given that Jak2 deficiency leads to embryonic lethality , the exact role of Jak2 in the regulation of postnatal endothelial function is yet to be fully elucidated . We generated a model in which Jak2 deficiency can be induced by tamoxifen in adult mice . Loss of Jak2 significantly impaired endothelium-dependent response capacity for vasodilators . Matrigel plug assays indicated a notable decrease in endothelial angiogenic function in Jak2-deficient mice . Studies in a hindlimb ischemic model indicated that Jak2 activity is likely to be a prerequisite for prompt perfusion recovery , based on the concordance of temporal changes in Jak2 expression during the course of ischemic injury and perfusion recovery . A remarkable delay in perfusion recovery , along with reduced capillary and arteriole formation , was observed in Jak2-deficient mice . Antibody array studies indicated that loss of Jak2 led to repressed P29474 expression . In mechanistic studies , Jak2 deficiency attenuated P04049 / Q02750 signaling , which then reduced activity of Sp-1 , an essential transcription factor responsible for P29474 expression . These data are important not only for understanding the exact role that Jak2 plays in endothelial homeostasis , but also for assessing Jak2-based therapeutic strategies in a variety of clinical settings . Mechanisms for epigallocatechin gallate induced inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes in rat liver microsomes . DB03823 gallate ( EGCG ) inhibits drug metabolizing enzymes by unknown mechanisms . Here we examined if the inhibition is due to covalent-binding of EGCG to the enzymes or formation of protein aggregates . EGCG was incubated with rat liver microsomes at 1-100μM for 30min . The EGCG-binding proteins were affinity purified using m-aminophenylboronic acid agarose and probed with antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( P04406 ) , actin , cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 1A1 , P05177 , CYP2B1/2 , P05181 , CYP3A , catechol-O-methyltransferase ( P21964 ) and microsomal glutathione transferase 1 ( P10620 ) . All but actin and soluble P21964 were positively detected at ≥1μM EGCG , indicating EGCG selectively bound to a subset of proteins including membrane-bound P21964 . The binding correlated well with inhibition of CYP activities , except for P05181 whose activity was unaffected despite evident binding . The antioxidant enzyme P10620 , but not cytosolic GSTs , was remarkably inhibited , providing novel evidence supporting the pro-oxidative effects of EGCG . When microsomes incubated with EGCG were probed on Western blots , all but the actin and P05181 antibodies showed a significant reduction in binding at ≥1μM EGCG , suggesting that a fraction of the indicated proteins formed aggregates that likely contributed to the inhibitory effects of EGCG but were not recognizable by antibodies against the intact proteins . This raised the possibility that previous reports on EGCG regulating protein expression using P04406 as a reference should be revisited for accuracy . Remarkable protein aggregate formation in EGCG-treated microsomes was also observed by analyzing Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels . EGCG effects were partially abolished in the presence of 1mM glutathione , suggesting they are particularly relevant to the in vivo conditions when glutathione is depleted by toxicant insults . Absolute bioavailability and effect of formulation change , food , or elevated pH with rabeprazole on cobimetinib absorption in healthy subjects . DB05239 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of Q02750 /2 . Since cobimetinib exhibited absorption variability in cancer patients , a series of single-dose studies in healthy subjects were conducted to determine absolute bioavailability and elucidate potential effects of formulation , food , and elevated gastric pH on cobimetinib bioavailability . Three crossover trials were performed with a 20 mg cobimetinib oral dose : absolute bioavailability using a 2 mg intravenous infusion ( n = 13 ) , relative bioavailability of tablets versus capsules and food effect ( n = 20 ) , and drug interaction with a proton pump inhibitor ( 20 mg of rabeprazole daily for 5 days prior to cobimetinib administration ; n = 20 ) . Absolute bioavailability of cobimetinib was 46.2 % ( 24.2 , CV % ) , likely due to metabolism rather than incomplete absorption . The mean systemic clearance of cobimetinib was low ( 11.7 L/h [ 28.2 , CV % ] ) . Administration of cobimetinib tablets with a high-fat meal delayed drug absorption ( prolonged tmax ) but had no statistically significant effect on cobimetinib exposure ( Cmax and AUC0-∞ ) . Tablet and capsule formulations of cobimetinib showed comparable exposures . DB05239 exhibited delayed absorption ( tmax ) in the presence of rabeprazole , with no statistically significant effects on drug exposure ( Cmax and AUC0-∞ ) in the fasted state . In conclusion , cobimetinib oral absorption was not affected by change in formulation , food , or elevated gastric pH . Effects of retinol binding protein-4 on vascular endothelial cells . The study was designed to investigate the effect of retinol binding protein ( P02753 ) -4 on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways , which mediate the effects of insulin in vascular endothelial cells . The effects of P02753 on nitric oxide ( NO ) and insulin-stimulated endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) secretion and on phosphorylation ( p ) of Akt , endothelial NO synthetase ( P29474 ) , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 were investigated in bovine vascular aortic endothelial cells ( BAECs ) . P02753 showed an acute vasodilatatory effect on aortic rings of rats within a few minutes . In BAECs , P02753 -treatment for 5min significantly increased NO production , but inhibited insulin-stimulated ET-1 secretion . P02753 -induced NO production was not inhibited by tetraacetoxymethylester ( BAPTA-AM ) , an intracellular calcium chelator , but was completely abolished by wortmannin , a PI3K inhibitor . P02753 significantly increased p-Akt and p- P29474 production , and significantly inhibited p- P27361 /2 production . Triciribine , an Akt inhibitor , and wortmannin significantly inhibited P02753 -induced p-Akt and p- P29474 production . Inhibition of Akt1 by small interfering RNA decreased p- P29474 production enhanced by P02753 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . In conclusion , P02753 has a robust acute effect of enhancement of NO production via stimulation of part of the PI3K/Akt/ P29474 pathway and inhibition of P27361 /2 phosphorylation and insulin-induced ET-1 secretion , probably in the MAPK pathway , which results in vasodilatation . Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus in China . BACKGROUND : Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ( PNDM ) is a rare disease , which is defined as the onset of diabetes before the age of 6 months with persistence through life . Infants with Q14654 or Q09428 genetic mutations may respond to oral sulfonylurea therapy . Currently , there are limited studies about the genetic analysis and long-term follow-up of PNDM . CASE PRESENTATION : We report four cases of PNDM . None of the infants or their parents had P01308 , Q14654 , or Q09428 genetic mutations . One infant underwent continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) and the other infants underwent multiple injections of insulin ( MII ) . In these infants , PNDM persisted from 35 months to 60 months of follow-up . Three infants maintained fairly stable blood sugar levels , and one infant had poor sugar control . CONCLUSIONS : We suggest that all of the infants with PNDM should undergo genetic evaluation . For infants without Q14654 and Q09428 genetic mutations , oral sulfonylurea should not be considered as treatment . CSII is a useful method for overcoming the difficulties of diabetes , and it may also improve the quality of life of both infants and their parents . Functional characterization of vasopressin receptor 2 mutations causing partial and complete congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in Thai families . BACKGROUND : P30518 mutations cause most cases of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) ; 211 P30518 mutations have been described , but only 7 are described causing partial NDI . METHODS : Two unrelated Thai boys had polyuria and polydipsia in infancy but had normal electrolytes and serum osmolality at 2 years of age . Patient 1 could not concentrate his urine in response to water deprivation or 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin ( DB00035 ) ; patient 2 could concentrate to approximately 600 mosm/l . The patients ' P30518 genes were sequenced and the identified mutations were re-created in P30518 cDNA expression vectors . P30518 activities were measured by stimulating transfected HEK293T cells with arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) or DB00035 , and assessing the resulting DB02527 production by the activation of a luciferase reporter . RESULTS : Patient 1 carried the previously described missense mutation R181C ; patient 2 carried the novel missense mutation M311V . When transiently transfected into HEK293T cells , 6.8 x 10(-12) M AVP induced the half-maximal response ( EC50 ) of the wild-type , whereas the EC50 value for R181C was 5.9 x 10(-9) M and for M311V was 2.6 x 10(-10)M . Responses to DB00035 were qualitatively similar but required 10-fold higher concentrations . CONCLUSION : The novel P30518 mutation M311V retains partial activity and results in a milder form of NDI . Lipoxygenase pathway mediates increases of airway resistance and lung inflation induced by exposure to nanotitanium dioxide in rats . Nanotitanium dioxide particle ( nTiO2 ) inhalation has been reported to induce lung parenchymal injury . After inhalation of nTiO2 , we monitored changes in P09917 , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) mRNA in rat lung tissue . Lung function parameters include specific airway resistance ( SRaw ) , peak expiratory flow rate ( PEF ) , functional residual capacity ( FRC ) , and lung compliance ( Cchord ) ; blood white blood cell count ( WBC ) , nitric oxide ( NO ) , hydrogen peroxide , and lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ; and lung lavage leukotriene C4 , interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) , tumor necrotic factor α ( TNFα ) , hydroxyl radicals , and NO . Leukotriene receptor antagonist MK571 and P09917 inhibitor MK886 were used for pharmacologic intervention . Compared to control , nTiO2 exposure induced near 5-fold increase in P09917 mRNA expression in lung tissue . P35228 mRNA increased while P29474 mRNA decreased . Lavage leukotriene C4 ; P05231 ; TNFα ; NO ; hydroxyl radicals ; and blood WBC , NO , hydrogen peroxide , and LDH levels rose . Obstructive ventilatory insufficiency was observed . MK571 and MK886 both attenuated the systemic inflammation and lung function changes . We conclude that inhaled nTiO2 induces systemic inflammation , cytokine release , and oxidative and nitrosative stress in the lung . The lipoxygenase pathway products , mediated by oxygen radicals and WBC , play a critical role in the obstructive ventilatory insufficiency induced by nTiO2 . Mapping of an ordered set of 14 cosmids to human chromosome 12p by two-color in situ hybridization . To map human chromosome 12p aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) , cosmids were isolated or obtained for 14 known 12p loci ( D12S119 , D12S158 , D12S178 , P36941 , D12S380E , P01023 , Q13936 , P10767 , P04406 , P01116 , P04280 , P20742 , P60174 , and P04275 ) . Using two-color Q5TCZ1 with three labeled probes to interphase nuclei , and to prometaphase chromosomes where possible , the order of these loci was sequentially determined to be pter-D12S158-D12S380E- Q13936 - P10767 - P36941 - P04275 - P04406 - P60174 - P01023 - P20742 - P04280 -D12S 178-D12S119- P01116 -cen . Two cell lines were analyzed with this set of cosmids . The EBV-transformed cell line TA carries a der(12) with a deletion of bands 12p13.1 --> p11.2.D12S178 , D12S119 , and P01116 were absent in the der(12) , whereas the other loci were present . The second cell line , GM01203A , exhibits a balanced t(4;12) ( 4q25 ; 12p13.3 ) with a breakpoint between P10767 and P36941 . Antiproliferative effect of DB00035 analogs on human breast cancer cells . BACKGROUND : Desmopressin ( dDAVP ) , a synthetic nonapeptide derivative of arginine vasopressin , is a safe antidiuretic and hemostatic compound that acts as a selective agonist for the vasopressin V2 membrane receptor ( P30518 ) . It is known that dDAVP can inhibit progression of residual metastatic cells in preclinical models . Among other mechanisms , the compound induces an agonist effect on P30518 present in tumor cells . RESULTS/DISCUSSION : Looking for novel analogs with improved anti-tumor activity , positions 4 and 5 , at the conformational peptide loop , were substituted . The analog [V(4)Q(5)]dDAVP ( [ 4-valine 5-glutamine ] desmopressin ) exhibited a significantly higher antiproliferative effect than dDAVP in cultures of MCF-7 , a P30518 -expressing human breast carcinoma cell line . The chiral isomer of this analog and tetrapeptide fragments corresponding to the loop region were also assessed . CONCLUSION : Preclinical evaluation of the anti-tumor activity of [V(4)Q(5)]dDAVP in animal models is warranted . Mass spectrometry and hydrogen/deuterium exchange measurements of alcohol-induced structural changes in cellular retinol-binding protein type I . To bind and release its ligand , cellular retinol-binding protein type I ( P09455 ) needs to undergo conformational and dynamic changes to connect the inner , solvent-shielded cavity , where retinol is found to bind , and the outside medium . DB00162 dissociation in vitro is favoured by water/alcohol mixtures whose moderately low dielectric constants mimic a property characteristic of the membrane microenvironment where this process occurs in vivo . Apo- and holo- P09455 , in either water/methanol or water/trifluoroethanol ( TFE ) mixtures , were analyzed at equilibrium by electrospray ionization with orthogonal quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( P19957 -Q-TOFMS ) to identify the alcohol-induced species . The questions were asked whether the presence of alcohols affects protein dynamics , as reflected by hydrogen/deuterium ( H/D ) exchange monitored by continuous-labelling experiments , and to which extent retinol dissociation influences the process . With increasing methanol , at pH near neutrality , apo- P09455 exhibits a progressively more compact conformation , resulting in reduced H/D exchange with respect to the native protein in water . DB00162 dissociation from the holo-protein did not promote hydrogen replacement . Similarly , in the presence of the low TFE concentration sufficient to cause retinol dissociation , the hydrogen exchange of the resulting apo-protein was not exalted . However , in contrast with the alkanol , higher TFE concentrations induced a transition of apo- P09455 to a new alpha-helix conformation capable of exchanging all available hydrogen atoms . Therapy with a synthetic retinoid -- ( Ro 10-1670 ) etretin -- increases the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein in nonlesional psoriatic skin . Cellular retinol ( P09455 ) -and retinoic acid ( CRABP ) -binding proteins were determined in samples of lesional and nonlesional skin of psoriatic patients , before and during oral administration of a synthetic retinoid , DB00459 ( Ro 10-1670 ) . A 200 % increase in CRABP levels , measured by the ability of the protein to bind retinoic acid , was observed in the normal skin during treatment . The P09455 levels were not altered during therapy . The results show that P09455 and CRABP are independently regulated in human skin and suggest that synthetic retinoids may exert their pharmacologic effects by interfering with the regulation of natural retinoic acid receptors . Acute diabetes insipidus mediated by vasopressinase after placental abruption . CONTEXT : Postpartum , diabetes insipidus ( DI ) can be part of Sheehan 's syndrome or lymphocytic hypophysitis in combination with anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies . In contrast , acute onset of isolated DI in the postpartum period is unusual . CASE PRESENTATION : This patient presented at 33 weeks gestation with placental abruption , prompting a cesarean delivery of twins . Immediately after delivery , she developed severe DI . The DI could be controlled with the vasopressinase-resistant DB00035 ( DB00035 ) , but not with arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) , and it resolved within a few weeks . OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to demonstrate that the postpartum DI in this patient was caused by the release of placental vasopressinase into the maternal bloodstream . METHODS AND RESULTS : Cells were transiently transfected with the AVP receptor 2 ( P30518 ) and treated with either AVP or DB00035 in the presence of the patient 's serum collected postpartum or 10 weeks after delivery . The response to the different treatments was evaluated by measuring the activity of a DB02527 -responsive firefly luciferase reporter construct . The in vitro studies demonstrate that the patient 's postpartum serum disrupts activation of the P30518 by AVP , but not by the vasopressinase-resistant DB00035 . CONCLUSIONS : Placental abruption can rarely be associated with acute postpartum DI caused by release of placental vasopressinase into the bloodstream . This clinical entity must be considered in patients with placental abruption and when evaluating patients presenting with DI after delivery . Identification , characterization and rescue of a novel vasopressin-2 receptor mutation causing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus . OBJECTIVE : X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( XNDI ) , caused by mutations in the V2 vasopressin receptor ( P30518 ) , is clinically distinguished from central diabetes insipidus ( CDI ) by elevated serum vasopressin ( AVP ) levels and unresponsiveness to 1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin ( DB00035 ) . We report two infants with XNDI , and present the characterization and functional rescue of a novel P30518 mutation . PATIENTS : Two male infants presented with poor growth and hypernatraemia . Both patients had measurable pretreatment serum AVP and polyuria that did not respond to DB00035 , suggesting NDI . However , both also had absent posterior pituitary bright spot on Q9BWK5 , which is a finding more typical of CDI . METHODS : The P30518 gene encoding P30518 was sequenced . The identified novel missense mutation was re-created by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in HEK293 cells . P30518 activity was assessed by the ability of transfected cells to produce DB02527 in response to stimulation with DB00035 . Membrane localization of P30518 was assessed by fluorescence microscopy . RESULTS : Patient 1 had a deletion of P30518 ; patient 2 had the novel mutation L57R . In transiently transfected HEK293 cells , DB00035 induced detectable but severely impaired L57R P30518 activity compared to cells expressing wild-type P30518 . Fluorescence microscopy showed that myc-tagged wild-type P30518 localized to the cell membrane while L57R P30518 remained intracellular . A nonpeptide P30518 chaperone , SR121463 , partially rescued L57R P30518 function by allowing it to reach the cell membrane . CONCLUSIONS : L57R P30518 has impaired in vitro activity that can be partially improved by treatment with a P30518 chaperone . The posterior pituitary hyperintensity may be absent in infants with XNDI . DB01017 inhibits P09917 activation and brain inflammation after focal cerebral ischemia in rats . AIM : To determine whether the anti-inflammatory effect of minocycline on postischemic brain injury is mediated by the inhibition of P09917 ( 5- P28300 ) expression and enzymatic activation in rats . METHODS : Focal cerebral ischemia was induced for 30 min with middle cerebral artery occlusion , followed by reperfusion . The ischemic injuries , endogenous IgG exudation , the accumulation of neutrophils and macrophage/microglia , and 5- P28300 mRNA expression were determined 72 h after reperfusion . 5- P28300 metabolites ( leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes ) were measured 3 h after reperfusion . RESULTS : DB01017 ( 22.5 and 45 mg/kg , ip , for 3 d ) attenuated ischemic injuries , IgG exudation , and the accumulation of neutrophils and macrophage/microglia 72 h after reperfusion . It also inhibited 5- P28300 expression 72 h after reperfusion and the production of leukotrienes 3 h after reperfusion . CONCLUSION : DB01017 inhibited postischemic brain inflammation , which might be partly mediated by the inhibition of 5- P28300 expression and enzymatic activation . Urinary pheromones promote P29323 /Akt phosphorylation , regeneration and survival of vomeronasal ( P30518 ) neurons . The G protein-coupled pheromone receptor neurons ( V1R and P30518 ) of the vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) are continually replaced throughout the lifetime of the mouse . Moreover , active signalling of V2Rs via the transient receptor potential 2(TRPC2) channel is necessary for regeneration of receptors , as the TRPC2 null mutant mouse showed a 75 % reduction of V2Rs by the age of two months . Here we describe P30518 mediated signalling in a neuronal line established from vomeronasal stem cells taken from postnatal female mice . Cells were immunoreactive for Galpha(o) and P30518 , whereas V1R and Galpha(i) immunoreactivity could not be detected . Biological ligands ( dilute urine and its protein fractions ) were found to increase proliferation and survival of these neurons . Dilute mouse urine but not artificial urine also induced P29323 , Akt and CREB signalling in a dose dependent way . The volatile fraction of male mouse urine alone was without effect while the fraction containing peptides ( > 5 kDa ) also stimulated P29323 and Akt phosphorylation . The P29323 , Akt and CREB phosphorylation response was sensitive to pertussis toxin , confirming the involvement of P30518 linked Galpha(o) . Dilute mouse urine or its high molecular weight protein fraction increased survival and proliferation of these neurons . Hence , urinary pheromones , which signal important social information via mature neurons , also promote survival and proliferation of their regenerating precursors . These data show that regenerating V2Rs respond to urine and the urinary peptides by activation of the Ras- P29323 and P19957 -Akt pathways , which appear to be important for vomeronasal neural survival and proliferation . Expression of cytosolic retinoid-binding protein genes in human skin biopsies and cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts . Using reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction we have studied the mRNA expression of serum retinol-binding protein and cytosolic receptors for retinol and retinoic acid in skin biopsies , and in cultured epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts . Transcripts for cellular retinol-binding protein ( P09455 ) I and cellular retinoic-acid-binding protein ( CRABP ) I were found in normal skin , keratinocytes , and fibroblasts . CRABP II transcripts were detected in skin and keratinocytes . A decreased mRNA expression of CRABP I and an increased mRNA expression of CRABP II were found in lesional psoriatic skin compared with uninvolved skin . mRNA transcripts for serum retinol-binding protein ( s- P02753 ) were detected in all tissues and cells . The biological importance of s- P02753 expression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts is not known , but hypothetically this protein may be involved in the intracellular shuttling of retinol and retinoic acid , or in the retransportation of cellular retinoids into the extracellular space . Adrenomedullin- O60895 system is crucially involved in retinal angiogenesis . Adrenomedullin ( P35318 ) is an endogenous peptide first identified as a strong vasodilating molecule . We previously showed that in mice , homozygous knockout of P35318 ( P35318 (-/-) ) or its receptor regulating protein , O60895 ( O60895 (-/-) ) , is embryonically lethal due to abnormal vascular development , thereby demonstrating the importance of P35318 and its receptor signaling to vascular development . P35318 expression in the retina is strongly induced by ischemia ; however , its role in retinal pathophysiology remains unknown . Here , we analyzed oxygen-induced retinopathy ( OIR ) using heterozygous P35318 and O60895 knockout mice models ( P35318 (+/-) or O60895 (+/-) , respectively ) . In addition , we analyzed the role of the P35318 - O60895 system during earlier stages of retinal angiogenesis using an inducible endothelial cell-specific O60895 knockout mouse line ( DI-E- O60895 (-/-) ) . Finally , we assessed the ability of antibody-induced P35318 blockade to control pathological retinal angiogenesis in OIR . In OIR , neovascular tufts , avascular zones , and hypoxic areas were all smaller in P35318 (+/-) retinas compared with wild-type mice . P35318 (+/-) retinas also exhibited reduced levels of P15692 and P29474 expression . DI-E- O60895 (-/-) showed abnormal retinal vascular patterns in the early stages of development . However , P35318 enhanced the proliferation and migration of retinal endothelial cells . Finally , we found intravitreal injection of anti- P35318 antibody reduced pathological retinal angiogenesis . In conclusion , the P35318 - O60895 system is crucially involved in retinal angiogenesis . P35318 and its receptor system are potential therapeutic targets for controlling pathological retinal angiogenesis . The Drosophila insulin receptor activates multiple signaling pathways but requires insulin receptor substrate proteins for DNA synthesis . The Drosophila insulin receptor ( P30518 ) contains a 368-amino-acid COOH-terminal extension that contains several tyrosine phosphorylation sites in YXXM motifs . This extension is absent from the human insulin receptor but resembles a region in insulin receptor substrate ( P41252 ) proteins which binds to the phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 3-kinase and mediates mitogenesis . The function of a chimeric P30518 containing the human insulin receptor binding domain ( hDIR ) was investigated in 32D cells , which contain few insulin receptors and no P41252 proteins . P01308 stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation of the human insulin receptor and hDIR , and both receptors mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase . P35568 was required by the human insulin receptor to activate PI 3-kinase and p70s6k , whereas hDIR associated with PI 3-kinase and activated p70s6k without P35568 . However , both receptors required P35568 to mediate insulin-stimulated mitogenesis . These data demonstrate that the P30518 possesses additional signaling capabilities compared with its mammalian counterpart but still requires P35568 for the complete insulin response in mammalian cells . Hypoxia-induced neuroinflammatory white-matter injury reduced by minocycline in SHR/SP . Hypertensive small vessel disease is a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment ( VCI ) . Spontaneously hypertensive/stroke prone rats ( SHR/SP ) with unilateral carotid artery occlusion ( UCAO ) and a Japanese permissive diet ( JPD ) have white-matter ( WM ) damage similar to that seen in VCI . We hypothesized that WM injury was due to hypoxia-mediated , blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) disruption . Twelve-week-old SHR/SP had UCAO/JPD and were studied with immunohistochemistry , biochemistry , multimodal magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) , and Morris water maze ( MWM ) testing . One week after UCAO/JPD , WM showed a significant increase in hypoxia inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) , which increased further by 3 weeks . Prolyl hydroxylase-2 ( Q9GZT9 ) expression decreased at 1 and 3 weeks . Infiltrating T cells and neutrophils appeared around endothelial cells from 1 to 3 weeks after UCAO/JPD , and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) colocalized with inflammatory cells . At 3 weeks , WM immunostained for IgG , indicating BBB leakage . DB01017 ( 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally ) was given every other day from weeks 12 to 20 . Multimodal Q9BWK5 showed that treatment with minocycline significantly reduced lesion size and improved cerebral blood flow . DB01017 improved performance in the MWM and prolonged survival . We propose that BBB disruption occurred secondary to hypoxia , which induced an P14780 -mediated infiltration of leukocytes . DB01017 significantly reduced WM damage , improved behavior , and prolonged life . The P08908 -receptor agonist flibanserin reduces drug-induced dyskinesia in O75916 -deficient mice . Drug-induced dyskinesia is a major complication of dopamine replacement therapy in advanced Parkinson 's disease consisting of dystonia , chorea and athetosis . Agonists at P08908 -receptors attenuate levodopa-induced motor complications in non-human primates . Mice with increased dopamine D2 receptor ( P14416 ) signalling due to the lack of expression of the regulator of G-protein signalling 9 ( O75916 ) also develop dyskinesia following levodopa treatment . We investigated whether the P08908 -receptor agonist flibanserin compared with buspirone reduces motor abnormalities induced by levodopa or quinelorane , a selective dopamine D2-receptor agonist . Following dopamine depletion via reserpine , 40 mice ( 20 wild-type and 20 O75916 knock-out ) were treated with flibanserin or buspirone in combination with levodopa or quinelorane . Motor behaviour was analysed using open field analysis . O75916 knock-out mice displayed significantly more drug-induced dystonia ( p < 0.04 ; t test ) than wild type . In quinelorane-treated wild-type mice flibanserin as well as buspirone significantly reduced dystonia ( p < 0.05 ) . In O75916 knock-out animals again both reduced quinelorane-induced dystonia . However , flibanserin was significantly more effective ( p = 0.003 ) . Following reserpine pretreatment and administration of levodopa wild-type and Q99697 9 knock-out mice showed mild to moderate dystonia . Surprisingly , 10 mg/kg buspirone increased dystonia in both animal groups , whereas it was decreased by 10 mg/kg flibanserin . However , compared with levodopa alone only the increase of dystonia by buspirone was significant ( p < 0.04 ) . DB04908 showed promising antidyskinetic effects in a model of drug-induced dyskinesia . Our data underline the possible benefit of P08908 agonists in drug-induced dyskinesia . Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of omapatrilat in heart failure . The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of omapatrilat , administered orally ( 25 mg ) or intravenously ( 10 mg ) in 19 New York Heart Association class II and class III congestive heart failure ( CHF ) patients versus 17 healthy controls matched for age , race , gender , and weight . The plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) increased by approximately 20 % and 30 % in CHF and control subjects , respectively , at 4 hours after intravenous or oral omapatrilat administration . Similar elevation in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentration ( 25 % to 35 % ) and P01160 urinary excretion ( 21 ng/24 h to 22 ng/24 h ) was seen in all treatment groups after omapatrilat administration . P12821 activity was > 90 % inhibited at 4 hours after dosing and remained approximately 60 % to 70 % inhibited at 24 hours after dosing . The levels of endothelin-1 and endothelin-2 remained unchanged after oral or intravenous administration of omapatrilat . The maximal reduction in seated blood pressure compared with baseline was similarfor CHF and control subjects . Clinical pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in both groups after intravenous dosing , but maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve were elevated in CHF patients compared with controls after oral dosing . DB00886 was well tolerated ; differences in systemic exposure and metabolism between CHF patients and controls did not appear to be clinically significant .
Modulation of antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal side effects by medications for mood disorders . Antipsychotic drugs are widely used not only for schizophrenia , but also for mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression . To evaluate the interactions between antipsychotics and drugs for mood disorders in modulating extrapyramidal side effects ( EPS ) , we examined the effects of antidepressants and mood-stabilizing drugs on haloperidol ( P42357 ) -induced bradykinesia and catalepsy in mice and rats . The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , fluoxetine and paroxetine , and the tricyclic antidepressant ( TCA ) clomipramine , which showed no EPS by themselves , significantly potentiated P42357 -induced bradykinesia and catalepsy in a dose-dependent manner . In contrast , the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant ( NaSSA ) mirtazapine failed to augment , but rather attenuated P42357 -induced bradykinesia and catalepsy . DB06148 also tended to reduce the EPS induction . In addition , neither treatment with lithium , sodium valproate nor carbamazepine potentiated P42357 -induced EPS . Furthermore , treatment of animals with ritanserin ( 5- Q13049 /2C antagonist ) , ondansetron ( 5- Q9H205 antagonist ) , and SB-258585 ( P50406 antagonist ) significantly antagonized the EPS augmentation by fluoxetine . Intrastriatal injection of ritanserin or SB-258585 , but not ondansetron , also attenuated the EPS induction . The present study suggests that NaSSAs are superior to SSRIs or TCAs in combined therapy for mood disorders with antipsychotics in terms of EPS induction . In addition , 5- Q13049 /2C , 5- Q9H205 and P50406 receptors seem to be responsible for the augmentation of antipsychotic-induced EPS by serotonin reuptake inhibitors . P01236 influence on cytosol and nuclear androgen receptors in the ventral , dorsal , and lateral lobes of the rat prostate . PRL augments testosterone-mediated growth of the prostate in a permissive manner . To elucidate the mechanism of this hormonal interaction , the present study examined the effect of PRL on cytosol and nuclear androgen receptors in the three prostate lobes . Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were castrated , given 5-mm Silastic implants of testosterone , and either grafted with two anterior pituitary glands under the kidney capsule or sham operated . Three weeks later , animals were killed , serum was collected for PRL and testosterone RIA , and the ventral , dorsal , and lateral prostate lobes were processed for either cytosol or nuclear androgen receptor quantitation . Pituitary grafts significantly elevated the serum PRL concentration and increased the weight and the content of protein and DNA of the lateral prostate lobe compared to control values . There was no effect on these parameters in the ventral or dorsal lobes . P10275 levels and apparent distributions were different in the ventral , dorsal , and lateral lobes of control animals . Unoccupied and total cytosolic androgen receptors in the three separate prostate lobes were not significantly affected by the presence of the grafts . However , an elevated PRL concentration was associated with an increase ( P less than 0.005 ) in nuclear androgen receptor content in the lateral lobe exclusively . The binding affinity was not altered by pituitary grafts in any of the lobes . These findings suggest that PRL promotes lateral prostatic growth by increasing nuclear androgen receptor levels in that tissue and , thus , optimizes its response to circulating testosterone . P61244 mutations status in Swedish patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma tumours . Pheochromocytoma ( DB09058 ) and Paraganglioma are rare tumours originating from neuroendocrine cells . Up to 60 % of cases have either germline or somatic mutation in one of eleven described susceptibility loci , P31040 , P21912 , Q99643 , O14521 , Q9NX18 , P40337 , Q99814 , P07949 , P21359 , O75204 and MYC associated factor-X ( P61244 ) . Recently , germline mutations in P61244 were found to confer susceptibility to DB09058 and paraganglioma ( PGL ) . A subsequent multicentre study found about 1 % of PCCs and PGLs to have germline or somatic mutations in P61244 . However , there has been no study investigating the frequency of P61244 mutations in a Scandinavian cohort . We analysed tumour specimens from 63 patients with DB09058 and PGL treated at Uppsala University hospital , Sweden , for re-sequencing of P61244 using automated Sanger sequencing . Our results show that 0 % ( 0/63 ) of tumours had mutations in P61244 . Allele frequencies of known single nucleotide polymorphisms rs4902359 , rs45440292 , rs1957948 and rs1957949 corresponded to those available in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database . We conclude that P61244 mutations remain unusual events and targeted genetic screening should be considered after more common genetic events have been excluded . Variants of dopamine and serotonin candidate genes as predictors of response to risperidone treatment in first-episode schizophrenia . AIMS : Abnormalities in dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission systems are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics . We conducted a pharmacogenetic study to evaluate whether variants in dopamine-related genes ( P21728 - P21918 , P31749 and GSK3beta ) and serotonin receptor genes ( P08908 , P28222 , P28221 , P28223 , P28335 , P50406 and P34969 ) can be used to predict the efficacy of risperidone treatment for schizophrenia . MATERIALS & METHODS : A total of 120 first-episode neuroleptic-naive schizophrenia patients were treated with risperidone monotherapy for 8 weeks and clinical symptoms were evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale . RESULTS : Among the 30 variants that we examined , two SNPs in P14416 ( -241A > G [ rs1799978 ] and TaqIA [ rs1800497 ] ) and two SNPs in P31749 ( P31749 -SNP1 [ rs3803300 ] and P31749 -SNP5 [ rs2494732 ] ) were significant predictors of treatment response to risperidone . CONCLUSION : These data suggest that the SNPs in P14416 and P31749 may influence the treatment response to risperidone in schizophrenia patients . Systematic meta-analyses and field synopsis of genetic association studies in schizophrenia : the SzGene database . In an effort to pinpoint potential genetic risk factors for schizophrenia , research groups worldwide have published over 1,000 genetic association studies with largely inconsistent results . To facilitate the interpretation of these findings , we have created a regularly updated online database of all published genetic association studies for schizophrenia ( ' SzGene ' ) . For all polymorphisms having genotype data available in at least four independent case-control samples , we systematically carried out random-effects meta-analyses using allelic contrasts . Across 118 meta-analyses , a total of 24 genetic variants in 16 different genes ( P02649 , P21964 , DAO , P21728 , P14416 , P21917 , Q96EV8 , P47870 , Q13224 , HP , P01584 , P42898 , O75051 , P31645 , P04637 and P17752 ) showed nominally significant effects with average summary odds ratios of approximately 1.23 . Seven of these variants had not been previously meta-analyzed . According to recently proposed criteria for the assessment of cumulative evidence in genetic association studies , four of the significant results can be characterized as showing ' strong ' epidemiological credibility . Our project represents the first comprehensive online resource for systematically synthesized and graded evidence of genetic association studies in schizophrenia . As such , it could serve as a model for field synopses of genetic associations in other common and genetically complex disorders . Differential effects of all-trans and 13-cis-retinoic acid on mRNA levels of nuclear retinoic acid receptors in rat lung and liver . The effects of three retinoids , all-trans-retinoic acid ( all-trans-RA ) , 13- DB00982 , and etretin were examined on mRNA abundance of nuclear retinoic acid receptors ( P10276 , beta , and gamma ) in lung and liver of retinol deficient and chow fed rats . All-trans-RA increased lung P10826 mRNA levels 5 or 11-fold in chow fed and retinol deficient rats , respectively . Similarly to lung , liver P10826 mRNA levels were 3-fold higher in retinol deficient rats fed all-trans-RA than the rats fed cottonseed oil . Lung P13631 mRNA levels were also induced 2-fold by all-trans-RA . In contrast to this , 13- DB00982 and etretin at equimolar doses failed to enhance lung or liver P10826 or lung P13631 mRNA levels in retinol deficient rats . These data for the first time show that all-trans-RA is more effective than its 13-cis-isomer in regulating the expression of P10826 and gamma transcripts in adult animal . Dopamine D1 , D2 and D3 receptor genes in alcohol dependence . Hereditary factors play a substantial role in the etiology of alcohol dependence . DB00898 mediates its reinforcing effects by an activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system . These findings suggest that the genes encoding the dopamine receptor ( DR ) subtypes represent high-ranking candidates for susceptibility genes to addictive disorders . Our present population-based association study investigated whether sequence variants of the dopamine D1 , D2 and D3 receptor genes confer susceptibility to alcohol dependence in 278 alcoholics , and clinically more homogeneous subgroups ascertained through positive family history , early age at onset , delirium , withdrawal seizures and antisocial tendencies . No evidence for an allelic association was found for the PCR-based TaqA RFLP fo the P14416 gene and a Bsp1286I RFLP of the P21728 gene . Without correction for multiple testing , we found a significantly increased allele frequency of a common P35462 gene variant expressing a serine at position 9 in the extracellular N-terminal part of the receptor protein in 55 alcohol-dependent individuals with delirium ( chi 2 = 4.1 , df = 1 , p = 0.042 ) . Further studies have to examine whether this amino acid substitution or a nearby mutation confers genetic susceptibility to at least a subgroup of alcohol-dependent individuals with delirium . Vitamin D analogues . The plethora of actions attributed to 1,25(OH)2D3 throughout the body have suggested potential therapeutic applications for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases , immune dysfunction , endocrine disorders , and metabolic bone disease . However , the potent calcemic activity of the natural vitamin D hormone has precluded its use in most cases . New vitamin D analogues are under development that display greater specificity , in most cases , by retaining the therapeutic properties of 1,25(OH)2D3 , but with lower calcemic activity . Two analogues have been approved for use in patients : calcipotriol ( DB02300 from Leo Pharmaceuticals , Copenhagen , Denmark ) for the treatment of psoriasis ; and 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D2 ( DB00910 from Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , IL ) for secondary hyperparathyroidism . Many others analogues are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of various types of cancer and osteoporosis , and for immunosuppression . The selectivity of the analogues can be attributed to the combined interactions with four proteins : the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , the serum vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) , the vitamin D-24-hydroxylase and to a newly described membrane receptor . Low DBP affinity has been shown to be responsible for the reduced calcemic actions of calcipotriol and 22-oxacalcitriol ( O75051 ) , which is being tested for secondary hyperparathyroidism . However , the low calcemic activity of other analogues , including 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D2 , involves other , as yet undefined , mechanisms . Understanding of the molecular basis for the selectivity of the vitamin D analogues will allow the design of more effective and safer vitamin D compounds for the treatment of a wide range of clinical disorders . Defective prolactin signaling impairs pancreatic β-cell development during the perinatal period . P01236 ( PRL ) and placental lactogens stimulate β-cell replication and insulin production in pancreatic islets and insulinoma cells through binding to the PRL receptor ( P16471 ) . However , the contribution of P16471 signaling to β-cell ontogeny and function in perinatal life and the effects of the lactogens on adaptive islet growth are poorly understood . We provide evidence that expansion of β-cell mass during both embryogenesis and the postnatal period is impaired in the P16471 (-/-) mouse model . P16471 (-/-) newborns display a 30 % reduction of β-cell mass , consistent with reduced proliferation index at E18.5 . PRL stimulates leucine incorporation and S6 kinase phosphorylation in P01308 -1 cells , supporting a role for β-cell P42345 signaling in PRL action . Interestingly , a defect in the development of acini is also observed in absence of P16471 signaling , with a sharp decline in cellular size in both endocrine and exocrine compartments . Of note , a decrease in levels of P01344 , a PRL target , in the Goto-Kakizaki ( GK ) rat , a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes , is associated with a lack of PRL-mediated β-cell proliferation in embryonic pancreatic buds . Reduced pancreatic P01344 expression in both rat and mouse models suggests that this factor may constitute a molecular link between PRL signaling and cell ontogenesis . Together , these results provide evidence that PRL signaling is essential for pancreas ontogenesis during the critical perinatal window responsible for establishing functional β-cell reserve . DB00139 dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- involvement of the mitochondrial DB03147 transporter , Flx1p . The mitochondrial DB03147 transporter , Flx1p , is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family responsible for DB03147 transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . It has also been suggested that it has a role in maintaining the normal activity of mitochondrial DB03147 -binding enzymes , including lipoamide dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit Sdh1p . A decrease in the amount of Sdh1p in the flx1Delta mutant strain has been determined here to be due to a post-transcriptional control that involves regulatory sequences located upstream of the P21912 coding sequence . The P21912 coding sequence and the regulatory sequences located downstream of the P21912 coding region , as well as protein import and cofactor attachment , seem to be not involved in the decrease in the amount of protein . Dopamine receptors and psychiatric drug treatment . The established antipsychotic drugs act mainly by antagonizing dopamine mediated synaptic transmission in the brain . Increase in the rate of production of dopamine metabolites as well as the firing rate of dopamine-containing neurons can be interpreted as compensatory responses to an interruption of synaptic transmission at dopamine nerve terminals . The demonstration of involvement of limbic and cortical mechanisms in the antipsychotic activity of neuroleptic drugs is far more difficult than the involvement of nigro-striatal and tubero-infundibular mechanisms in the neurological and neuroendocrine effects of these drugs . Application of radioreceptor techniques to dopamine research has supported the findings obtained by other neuropsychopharmacological research techniques , providing more direct evidence of dopamine receptor blockade by neuroleptic drugs . Further research is needed especially in studying the nature of the time-dependent adaptive changes at the receptor sites as well as the differences between the different dopamine projections and neural systems in the brain . The different subtypes of dopamine receptors in the brain , currently called D1 and D2 dopamine receptors , seem to be parallel , although in many respects independently-acting regulatory systems . P14416 -selective antagonists such as sulpiride seem to cause selective D2 receptor up-regulation . P01236 secretion seems to be regulated by D2 dopamine receptors . The exact physiological role of D1 dopamine receptors as well as the clinical consequences of selective D1 antagonism is not known . DB00391 and clozapine are examples of atypical neuroleptic compounds that have quite different profile of action , the former having strong and selective antidopaminergic action , the latter combining a number of non- dopaminergic mechanisms with rather slight effects on dopamine receptors. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) P01236 exerts a prosurvival effect on human spermatozoa via mechanisms that involve the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation and suppression of caspase activation and capacitation . The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of prolactin ( PRL ) on human sperm function , in light of a recent proteomic analysis indicating that these cells express the PRL receptor ( P16471 ) . Immunocytochemical analyses confirmed the presence of P16471 in human spermatozoa and localized this receptor to the postacrosomal region of the sperm head as well as the neck , midpiece , and principal piece of the sperm tail . Nested PCR analysis indicated that these cells possess four splice variants of the P16471 : the long form and three short isoforms , one of which is reported for the first time . A combination of Western blot analyses and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that PRL inhibited sperm capacitation in a dose-dependent manner , suppressing P12931 kinase activation and phosphotyrosine expression , two hallmarks of this process . The suppression of sperm capacitation was accompanied by a powerful prosurvival effect , supporting the prolonged motility of these cells and preventing the formation of spontaneous DNA strand breaks via mechanisms that involved the concomitant suppression of caspase activation . Western blot analyses indicated that the prosurvival effect of PRL on human spermatozoa involved the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation , whereas inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase and Akt negated this effect , as did the direct induction of sperm capacitation with DB02527 analogues . We conclude that PRL is a prosurvival factor for human spermatozoa that prevents these cells from defaulting to an intrinsic apoptotic pathway associated with cell senescence . These findings have implications for preservation of sperm integrity in vivo and in vitro . Analyses of cross species polymerase chain reaction products to infer the ancestral state of human polymorphisms . In numerous population genetic and disease association studies decisions about the ancestry of polymorphic alleles are often made based on the relative frequency of the alleles in the extant populations with the most frequent allele being deemed as ancestral . However , the frequency of an allele in a population is generally not a perfect indicator of its ancestral status . A more accurate method to assess ancestral/derived status of polymorphic alleles involves identification of shared alleles between species . We used this strategy to examine genomic regions homologous to several human polymorphisms in four species of non-human primates . Cross species polymerase chain reaction ( CS-PCR ) , with primers designed from human sequence , was used to investigate regions of interest . Nineteen polymorphisms at six loci ( P14416 , HOXB@ , PAH , D4S10 , P10745 , and P07949 ) were examined either by restriction fragment length analysis of PCR products ( PCR-RFLP ) or by direct sequencing . At seventeen of the eighteen PCR-RFLPs , non-human primates were monomorphic and identical to each other for either lack of restriction enzyme site or presence of the site . Thus , at these seventeen polymorphic sites the shared alleles are most likely to be the ancestral ones in humans . In several cases we have used sequence data to further demonstrate that the nucleotide at the site of the polymorphism is conserved between species confirming the hypothesis of a single ancestral allele . However , not all human alleles can be simply resolved into ancestral and derived ; sequence data from one PCR-RFLP ( in an intron of the PAH locus ) and a single strand conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) in the 3' untranslated region ( UTR ) of the P14416 gene illustrate this point . [ P62158 -dependent regulation of Ca,Mg-ATPase activity in plasma membranes of the swine myometrium ] . Highly purified plasma membrane ( PM ) preparations of pig myometrium were found to contain 0.91 +/- 0.22 microgram calmodulin per mg of PM protein . Treatment of membranes with 1 mM EGTA in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl causes the diminution of the calmodulin content down to 3 % of the original level . The activity of Ca , Mg-ATPase is thereby decreased by 40 % . Exogenous calmodulin restores the enzyme activity up to 1.94 +/- +/- 0.30 mumol Pi/mg protein/hour . The maximal activation of Ca , Mg-ATPase is observed with 10(-7) M calmodulin . P62158 increases the total ATPase activity of myometrium PM without affecting the Mg-ATPase activity . DB00831 ( 20 microM ) diminishes the activating effect of exogenous calmodulin on Ca , Mg-ATPase . P62158 stimulates Ca , Mg-ATPase at low concentrations of Ca2+ ( 10(-8)-10(-6) M ) by decreasing Km for Ca2+ from 0.4.10(-6) M to 2.10(-8) M as well as by increasing Vmax -- from 0,8 to 1.42 mumol Pl/mg protein/hour . It is supposed that the activating effect of calmodulin on Ca , Mg-ATPase is based on electrostatic interactions of Ca2+-free calmodulin with the enzyme . Evaluation of the endogenous cannabinoid system in mediating the behavioral effects of dipyrone ( metamizol ) in mice . DB04817 is a common nonopioid analgesic and antipyretic , which , in many countries , is available over the counter and is more widely used than paracetamol or aspirin . However , the exact mechanisms by which dipyrone acts remain inconclusive . Two novel arachidonoyl-conjugated metabolites are formed in mice following the administration of dipyrone that are dependent on the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) , which also represents the major catabolic enzyme of the endogenous cannabinoid ligand anandamide . These arachidonoyl metabolites not only inhibit cyclooxygenase ( P23219 / P35354 ) but also bind to cannabinoid receptors at low micromolar concentrations . The relative contributions of cannabinoid receptors and FAAH in the overall behavioral response to dipyrone remain untested . Accordingly , the two primary objectives of the present study were to determine whether the behavioral effects of dipyrone would ( a ) be blocked by cannabinoid receptor antagonists and ( b ) occur in FAAH mice . Here , we report that thermal antinociceptive , hypothermic , and locomotor suppressive actions of dipyrone are mediated by a noncannabinoid receptor mechanism of action and occurred after acute or repeated administration irrespective of FAAH . These findings indicate that FAAH-dependent arachidonoyl metabolites and cannabinoid receptors are not requisites by which dipyrone exerts these pharmacological effects under noninflammatory conditions . Topical rapamycin ( sirolimus ) for facial angiofibromas . DB00877 ( sirolimus ) is a fungal fermentation product that inhibits the proper functioning of a serine/threonine protein kinase in mammalian cells eponymously named mammalian target of rapamycin , or P42345 . DB00877 is a novel class of anticancer and immunosuppressant drugs targeting the proteins at molecular level . DB00877 ( sirolimus ) is routinely incorporated in drug-eluting stents used for cardiac angioplasty . In recent years , rapamycin was found to be efficacious in managing the symptom complex of tuberous sclerosis , i.e. renal angiomyolipoma , giant cell astrocytoma and pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis . Various investigators have also proved that topically applied rapamycin causes regression of facial angiofibromas , giving better cosmetic results . P10275 in human placental villi . In studies with a synthetic androgen , R 1881 , an androgen-binding component was found in the cytosol of human placental villi . Kinetic analysis indicated that the Kd value of this component was 1.4 nM at 0-4 degrees C and that binding of R 1881 amounted to 277 +/- 73 fmol/mg protein. glycerol density gradient ultracentrifugation showed a peak of binding activity in the 8S region in a medium of low ionic strength , but in the 4.5S region in a medium containing 9.5 M DB00761 . The R 1881-binding component was inactivated by mild heat- or trypsin-treatment , but not by treatment with DNase or RNase . Most of the R 1881-binding activity was sedimented at 20 to 40 % saturation of ammonium sulfate . These findings indicate that the R 1881-binding component in human placental cytosol is quite similar in its characteristics to androgen receptors , which are present in various androgen-responsive organs . DB00624 was a more potent competitor of R 1881-binding than DB02901 or cyproterone acetate . Scatchard plots indicated that the binding site of testosterone was identical with that of R 1881 . These findings suggest that the androgen receptor in placental cytosol is specific for testosterone . The Kd value for testosterone was calculated to be 3.2 nM . miRNA signature and Dicer requirement during human endometrial stromal decidualization in vitro . Decidualization is a morphological and biochemical transformation of endometrial stromal fibroblast into differentiated decidual cells , which is critical for embryo implantation and pregnancy establishment . The complex regulatory networks have been elucidated at both the transcriptome and the proteome levels , however very little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of this process . miRNAs regulate multiple physiological pathways and their de-regulation is associated with human disorders including gynaecological conditions such as endometriosis and preeclampsia . In this study we profile the miRNAs expression throughout human endometrial stromal ( hESCs ) decidualization and analyze the requirement of the miRNA biogenesis enzyme Dicer during this process . A total of 26 miRNAs were upregulated and 17 miRNAs downregulated in decidualized hESCs compared to non-decidualized hESCs . Three miRNAs families , miR-181 , miR-183 and miR-200 , are down-regulated during the decidualization process . Using miRNAs target prediction algorithms we have identified the potential targets and pathways regulated by these miRNAs . The knockdown of Dicer has a minor effect on hESCs during in vitro decidualization . We have analyzed a battery of decidualization markers such as cell morphology , P01236 , P08833 , P55773 and P35625 secretion as well as P31260 , P35354 , SP1 , C/EBPß and Q12778 expression in decidualized hESCs with decreased Dicer function . We found decreased levels of P31260 and altered intracellular organization of actin filaments in Dicer knockdown decidualized hESCs compared to control . Our results provide the miRNA signature of hESC during the decidualization process in vitro . We also provide the first functional characterization of Dicer during human endometrial decidualization although surprisingly we found that Dicer plays a minor role regulating this process suggesting that alternative biogenesis miRNAs pathways must be involved in human endometrial decidualization . Human chromosome 3 and pig chromosome 13 show complete synteny conservation but extensive gene-order differences . A comparative map of human chromosome 3 ( HSA 3 ) and pig chromosome 13 ( SSC 13 ) was constructed using physically assigned pig sequence-tagged sites ( STSs ) . Pig STSs representing 11 HSA 3 genes , including v- P04049 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 ( P04049 ) , retinoic acid beta receptor ( P10826 ) , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , pituitary transcription factor 1 ( P28069 ) , ceruloplasmin ( CP ) , guanine nucleotide binding protein , alpha-inhibiting polypeptide 2 ( P04899 ) , sucrase-isomaltase ( SI ) , rhodopsin ( P08100 ) , dopamine receptor D3 ( P35462 ) , growth-associated protein 43 ( P17677 ) , and somatostatin ( P61278 ) , were developed . Ten pig STSs were regionally mapped using a somatic cell hybrid panel ( SCHP ) to SSC 13 with 80-100 % concordance . Large-insert probes were obtained by screening a pig yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) library with primers for each STS . Several YACs were identified for P35462 , P17677 , P28069 , P08100 , SI , and P61278 for fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) mapping . Single gene and bi-color Q5TCZ1 with each pairwise combination were used to further define the gene order on SSC 13 . While these data confirm chromosome painting results showing that HSA 3 probes hybridize to a major portion of SSC 13 , they also demonstrate extensive gene-order differences between man and pig within this large conserved synteny group . Interestingly , several conserved chromosomal regions have been detected between pig and mouse that are not conserved between man and mouse , suggesting that the SSC 13 gene arrangement may be the closest to that of the ancestral eutherian chromosome . Agonism of human pregnane X receptor by rilpivirine and etravirine : comparison with first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors . DB08864 and etravirine are second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors approved recently by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection . O75469 ( O75469 ) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of various genes controlling diverse biological functions . The present study investigated the effects of rilpivirine and etravirine on the activity of human O75469 ( hPXR ) , including the mode of activation , and compared them to those of efavirenz , nevirapine , and delavirdine , which are first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors . In transiently transfected HepG2 cells , rilpivirine , etravirine , and efavirenz , but not nevirapine or delavirdine , activated human , mouse , and rat O75469 . Results from mechanistic studies indicated that rilpivirine , etravirine , and efavirenz , but not nevirapine or delavirdine , bound to the ligand-binding domain of hPXR , as assessed by a transactivation assay and by a competitive ligand-binding assay using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer ; triggered nuclear translocation of a green fluorescence protein-tagged hPXR , as visualized by confocal imaging ; and recruited steroid receptor coactivator-1 ( Q15788 ) , P12931 -2 , and Q9Y6Q9 to hPXR , as demonstrated by mammalian two-hybrid assays . DB08864 , etravirine , and efavirenz , but not nevirapine or delavirdine , increased hPXR target gene ( P08684 ) expression in primary cultures of human hepatocytes . In summary , select non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors activated human and rodent O75469 . DB08864 , etravirine , and efavirenz , but not nevirapine or delavirdine , were identified as agonists of hPXR , as assessed in mechanistic experiments , and inducers of P08684 , as determined in primary cultures of human hepatocytes . Gene expression profiles of adipose tissue of obese rats after central administration of neuropeptide Y- Q15761 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides by cDNA microarrays . To investigate the gene expression profiles of adipose tissue of obese rats after central administration of neuropeptide Y- Q15761 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODNs ) , Q15761 antisense , mismatched ODNs or vehicle was intracerebroventricularly injected and cDNA microarrays were undertaken . Central administration of Q15761 antisense ODNs decreased food intake , body weight and serum insulin compared with both vehicle and mismatched ODNs . The average area of adipocytes both at retroperitoneal and epididymal adipose tissue were fall in antisense group while only the weight of the retroperitoneal fat pats was reduced in antisense group . cDNA microarrays containing 18,000 genes/Ests were used to investigate gene expression of adipose tissue . Autoradiographic analysis showed that 404 , 81 , and 34 genes were differently expressed over twofold , threefold , and fivefold , respectively . The analysis of gene expression profiles indicated that 332 genes were up-regulated and 187 genes were down-regulated in response to Q15761 antisense ODNs treatment . Different clusters of genes associated with apoptosis , signal transduction , energy metabolism , lipid metabolism , etc. , such as P51114 , Q8WV24 , Q7L5Y9 , P27986 , P13598 , Q00169 , P62158 , Q13557 , P61925 , P14416 , O95258 , CKB , P22760 , P38571 , O15254 , O60427 , were concerned . Analysis of differentially expressed genes will help to understand the effects of Q15761 antisense ODNs therapy . [ DB00391 in the management of functional dyspepsia and delayed gastric emptying ] . DB00391 is a sulpiride isomer that exerts its prokinetic action through a dual mechanism : 1 ) as a P14416 antagonist and 2 ) as a serotonin 5HT(4) receptor agonist , conferring this drug with a cholinergic effect . At a dosage of 25mg three times daily , levosulpiride accelerates gastric and gallbladder emptying . Clinical trials have shown that this agent is more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of dyspepsia , while comparative studies have demonstrated that its effect is similar or superior to that of other dopamine antagonists . The safety profile of levosulpiride is good and the frequency of adverse events is similar to that of other D(2) dopamine antagonists . Therefore , this drug is a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with functional dyspepsia , as well as in those with delayed gastric emptying .
P01308 /FGF-binding ciliary membrane glycoprotein from Tetrahymena . Triton X-100 extracted ciliary membrane protein from isolated cilia , prepared from the protozoon Tetrahymena thermophila , were fractionated by affinity chromatography on columns with covalently bound fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , insulin , or concanavalin A ( ConA ) , respectively . The eluted proteins were further analyzed by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels , isoelectric focusing , and by immunoblotting techniques using antibodies against the FGF receptor , platetelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor alpha-subunit , and insulin receptor beta-subunit . The particular antibodies were chosen because the peptides PDGF , FGF , insulin , and ConA are chemoattractants in this organism and corresponding binding ( receptor ) proteins could be expected to be identified . A 66 kDa protein fraction was eluted from the FGF-MiniLeak agarose , insulin-MiniLeak agarose and ConA sepharose . This fraction responded in Western immunoblots to an antibody against the beta-subunit of the human insulin receptor , to an antibody against the PDGF receptor ( P09619 ) and also to an antibody against the bovine FGF receptor ( FGFR ) that is known , in other systems , to inhibit FGF binding to its receptor . When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue the 66 kDa fraction appeared as a single component . However , in some experiments it appeared more heterogeneous when stained with silver indicating the presence of minor components that may be a procedural artifact or isoforms of the same glycoprotein . The 66 kDa protein(s) migrated in isoelectric focusing with a pI of 7.4 . The results are discussed in terms of the possible role of the 66 kDa glycoprotein as a protein involved in peptide-mediated cell signalling . Pharmacologic modulation of niche accessibility via tyrosine kinase inhibition enhances marrow and thymic engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Essential survival signals within hematopoietic stem cell ( P19526 ) and thymic niches are mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases , which can be reversibly inhibited using clinically available drugs . We studied whether sunitinib , a multityrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits P10721 , enhances engraftment after bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) in mice . DB01268 diminished hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers , and sunitinib enhanced marrow , peripheral myeloid , and lymphoid engraftment after BMT in Rag1(-/-) mice . DB01268 augmented P19526 engraftment because recipients displayed increased myeloid and lymphoid engraftment and because sunitinib-treated recipients of purified HSCs showed enhanced engraftment of secondary hosts . However , sunitinib preferentially augmented T-cell engraftment with lesser effects on myeloid and P19526 engraftment . Consistent with this , sunitinib preferentially depleted the early thymic progenitor subset in the thymus . DB01268 did not increase engraftment in mice with deficient P10721 signaling , and the pattern of more potent effects on T cell compared with P19526 engraftment observed in sunitinib-treated hosts was also observed after BMT into P10721 (W/Wv) mice . These results implicate P10721 as a critical modulator of thymic niches . We conclude that transient , pharmacologic inhibition of P10721 enhances accessibility of marrow and thymic niches , and provides a novel , noncytotoxic approach to accomplish engraftment after stem cell transplantation . PDE10 inhibition increases P42261 and CREB phosphorylation and improves spatial and recognition memories in a Huntington 's disease mouse model . Huntington 's disease ( HD ) causes motor disturbances , preceded by cognitive impairment , in patients and mouse models . We showed that increased hippocampal DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) signaling disrupts recognition and spatial memories in R6 HD mouse models . However , unchanged levels of hippocampal phosphorylated ( p ) DB02527 -responsive element-binding protein ( CREB ) suggested unaltered nuclear PKA activity in R6 mice . Here , we extend this finding by showing that nuclear pPKA catalytic subunit ( Thr197 ) and pPKA substrate levels were unaltered in the hippocampus of R6/1 mice . Phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) play an important role in the regulation of PKA activity . Q9Y233 , a DB02527 /cGMP dual-substrate PDE , was reported to be restricted to the nuclear region in nonstriatal neurons . Using cell fractionation we confirmed that Q9Y233 was enriched in nuclear fractions , both in wild-type and R6/1 mice hippocampus , without differences in its levels or intracellular distribution between genotypes . We next investigated whether inhibition of PDE10 with papaverine could improve cognitive function in HD mice . DB01113 treatment improved spatial and object recognition memories in R6/1 mice , and significantly increased pGluA1 and pCREB levels in R6/1 mice hippocampus . DB01113 likely acted through the activation of the PKA pathway as the phosphorylation level of distinct cGMP-dependent kinase ( cGK ) substrates was not modified in either genotype . Moreover , hippocampal DB02527 , but not cGMP , levels were increased after acute papaverine injection . Our results show that inhibition of PDE10 improves cognition in R6 mice , at least in part through increased P42261 and CREB phosphorylation . Thus , PDE10 might be a good therapeutic target to improve cognitive impairment in HD . [ Drugs stimulating insulin release. Importance of their use for improving glycemia , safety and quality of life in diabetes mellitus type 2 ] . Etiopathogenesis of diabetes mellitus is bipolar . On one hand there occurs impairment in beta-cell function caused by genetic factors or abnormal development during fetal period . On the other hand defects of peripheral insulin action are also of significant importance . The bipolarity is also expressed by changing relationship between genetic and environmental factors . P01308 release is connected with closing DB00171 -dependent kalium channel , a structure closely connected with sulfonylurea receptors . Several receptors may be distinguished : Q09428 in Langerhans isles and SUR2 in heart ( SUR2A ) and vessel smoot muscles ( SUR2B ) . In the treatment of insulin release disorders sulfonylureas are still of significant importance though repaglinid and phenyloalanine derivates also have some clinical importance . Within sulfonylurea derivates there have been developed some preparations of slow drug release ( DB01067 GITS , Diaprel MR ) . One daily dose of DB01067 GITS and lower tendency to hypoglycaemia favour acceptation of the therapy by the patients what is also important for their quality of life . Quality of life is now regarded as important as obtaining good indices of diabetes control . The increase of memory T cell subsets in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome . Two-color and three-color flow cytometry was carried out to determine whether the memory T cells ( CD45RO+ T cells ) play a major role in lymphocyte dysfunction of 26 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome ( P01308 ) . The P01308 patients were divided into three groups : ( 1 ) 10 patients who were not receiving glucocorticoid hormone ( P30793 ) and were suffering from acute nephrotic state were referred to as N1 ; ( 2 ) 8 patients who were in remission maintained by P30793 therapy alone were referred to as N2 ; ( 3 ) 8 patients who were free of P30793 therapy for at least 4 months were referred to as N3 . Group N1 demonstrated a significant increase in the percentage of CD45RO+ P01730 + T cells and CD45RO+CD8+ T cells ( p < 0.05 ) compared with 11 controls , and these subsets were noted to have a tendency to decrease to control levels in groups N2 and N3 . Furthermore , interleukin-2 receptor-alpha expressed subsets in CD45RO+ P01730 + T cells ( CD45RO+ P01730 +CD25+ T cells ) were also increased only in group N1 ( p < 0.02 ) . A similar tendency of absolute counts was observed in these subsets . These results suggest that activated memory T cells reflect lymphocyte dysfunction at initial onset or relapse in P01308 children . Immunoaffinity purification of the functional 20S proteasome from human cells via transient overexpression of specific proteasome subunits . The proteasome is a multi-subunit proteolytic complex that plays a central role in protein degradation in all eukaryotic cells . It regulates many vital cellular processes therefore its dysfunction can lead to various pathologies including cancer and neurodegeneration . Isolation of enzymatically active proteasomes is a key step to the successful study of the proteasome regulation and functions . Here we describe a simple and efficient protocol for immunoaffinity purification of the functional 20S proteasomes from human P29320 293T cells after transient overexpression of specific proteasome subunits tagged with 3xFLAG . To construct 3xFLAG-fusion proteins , DNA sequences encoding the 20S proteasome subunits P28074 , P28066 , and P25788 were cloned into mammalian expression vector pIRES-hrGFP-1a . The corresponding recombinant proteins P28074 -3xFLAG , P28066 -3xFLAG , or P25788 -3xFLAG were transiently overexpressed in human P29320 293T cells and were shown to be partially incorporated into the intact proteasome complexes . 20S proteasomes were immunoprecipitated from P29320 293T cell extracts under mild conditions using antibodies against FLAG peptide . Isolation of highly purified 20S proteasomes were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies against different proteasome subunits . Affinity purified 20S proteasomes were shown to possess chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like peptidase activities confirming their functionality . This simple single-step affinity method of the 20S proteasome purification can be instrumental to subsequent functional studies of proteasomes in human cells . Potent and selective activation of the pancreatic beta-cell type K( DB00171 ) channel by two novel diazoxide analogues . AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : We investigated the pharmacological properties of two novel DB00171 sensitive potassium ( K( DB00171 ) ) channel openers , 6-Chloro-3-isopropylamino-4 H-thieno [ 3,2- e ] -1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide ( NNC 55-0118 ) and 6-chloro-3-(1-methylcyclopropyl)amino-4 H-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide ( NN414 ) , on the cloned cardiac ( Kir6.2/SUR2A ) , smooth muscle ( Kir6.2/SUR2B ) and pancreatic beta cell ( Kir6.2/ Q09428 ) types of K( DB00171 ) channel . METHODS : We studied the effects of these compounds on whole-cell currents through cloned K( DB00171 ) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells ( HEK293 ) . We also used inside-out macropatches excised from Xenopus oocytes . RESULTS : In P29320 293 cells , NNC 55-0118 and NN414 activated Kir6.2/ Q09428 currents with EC(50) values of 0.33 micromol/l and 0.45 micromol/l , respectively , compared with that of 31 micro mol/l for diazoxide . Neither compound activated Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2/SUR2B channels expressed in oocytes , nor did they activate Kir6.2 expressed in the absence of Q09428 . Current activation was dependent on the presence of intracellular MgATP , but was not supported by MgADP . CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION : Both NNC 55-0118 and NN414 selectively stimulate the pancreatic beta-cell type of K( DB00171 ) channel with a higher potency than diazoxide , by interaction with the Q09428 subunit . The high selectivity and efficacy of the compounds could prove useful for treatment of disease states where inhibition of insulin secretion is beneficial . Further evidence for a functional role of the glutamate receptor gene Q14832 in schizophrenia . In recent years , evidence has been accumulating indicating a major role of glutamate in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of schizophrenia . Of particular importance in this regard are the metabotropic glutamate receptors ( GRM ) . Thus , a recently published trial of the amino acid analogue DB05096 , which exerts its effects through the activation of the glutamate receptors Q14832 / Q14416 , showed an improvement of positive and negative symptoms comparable to treatment with olanzapine . A functional variant of Q14832 has been described which modulates synaptic glutamate levels . We assessed whether this functional variant rs6465084 is related to schizophrenia in a large sample of patients and controls . We found an increased frequency of the A allele ( p=0.027 ) and the AA genotype ( p=0.024 ) in schizophrenia patients . Moreover , in an assessment of schizophrenia endophenotypes , patients of the AA genotype performed poorly in the digit symbol test , a measure of attention ( p=0.008 ) . Our results provide further evidence for the potential importance of the glutamate receptor Q14832 in schizophrenia , and indicate that the novel antipsychotic DB05096 may actually be targeting a pathogenic pathway of schizophrenia . DB00501 enhances antigen-specific IgE and Th2 cytokine production . BACKGROUND : Treatment with anti-ulcer drugs has been shown to enhance IgE production against food antigens . However , little is known about the immunological effects of cimetidine , a histamine receptor type 2 ( P25021 ) antagonist that is widely used as an anti-ulcer drug , in allergy . Therefore , the present study investigated the role of cimetidine in Th2 immune responses in mice . METHODS : BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin ( OVA ) with and without cimetidine . The levels of cytokines in supernatants of spleen cells cultured in the presence of OVA for 4 days and the levels of total and OVA-specific IgG(1) , IgG(2a) and/or IgE in sera from these mice were determined by ELISA . RESULTS : Administration of cimetidine to OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice promoted Th2 cytokine secretion by OVA-stimulated spleen cells in vitro and increased serum levels of OVA-specific IgE , IgG(1) and IgG(2a) . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that cimetidine can enhance Th2 responses , suggesting that cimetidine may contribute to IgE production in allergies . A critical role for P01344 in memory consolidation and enhancement . We report that , in the rat , administering insulin-like growth factor II ( P01344 , also known as P01344 ) significantly enhances memory retention and prevents forgetting . Inhibitory avoidance learning leads to an increase in hippocampal expression of P01344 , which requires the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein β and is essential for memory consolidation . Furthermore , injections of recombinant P01344 into the hippocampus after either training or memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention and prevent forgetting . To be effective , P01344 needs to be administered within a sensitive period of memory consolidation . P01344 -dependent memory enhancement requires P01344 receptors , new protein synthesis , the function of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein and glycogen-synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) . Moreover , it correlates with a significant activation of synaptic GSK3β and increased expression of GluR1 ( also known as P42261 ) α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid receptor subunits . In hippocampal slices , P01344 promotes P11717 -dependent , persistent long-term potentiation after weak synaptic stimulation . Thus , P01344 may represent a novel target for cognitive enhancement therapies . No evidence of mutations of the P28074 ( beta-5 subunit of proteasome ) in a case of myeloma with clinical resistance to DB00188 . Rindopepimut , a 14-mer injectable peptide vaccine against EGFRvIII for the potential treatment of glioblastoma multiforme . Celldex Therapeutics is developing rindopepimut ( DB05374 ) , a 14-mer injectable peptide vaccine for the potential treatment of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Rindopepimut specifically targets a novel junctional epitope of the P00533 deletion mutant EGFRvIII , which is a constitutively active receptor that is expressed in approximately 60 to 70 % of patients with GBM . EGFRvIII expression is correlated with worse prognosis and reduced overall survival . Importantly , EGFRvIII is not expressed in normal brain tissue , making it an excellent therapeutic target . Preclinical studies demonstrated lasting tumor regression and increased survival times , as well as efficient generation of EGFRvIII-specific humoral and cellular immune responses , in animals expressing EGFRvIII and vaccinated with rindopepimut . Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with GBM demonstrated significantly increased median time to progression and overall survival time in those vaccinated with rindopepimut compared with matched historical controls . Only limited side effects have been observed in patients . Given these results , rindopepimut is an extremely promising therapy for patients with GBM . Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with GBM were ongoing at the time of publication . In the future , it may be beneficial to combine rindopepimut with other treatment modalities to further prolong survival . [ Activation of coagulation cascade in children during an idiopathic nephrotic syndrome relapse ] . The objective of this study was to assess concentrations of selected markers of coagulation in children with relapse of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome during a 6-week therapy . Study groups : 22 subjects ( 32 relapses ) -- 14 males , 8 females ( mean age 7.15 +/- 1.5 y. ) with no thrombotic complications were included into the study . All children were clinically steroid-sensitive . METHODS : Coagulation markers ( platelet count , thrombin time , APTT , INR , fibrinogen 1 + 2 fragments ( F1 + 2 ) , thrombin-antithrombin complexes ( TAT ) , serum levels of D-dimer ( DD ) , fibrin monomers ( FM ) and antithrombin activity ( P01008 ) ) were measured three times : on admission , after 2 and 6 weeks . The control group consisted of 13 healthy children . RESULTS : Serum concentration of TAT or F1 + 2 did not differ between 3 stages ( p > 0.05 ) . However , values at 0 and 2 weeks were significantly higher than in control group ( p < 0.05 ) . We found no correlation between TAT or F1 + 2 and FBG , ALB , TCH , TG levels . [ table : see text ] CONCLUSIONS : The coagulation cascade in relapse of NS was activated during first 6 weeks of therapy whereas metabolic disturbances ( low ALB , high P02675 , TCH , TG , high platelets ) normalized . It is speculative whether it was caused by active immunological process but definitely it resulted in " prothrombotic state " in P01308 patients . The regulation of rotenone-induced inflammatory factor production by DB00171 -sensitive potassium channel expressed in BV-2 cells . Our previous studies have demonstrated that activating DB00171 -sensitive potassium channel ( K( DB00171 ) channel ) , not only improved Parkinsonian behavior and neurochemical symptoms , but also reduced P35228 activity and mRNA levels in striatum and nigra of rotenone rat model of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . In this study , it was first shown that the subunits of K( DB00171 ) channels are expressed in BV-2 cells , and then it was investigated whether K( DB00171 ) channel was involved in regulating inflammatory factor production from BV-2 cells activated by rotenone . It was found that K( DB00171 ) channel was expressed in BV-2 cell and formed by the combination of Kir 6.1 and Q09428 2A/2B . K( DB00171 ) channel openers ( KCOs ) including pinacidil , diazoxide and iptakalim ( Ipt ) exerted beneficial effects on rotenone-induced morphological alterations of BV-2 cells , decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) production and the expression and activity of inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) . Either glibenclamide or 5-hydroxydecanoate acid ( a selective mitochondrial K( DB00171 ) channel blocker ) could abolish the effects of KCOs , suggesting that K( DB00171 ) channels , especially mitochondrial DB00171 -sensitive potassium channels ( mitoK( DB00171 ) channels ) , played a crucial role in preventing the activation of BV-2 cells , and subsequently the production of a variety of proinflammatory factors . Therefore , activation of K( DB00171 ) channel might be a new therapeutic strategy for treating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders . Arachidonic acid signaling is involved in the mechanism of imidazoline-induced KATP channel-independent stimulation of insulin secretion . The mechanism by which the novel , pure glucose-dependent insulinotropic , imidazoline derivative BL11282 promotes insulin secretion in pancreatic islets has been investigated . The roles of KATP channels , alpha2-adrenoreceptors , the I1-receptor-phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase ( PC- P98160 ) pathway and arachidonic acid signaling in BL11282 potentiation of insulin secretion in pancreatic islets were studied . Using Q09428 (-/-) deficient mice , the previous notion that the insulinotropic activity of BL11282 is not related to its interaction with KATP channels was confirmed . Insulinotropic activity of BL11282 was not related to its effect on alpha2-adrenoreceptors , I1-imidazoline receptors or PC- P98160 . BL11282 significantly increased [3H]arachidonic acid production . This effect was abolished in the presence of the iPLA2 inhibitor , bromoenol lactone . The data suggest that potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release by BL11282 , which is independent of concomitant changes in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration , involves release of arachidonic acid by iPLA2 and its metabolism to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids through the cytochrome P-450 pathway . Genetically rescued tetrahydrobiopterin-depleted mice survive with hyperphenylalaninemia and region-specific monoaminergic abnormalities . One of the possibly mutated genes in DOPA-responsive dystonia ( DRD , Segawa 's disease ) is the gene encoding P30793 , which is the rate-limiting enzyme for tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) biosynthesis . Based on our findings on 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase ( Q03393 ) gene-disrupted ( Pts(-/-) ) mice , we suggested that the amount of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) protein in dopaminergic nerve terminals is regulated by the intracellular concentration of BH4 . In this present work , we rescued Pts(-/-) mice by transgenic introduction of human Q03393 cDNA under the control of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase promoter to examine regional differences in the sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to BH4-insufficiency . The DPS-rescued ( Pts(-/-) , DPS ) mice showed severe hyperphenylalaninemia . Human Q03393 was efficiently expressed in noradrenergic regions but only in a small number of dopaminergic neurons . DB03886 and dopamine contents , and TH activity in the striatum were poorly restored compared with those in the midbrain . TH-immunoreactivity in the lateral region of the striatum was far weaker than that in the medial region or in the nucleus accumbens . We concluded that dopaminergic nerve terminals projecting to the lateral region of the striatum are the most sensitive to BH4-insufficiency . Biochemical and pathological changes in DPS-rescued mice were similar to those in human malignant hyperphenylalaninemia and DRD . DB00501 in elective Caesarean section . Effect on gastric acidity . Aspiration pneumonitis , Mendelson 's syndrome , continues to be an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in obstetric anaesthesia , despite widespread adoption of the practice of routine administration of alkalis . P25021 blocking drugs have been shown to reduce gastric secretion in non-obstetric patients . DB00501 was given intravenously to fasting patients before elective Caesarean section . In all 10 patients who received cimetidine 200 mg intravenously at 60 -- 80 minutes before anaesthesia , the pH of gastric contents at the time of induction was above 2.5 . When the interval between administration of the drug and induction of anaesthesia was only 30 -- 40 minutes ( six patients ) or was over 90 minutes ( 20 patients ) then the pH was raised to above this value in only two-thirds of patients . By contrast eight of 10 untreated patients were found to have a gastric pH of less than 2.5 . No adverse effects of cimetidine were seen in mothers or infants . Genetic and epigenetic markers in the evaluation of pancreatic masses . BACKGROUND : Methylation markers have shown promise in the early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma . The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic utility of hypermethylation status of candidate genes in combination with P01116 mutation detection in the evaluation of pancreatic masses . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Sixty-one fine needle aspirates of pancreatic masses ( 43 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 18 chronic pancreatitis ) were studied . Methylation status of P25021 , Q05925 , P09486 , P55290 and P25054 were analysed using melting curve analysis after DNA bisulfite treatment . P01116 mutations were also analysed . RESULTS : The methylation panel had a sensitivity of 73 % ( 27 of 37 , CI 95 % 56 to 86 % ) and a specificity of 100 % whenever two or more promoters were found hypermethylated . P01116 mutations showed a sensitivity of 77 % ( 33 of 43 , CI 95 % 62 to 88 % ) and a specificity of 100 % . Both molecular analyses added useful information to cytology by increasing the number of informative cases . When genetic and epigenetic analyses were combined sensitivity was 84 % ( 36 of 43 CI 95 % 69 to 93 % ) maintaining a 100 % specificity . CONCLUSIONS : Analysis of hypermethylation status of a panel of genes and P01116 mutation detection offer a similar diagnostic yield in the evaluation of pancreatic masses . The combined molecular analysis increases the number of informative cases without diminishing specificity . Expression and possible role of IGF-IR in the mouse gastric myenteric plexus and smooth muscles . P01308 -like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) and its receptor ( IGF-IR ) have tremendous trophic effects on the central , peripheral and enteric neurons . The loss of IGF-IR contributes to the development of diabetic gastroparesis . However , the nature and the function of the IGF-IR(+) cells in the gastric myenteric plexus remain unclear . In this study , anti- P28329 , anti-S100β or anti-c- P10721 antibodies were used to co-label IGF-IR(+) cells and neurons , glial cells or interstitial cells of Cajal ( ICCs ) , respectively . We also generated type 1 diabetic mice ( DM ) to explore the influence of impaired P05019 /IGF-IR in the myenteric neurons . Results showed that IGF-IR was expressed in the epithelium , smooth muscles and myenteric plexi of the mouse stomach . Most of the IGF-IR(+) cells in the myenteric plexi were P28329 (+) cholinergic neurons , but not enteric glial cells and there were more IGF-IR(+) neurons and fibers in the gastric antrum than in the corpus . The IGF-IR(+)/ P28329 (+) neurons and ICCs were closely juxtaposed , but distinctly distributed in the myenteric plexus , indicating a possible role for the IGF-IR(+)/ P28329 (+) neurons in the mediation of gastric motility through ICCs . Moreover , the decrease of IGF-IR and cholinergic neurons in the myenteric plexi and smooth muscles of DM mice suggested that P05019 /IGF-IR signaling might play a role in neuron survival and neurite outgrowth , as well as stem cell factor ( P21583 ) production , which is required for the development of ICCs . Our results provide insights into the effects of P05019 /IGF-IR signaling on the development of gastrointestinal motility disorders . Novel multiplex method to assess insulin , leptin and adiponectin regulation of inflammatory cytokines associated with colon cancer . The role of altered levels of insulin , leptin and adiponectin in contributing to the observed increased risk of colon cancer associated with obesity remains to be determined . Elevated insulin and leptin associated with obesity are linked to inflammatory responses . Conversely , adiponectin levels are reduced in obese individuals and this hormone is generally associated with anti-inflammatory responses . Inflammatory cytokines are key components of processes linked with carcinogenesis . P01308 , leptin and adiponectin receptor expression profiles were assessed in human normal , adenomatous polyp and tumour tissue . P01308 , leptin and adiponectin regulation of inflammatory cytokines previously identified as being associated with early events in colon carcinogenesis were further investigated here using a surrogate colon epithelial cell line and a custom designed GeXP assay of the inflammatory cytokines ( P78556 , P09341 , P19875 , P19876 , O14625 , P18510 , P02776 , P10145 , Q99731 , O00585 , P55773 , P13501 , Q08334 and P19438 ) . Mean insulin , leptin and adiponectin receptor expression levels were lower in adenomatous polyp samples in comparison with normal and tumour tissue . In contrast to leptin , insulin significantly reduced P78556 and O14625 and increased P19876 expression . Q8N1N2 length adiponectin , but not globular adiponectin , induced P13501 , P09341 , P19876 and P78556 gene expression . GeXP assay permitted measurement of changes in gene expression of cytokines in response to insulin and adiponectin , indicating the potential for insulin and adiponectin regulation of mediators of inflammation associated with early events in colon carcinogenesis . The diagnosis of fasting hypoglycemia due to an islet-cell tumor obscured by a highly specific insulin assay . The work-up of fasting hypoglycemia may be difficult but is crucially important because a wrong diagnosis can lead to either unnecessary pancreatectomy or a missed pancreatic tumor . We describe a patient with severe fasting hypoglycemia [ 22-32 mg/dl ( 1. P35326 .8 mmol/liter ) after 6-10 h of fasting ] in which the diagnosis of a secretory islet-cell tumor was obscured , rather than facilitated , by use of a new , highly specific serum insulin assay . P01308 measured by the specific assay suppressed normally during fasting hypoglycemia [ undetectable at < 2.0-3.8 micro IU/ml ( 26.4 pmol/liter ) ] , whereas insulin measured by older , less specific assays was diagnostically elevated [ 34 , 73 micro IU/ml ( 236.1 , 507.0 pmol/liter ) ] . Serum proinsulin and C-peptide levels were abnormal , and further work-up revealed an islet-cell tumor that secreted predominantly proinsulin . The tumor was surgically removed , relieving the fasting hypoglycemia . We conclude that insulin levels as measured by new , highly specific insulin assays may obscure the diagnosis of a functional , proinsulin-secreting islet-cell tumor . Because proinsulin cross-reacts with insulin in older insulin assays , C-peptide or proinsulin should be measured to rule out a proinsulin-secreting islet-cell tumor . Normative values for new insulin assays must be established during prolonged fasting . Potentiation of P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells by papaverine : role played by P98160 -γ , IP3 receptors . DB01113 , an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) 10A , is gaining attention for its potential in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia . However , the precise mechanisms underlying the putative neuroprotective/neurotrophic actions of papaverine remain unclear . Thus , we investigated the effects of papaverine on nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) -induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells . DB01113 potentiated P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner . In contrast , the selective Q9Y233 inhibitor MP-10 had no effect on P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth . The potentiation of P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth by papaverine was blocked by the P98160 -γ inhibitor U73122 . Furthermore , papaverine 's potentiation of P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth was also blocked by the co-administration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ( IP(3) ) receptor antagonists ( xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate ( 2- Q9H4A4 ) ) and by reduced expression of IP(3) receptor gene ( i.e. , itpr1 and itpr3 ) by siRNA . Our findings suggest that papaverine could potentiate P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth , and that activation of P98160 -γ and IP(3) receptors might be involved in the mechanism underlying papaverine 's potentiation of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells . DB03886 -dependent hyperphenylalaninemia due to deficiency of 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase . We describe the clinical , neurologic , and biochemical findings in 10 patients with 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase ( 6- Q03393 ) deficiency from seven families , all of whom originate from one large tribe in Saudi Arabia . This deficiency presents with severe , early onset of failure to thrive , neurologic deterioration , and morbidity and mortality secondary to repeated episodes of bronchopneumonia or cardiorespiratory abnormalities . The urinary pterin excretion pattern indicates deficient activity of 6- Q03393 , which has been confirmed by direct enzyme assay in red blood cells of three patients . We treated our patients with combined use of tetrahydrobiopterin 20 mg/kg/d , L-dihydroxyphenylalanine 15 mg/kg/d , carbidopa 3.75 mg/kg/d , and L-5-hydroxytryptophan 5 mg/kg/d . Neurologic findings improved significantly in all after 5 to 24 months . Although head circumference and weight returned to the lower limit of normal in four , height normalized only in one of seven patients . Despite an unrestricted diet during combined therapy , blood phenylalanine and urinary excretion of neopterin and biopterin returned to normal . [ Localization of pancreatic insulinomas by combined radiographic methods ] . Seventeen cases with a total of eighteen insulinomas were examined by ultrasonography ( US ) , computed tomography ( CT ) , angiography , percutaneous transhepatic portal and pancreatic venous sampling ( Q03393 ) and intraoperative ultrasonography ( IOUS ) . We discussed about diagnostic accuracy of insulinomas on these diagnostic modalities . Tumor localization was achieved by US in 39 % , CT in 72 % and angiography in 81 % . Although total 15 tumors ( 83 % ) can be correctly detected , multiple lesions were not completely ruled out . We recommended the criteria in Q03393 as follows : P01308 concentration level above 200 mu U/ml . Or , both of insulin concentration ratio ( step-up site/control ) above three and elevation of the P16435 concentration level on the Q03393 . According to these criteria , the accuracy rate was 91 % . Overall preoperative diagnostic accuracy was 100 % . IOUS allowed us to detect the localization of the tumors completely . DNA hypomethylation , transient neonatal diabetes , and prune belly sequence in one of two identical twins . One known genetic mechanism for transient neonatal diabetes is loss of methylation at 6q24 . The etiology of prune belly sequence is unknown but a genetic defect , affecting the mesoderm from which the triad abdominal muscle hypoplasia , urinary tract abnormalities , and cryptorchidism develop , has been suggested . We investigated a family , including one twin , with transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence . Autoantibody tests excluded type 1 diabetes . Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the twins being monozygotic . We identified no mutations in Q9NU63 , Q14654 , Q09428 , GCK , P20823 , P35680 , Q9Y261 , P52945 , O43316 , or O60481 . The proband had loss of methylation at the 6q24 locus TNDM and also at the loci P11717 , O95661 , and Q5EB52 , while the other family members , including the healthy monozygotic twin , had normal findings . The loss of methylation on chromosome 6q24 and elsewhere may indicate a generalized maternal hypomethylation syndrome , which accounts for both transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence . The PEPvIII-KLH ( DB05374 ) vaccine in glioblastoma multiforme patients . Conventional therapies for glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) fail to target tumor cells exclusively , resulting in non-specific toxicity . Immune targeting of tumor-specific mutations may allow for more precise eradication of neoplastic cells . P00533 variant III ( EGFRvIII ) is a tumor-specific mutation that is widely expressed in GBM and other neoplasms and its expression enhances tumorigenicity . This in-frame deletion mutation splits a codon , resulting in a novel glycine at the fusion junction producing a tumor-specific epitope target for cellular or humoral immunotherapy . We have previously shown that vaccination with a peptide that spans the EGFRvIII fusion junction ( PEPvIII-KLH/ DB05374 ) is an efficacious immunotherapy in syngeneic murine models . In this review , we summarize our results in GBM patients targeting this mutation in multiple , multi-institutional Phase II immunotherapy trials . These trials demonstrated that a selected population of GBM patients who received vaccines targeting EGFRvIII had an unexpectedly long survival time . Further therapeutic strategies and potential pitfalls of using this approach are discussed . P06401 modulator for emergency contraception : a randomized controlled trial . OBJECTIVE : Compare the efficacy and adverse effects of DB05366 , a new progesterone receptor modulator , to levonorgestrel for emergency contraception . METHODS : We performed a randomized , double-blinded noninferiority trial , enrolling healthy women seeking emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse . Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of 50 mg of DB05366 , plus a placebo 12 hours later or two doses of 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel taken 12 hours apart . Follow-up was scheduled 5 to 7 days after the expected onset of the next menstrual period . Posttreatment pregnancy was established by a positive urine test at follow-up and confirmed by quantitative serum beta-hCG . Daily diaries were used from the time of emergency contraception use until next menses to record adverse effects and sexual activity . RESULTS : Product efficacy was evaluable in 775 of DB05366 users and 774 of levonorgestrel users . Pregnancies occurred in 7 ( 0.9 % , 95 % confidence interval 0. P35326 .6 % ) and 13 ( 1.7 % , 95 % confidence interval 0.8-2.6 % ) women , respectively . Based on the estimated cycle day of unprotected intercourse , 85 % and 69 % of anticipated pregnancies , respectively , were averted . Nausea was reported by a somewhat greater percentage of DB05366 than levonorgestrel users ( 29 % compared with 24 % , P=.03 ) , but the distribution of other adverse effects was similar in both groups . Women in both groups experienced considerable variation in menstrual cycle length as compared with their reported individual normal cycle lengths . CONCLUSION : DB05366 is at least as effective as levonorgestrel in preventing pregnancies after unprotected intercourse and has a similar side effect profile . LEVEL OF EVIDENCE : I . P01308 secretory defects and impaired islet architecture in pancreatic beta-cell-specific P40763 knockout mice . Normal islet formation and function depends on the action of various growth factors operating in pre- and postnatal development ; however , the specific physiological function of each factor is largely unknown . Loss-of-function analyses in mice have provided little information so far , perhaps due to functional redundancies of the growth factors acting on the pancreas . The present study focuses on the role of the transcription factor P40763 in insulin-producing cells . P40763 is one of the potential downstream mediators for multiple growth factors acting on the pancreatic beta-cells , including betacellulin , hepatocyte growth factor , growth hormone , and heparin-binding P01133 -like growth factor . To elucidate its role in the beta-cells , the P40763 gene was disrupted in insulin-producing cells in mice ( P40763 -insKO ) , using a cre-mediated gene recombination approach . Unexpectedly , P40763 -insKO mice exhibited an increase in appetite and obesity at 8 weeks of age or older . The mice showed partial leptin resistance , suggesting that expression of the RIP ( rat insulin promoter ) -cre transgene in hypothalamus partially inhibited the appetite-regulating system . Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests , performed in non-obese 5-week-old mice , showed that the P40763 -insKO mice were glucose intolerant . Islet perifusion experiments further revealed a deficiency in early-phase insulin secretion . Whereas islet insulin content or islet mass was not affected , expression levels of P11168 , Q09428 , and P15692 were significantly reduced in P40763 -insKO islets . Interestingly , P40763 -insKO mice displayed impaired islet morphology : alpha-cells were frequently seen in central regions of islets . Our present observations demonstrate a unique role of P40763 in maintaining glucose-mediated early-phase insulin secretion and normal islet morphology . Serious obstetric complications interact with hypoxia-regulated/vascular-expression genes to influence schizophrenia risk . The etiology of schizophrenia is thought to include both epistasis and gene-environment interactions . We sought to test whether a set of schizophrenia candidate genes regulated by hypoxia or involved in vascular function in the brain ( P31749 , P23560 , O75052 , P36544 , P21964 , Q96EV8 , Q99259 , Q14832 , Q99466 , Q02297 , O43272 , P49798 , P01375 ) interacted with serious obstetric complications to influence risk for schizophrenia . A family-based study of transmission disequilibrium was conducted in 116 trios . Twenty-nine probands had at least one serious obstetric complication ( OC ) using the McNeil-Sjostrom Scale , and many of the OCs reported were associated with the potential for fetal hypoxia . Analyses were conducted using conditional logistic regression and a likelihood ratio test ( LRT ) between nested models was performed to assess significance . Of the 13 genes examined , four ( P31749 ( three SNPs ) , P23560 ( two SNPs ) , Q96EV8 ( one SNP ) and Q14832 ( one SNP ) ) showed significant evidence for gene-by-environment interaction ( LRT P-values ranged from 0.011 to 0.037 ) . Although our sample size was modest and the power to detect interactions was limited , we report significant evidence for genes involved in neurovascular function or regulated by hypoxia interacting with the presence of serious obstetric complications to increase risk for schizophrenia . P06401 modulator DB05366 down-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor , adrenomedullin and their receptors and modulates progesterone receptor content in cultured human uterine leiomyoma cells . BACKGROUND : This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of graded concentrations ( 10(-8) , 10(-7) and 10(-6) M ) of progesterone receptor ( PR ) modulator DB05366 on the protein contents of PR , of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , adrenomedullin ( P35318 ) and their receptors in cultured human uterine leiomyoma and matching myometrial cells . METHODS : PR-A , PR-B , P15692 , P49765 , P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , P35968 , P35318 and P35318 receptor ( O15218 ) contents were assessed by Western blot analysis . RESULTS : Treatment with 100 ng/ml progesterone increased P15692 , P49765 and P35318 contents in cultured leiomyoma cells and normal myometrial cells . The concomitant treatment with 10(-6) M DB05366 significantly decreased the progesterone-induced P15692 , P49765 and P35318 contents in cultured leiomyoma cells but not in normal myometrial cells . DB05366 treatment alone decreased P17948 , P35968 and O15218 contents in cultured leiomyoma cells but not in normal myometrial cells . DB05366 treatment increased PR-A and decreased PR-B contents in cultured leiomyoma cells in a dose-dependent manner compared with untreated cultures , whereas no significant changes in PR isoform contents were observed in normal myometrial cells . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that DB05366 down-regulates P15692 , P35318 and their receptor contents and modulates PR isoform contents in cultured leiomyoma cells in a cell-type-specific manner . A new approach in the study of the molecular and cellular events implicated in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia . Formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates . DB01109 -induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) , a relatively common complication of heparin therapy , results of platelet activation , via the receptor for the Fc domain of IgG ( FcgammaRIIa ) , by heparin-dependent-antibodies , commonly directed against the heparin-platelet factor 4 ( H- P02776 ) antigenic complex . Our strategy was to use whole blood allowing the study of leukocyte-platelet interactions . Experiments were performed with blood from healthy donors incubated with HIT patients ' plasma and different concentrations of heparin . We showed that 75 % of the HIT patients ' plasma induced the formation of leukocyte-platelet-aggregates in a heparin-dependent-manner . The formation of leukocyte-platelet-aggregates induced by HIT plasma in the presence of heparin was ( i ) independent of the healthy blood donor FcgammaRIIa polymorphism , ( ii ) correlated with the levels of anti H- P02776 IgG antibodies contained in the patients ' plasma , and to a lesser extent to anti H- P02776 IgM antibodies , and ( iii ) was mediated by P16109 . This report opens new prospects in the study of the molecular and cellular events implicated in HIT . DB01268 in the treatment of advanced solid tumors . DB01268 is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) alpha and beta , c-kit , and other receptors . These attributes have proven to be efficacious in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) , and well-differentiated advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( PNET ) . Though activity has been reported in other tumor types , phase III trials have not yet demonstrated improved survival outcomes in these cancers . Most side effects including hypertension , hand-foot syndrome , and diarrhea are generally well manageable . This review will detail the preclinical data leading up to the results of the pivotal phase III clinical trials that have led to the widespread use of sunitinib in advanced RCC , GIST , and PNET . [ Progress in locating the genetic causes of schizophrenia ] . Elucidation of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia is progressing rapidly . The importance of the glutamatergic system and the glutamate receptor Q14832 were shown in both genetic and pharmacological studies of the new drug DB05096 . The zinc finger domain-containing gene Q7Z570 could be identified as a new schizophrenia susceptibility gene , while large copy number variants at 1q21.1 and 15q13.3 now are seen as monogenic causes of schizophrenia . It is anticipated that the coming years will see further rapid progress in the unraveling of the causes of schizophrenia . Antithrombin replacement during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . DB01109 remains the predominant anticoagulant during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . DB01109 acts by potentiating the anticoagulant effect of antithrombin ( P01008 ) . Acquired P01008 deficiency , common in pediatric patients requiring ECMO , may result in ineffective anticoagulation with heparin . P01008 replacement may result in increased bleeding . Our objective is to determine P01008 's effect on anticoagulation and blood loss during ECMO . A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients at Children 's Hospital of Wisconsin who received P01008 while supported on ECMO in 2009 . P01008 activity levels , heparin drip rate , and activated clotting times ( ACT ) were compared before , 4 , 8 , and 24 h after P01008 administration . Chest tube output and packed red blood cell ( pRBC ) transfusion volume were compared from 24 h before P01008 administration to 24 h after . Twenty-eight patients received P01008 as a bolus dose during the course of 31 separate times on ECMO support . The median age of these patients was 0.3 years ( range 1 day-19.5 years ) . P01008 activity increased significantly at 8 and 24 h after administration . No significant difference was noted in heparin drip rate , ACT levels , chest tube output , or pRBC transfusion volume . P01008 administration resulted in higher P01008 activity levels for 24 h without a significant effect on heparin dose , ACT , or measures of bleeding . DB00171 -sensitive potassium channels ( K( DB00171 ) ) in retina : a key role for delayed ischemic tolerance . The objectives of the present study were to determine the localization of K( DB00171 ) channels in normal retina and to evaluate their potential roles in ischemic preconditioning ( IPC ) in a rat model of ischemia induced by increased intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Brown Norway rats were subjected to sublethal 3- , lethal 20- and 40-min ischemia and the functional recovery was evaluated using electroretinography . The time interval between ischemic insults ranged from 1 to 72 h . The effects of K( DB00171 ) channel blockade on IPC protection were studied by treatment with 0.01 % glipizide . IPC was mimicked by injection of K( DB00171 ) channel openers of 0.01 % (-)cromakalim or 0.01 % P1060 72 h before 20-min ischemia . Co-expression of K( DB00171 ) channel subunits Kir6.2/ Q09428 was observed in the retinal pigment epithelium , inner segments of photoreceptors , outer plexiform and ganglion cell layers and at the border of the inner nuclear layer . In contrast to a 20- or 40-min ischemia , a 3-min ischemia induced no alteration of the electroretinogram ( ERG ) and constituted the preconditioning stimulus . An ischemic challenge of 40 min in preconditioned rats induced impairment of retinal function . However , animals preconditioned 24 , 48 and 72 h before 20-min ischemia had a significant improvement of the ERG . (-)Cromakalim and P1060 mimicked the effect of IPC . DB01067 significantly suppressed the protective effects of preconditioning . In conclusion , activation of K( DB00171 ) channels plays an important role in the mechanism of preconditioning by enhancing the resistance of the retina against a severe ischemic insult . Differences in transcript levels of ABC transporters between pancreatic adenocarcinoma and nonneoplastic tissues . OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to evaluate transcript levels of all 49 human DB00171 -binding cassette transporters ( ABCs ) in one of the most drug-resistant cancers , namely , the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) . Association of ABCs levels with clinical-pathologic characteristics and P01116 mutation status was followed as well . METHODS : Tumors and adjacent nonneoplastic tissues were obtained from 32 histologically verified PDAC patients . The transcript profile of ABCs was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with a relative standard curve . P01116 mutations in exon 2 were assessed by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing . RESULTS : Most ABCs were deregulated in PDAC and 10 ABCs were associated with clinical-pathologic characteristics . P01116 mutations did not change the global expression profile of ABCs . CONCLUSIONS : The expression of ABC transporters was significantly deregulated in PDAC tumors when compared to nonmalignant tissues . The observed up-regulation of P21439 , O95342 , P33527 , O15438 , O15440 , Q5T3U5 , and Q9UNQ0 in tumors may contribute to the generally poor treatment response of PDAC . The up-regulation of O95477 , Q8IZY2 , and P45844 implicates a serious impairment of cellular cholesterol homeostasis in PDAC . On the other hand , the observed down-regulation of Q99758 , O95255 , P13569 , and Q09428 suggests a possible role of stem cells in the development and progression of PDAC . C. elegans vulval development as a model system to study the cancer biology of P00533 signaling . Molecular genetic studies of C. elegans vulval development have helped to define an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway from an P01133 -like ligand through P01133 -receptor , Ras and Q96HU1 kinase to the nucleus . Further studies have identified novel positive regulators such as Q8IVT5 -1 and Q09428 -8/ Q5T124 -2 and negative regulators such as cbl/SLI-1 . The many negative regulatory proteins might serve to prevent inappropriate signaling , and thus are analogous to tumor suppressor genes . Characterization of bortezomib-adapted I-45 mesothelioma cells . BACKGROUND : DB00188 , a proteasome-specific inhibitor , has emerged as a promising cancer therapeutic agent . However , development of resistance to bortezomib may pose a challenge to effective anticancer therapy . Therefore , characterization of cellular mechanisms involved in bortezomib resistance and development of effective strategies to overcome this resistance represent important steps in the advancement of bortezomib-mediated cancer therapy . RESULTS : The present study reports the development of I-45-BTZ-R , a bortezomib-resistant cell line , from the bortezomib-sensitive mesothelioma cell line I-45 . I-45-BTZ-R cells showed no cross-resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin , 5-fluorouracil , and doxorubicin . Moreover , the bortezomib-adapted I-45-BTZ-R cells had decreased growth kinemics and did not over express proteasome subunit beta5 ( P28074 ) as compared to parental I-45 cells . I-45-BTZ-R cells and parental I-45 cells showed similar inhibition of proteasome activity , but I-45-BTZ-R cells exhibited much less accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins following exposure to 40 nm bortezomib . Further studies revealed that relatively low doses of bortezomib did not induce an unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in the bortezomib-adapted cells , while higher doses induced UPR with concomitant cell death , as evidenced by higher expression of the mitochondrial chaperone protein Bip and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress-related pro-apoptotic protein P35638 . In addition , bortezomib exposure did not induce the accumulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins p53 , Mcl-1S , and noxa in the bortezomib-adapted cells . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that UPR evasion , together with reduced pro-apoptotic gene induction , accounts for bortezomib resistance in the bortezomib-adapted mesothelioma cell line I-45-BTZ-R .
Gossypin up-regulates P01130 through activation of P29323 pathway : a signaling mechanism for the hypocholesterolemic effect . Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease . This study aims to elucidate the effect of gossypin on cholesterol metabolism in HepG2 cells . Results indicated that gossypin significantly reduced the total cholesterol concentration in a dose-dependent manner . There was a time- and dose-dependent increase in the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor ( P01130 ) protein . However , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase , the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis , was not affected by gossypin . Moreover , gossypin had no effect on nuclear sterol regulatory element binding proteins ( SREBP ) -2 abundance . The activity of gossypin on P01130 expression was inhibited by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) inhibitor PD98059 . Western blotting analysis revealed that gossypin treatment dose- and time-dependently increased P29323 activation and preceded the up-regulation of P01130 expression . Collectively , these new findings identify gossypin as a new hypocholesterolemic agent that up-regulates P01130 expression independent of Q12772 but is dependent on P29323 activation . DB01076 Increases P17813 , Q15796 , Phosphorylated Q15796 /3 and P29474 Expression in ApoE/ P01130 Double Knockout Mice . AIM : P17813 is a homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to affect transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) signaling and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) expression by affecting SMAD proteins in vitro . Thus , in this study we stepped forward to elucidate whether endoglin is co-expressed with Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 proteins and P29474 in vivo in atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE/ P01130 double knockout mice . In addition , we sought whether endoglin expression as well as the expression of Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 and P29474 is affected by atorvastatin treatment . METHODS : Two-month-old female ApoE/ P01130 double knockout mice were divided into two groups . The control group was fed with the western type diet whereas in the atorvastatin group , atorvastatin at dose 100 mg/kg per day was added to the same diet . Immunohistochemical and western blot analysis of endoglin , Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 and P29474 expressions in aorta were performed . RESULTS : The biochemical analysis showed that administration of atorvastatin significantly decreased level of total cholesterol , VLDL , LDL , TAG , and significantly increased level of HDL cholesterol . Fluorescence immunohistochemistry showed endoglin co-expression with Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 and P29474 in aortic endothelium covering atherosclerotic lesions in both control and atorvastatin treated mice . Western blot analysis demonstrated that atorvastatin significantly increased expression of endoglin , Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 , and P29474 in mice aorta . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest , that endoglin might be interesting marker of endothelial dysfunction and/or atherogenesis which is upregulated by statins implicating potential beneficial role of endoglin and its pathway in atherosclerosis . P01308 / P05019 signaling pathways enhances tumor cell invasion through bisecting GlcNAc N-glycans modulation . an interplay with P12830 . Changes in glycosylation are considered a hallmark of cancer , and one of the key targets of glycosylation modifications is P12830 . We and others have previously demonstrated that P12830 has a role in the regulation of bisecting GlcNAc N-glycans expression , remaining to be determined the P12830 -dependent signaling pathway involved in this N-glycans expression regulation . In this study , we analysed the impact of P12830 expression in the activation profile of receptor tyrosine kinases such as insulin receptor ( IR ) and P08069 ( IGF-IR ) . We demonstrated that exogenous P12830 expression inhibits IR , IGF-IR and P29323 1/2 phosphorylation . Stimulation with insulin and P05019 in MDA-MD-435 cancer cells overexpressing P12830 induces a decrease of bisecting GlcNAc N-glycans that was accompanied with alterations on P12830 cellular localization . Concomitantly , IR/IGF-IR signaling activation induced a mesenchymal-like phenotype of cancer cells together with an increased tumor cell invasion capability . Altogether , these results demonstrate an interplay between P12830 and IR/IGF-IR signaling as major networking players in the regulation of bisecting N-glycans expression , with important effects in the modulation of epithelial characteristics and tumor cell invasion . Here we provide new insights into the role that P01308 / P05019 signaling play during cancer progression through glycosylation modifications . Effects of a Topical Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and a Selective P35354 Inhibitor on the Prevention of Hypertrophic Scarring in the Skin of a Rabbit Ear . ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ P12821 ( P12821 ) inhibitors have been reported to inhibit fibrogenesis , and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors , to reduce scarring by reducing the initial inflammation . The authors reasoned that the topical application of these 2 agents may have a complementary effect on scar reduction . METHODS : DB01197 ( P12821 inhibitor ) , celecoxib ( P35354 inhibitor ) , or a combination of captopril and celecoxib were topically applied to a skin wound in a rabbit ear , and investigated for the effects on scar formation . RESULTS : The level of scar elevation decreased in the captopril group and the level of infiltration of inflammatory cells decreased in the celecoxib group . In the group where a combination of the 2 drugs was used , the level of scar elevation decreased the most , and collagen deposition and organization returned to normal most rapidly . Celecoxib was found to inhibit the initial inflammation in the ear wound of the rabbit , and captopril inhibited scar elevation . CONCLUSION : Clinical application of these drugs will require further studies with regard to adverse events and their absorptivity as topical agents . However , these findings suggest that the combined topical administration of an P12821 inhibitor and P35354 inhibitor to a skin wound could be an effective treatment for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring. ﻿﻿﻿ . P78347 enhances activation of the c-fos promoter through interactions with upstream elements . The transcription factor P78347 was initially isolated as a factor that can bind to initiator elements in core promoters . Recent evidence suggests that P78347 may also have a role in signal transduction . We have found that overexpression of P78347 can enhance the response of the wild-type c-fos promoter to a variety of stimuli . This effect depends on the c-fos DB00102 -platelet-derived growth factor-inducible factor binding element ( SIE ) and serum response element ( SRE ) . There is no effect of cotransfected P78347 on the TATA box containing the c-fos basal promoter . Three P78347 binding sites can be found in c-fos promoter . Two of these overlap the c-fos SIE and SRE , and another is located just upstream of the TATA box . Mutations that distinguish between serum response factor ( P11831 ) , P35610 , and P78347 binding to the c-fos SIE and SRE suggest that the binding of P78347 to these elements is important for c-fos induction in conjunction with the P11831 and P35610 transcription factors . Moreover , P78347 can form in vivo protein-protein complexes with the c-fos upstream activators P11831 , P42224 , and P40763 . These results suggest that P78347 may mediate the functional interdependence of the c-fos SIE and SRE elements . In addition , the ras pathway is required for P78347 to exert its effects on the c-fos promoter , and growth factor stimulation enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of P78347 . These results indicate that P78347 is involved in signal transduction as well as transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter . P08235 antagonism in the treatment of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy : a pilot study . PURPOSE : Based on experimental data showing that central serous chorioretinopathy could result from overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in choroid vessels , the authors studied eplerenone , a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist , as a potential treatment for chronic central serous chorioretinopathy . METHODS : This nonrandomized pilot study included 13 patients with central serous chorioretinopathy of at least 4-month duration , treated with 25 mg/day of oral eplerenone for a week followed by 50 mg/day for 1 or 3 months . The primary outcome measure was the changes in central macular thickness recorded by optical coherence tomography , and the secondary outcomes included changes in foveal subretinal fluid ( P11831 ) measured by O75051 , in best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) and the percentage of eyes achieving complete resolution of subretinal fluid during the treatment period . RESULTS : Central macular thickness decreased significantly from 352 ± 139 μm at baseline to 246 ± 113 μm and 189 ± 99 μm at 1 and 3 months under eplerenone treatment ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 , respectively ) . At 3 months , the subretinal fluid significantly decreased compared with baseline subretinal fluid ( P < 0.01 ) and best-corrected visual acuity significantly improved compared with baseline best-corrected visual acuity ( P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSION : DB00700 treatment was associated with a significant reduction in central macular thickness , subretinal fluid level , and an improvement in visual acuity . Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these encouraging results . DB01197 reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor activity in patients with acute myocardial infarction . Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors to patients with myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction . It has also been reported that an elevated level of plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) appears to constitute a marker of the risk of recurrent coronary thrombosis . To determine whether the P12821 inhibitor captopril reduces plasma P05121 inhibitor activity , we measured changes in plasma P05121 activity ( IU/ml ) , tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) antigen ( ng/ml ) , and serum P12821 activity ( IU/L ) in 14 survivors of myocardial infarction receiving captopril therapy ( 37.5 mg daily ) and compared them with the values in 15 placebo-treated patients chosen at random . Blood sampling was performed at 07.00 h . In the captopril-treated group , serum P12821 activity decreased significantly , from 14.0 +/- 0.8 to 11.5 +/- 1.2 IU/L 24 h after captopril therapy ( p < 0.01 ) , and those of P05121 activity and t-PA antigen also decreased significantly-from 11.9 +/- 2.8 to 5.5 +/- 2.2 IU/ml ( p < 0.02 ) and from 9.9 +/- 1.0 to 7.5 +/- 0.9 ng/ml ( p < 0.05 ) , respectively 48 h after captopril therapy . However , the levels of P12821 activity , P05121 activity , and t-PA antigen remained unchanged during the study period in the placebo group . Thus , our data indicate that the administration of captopril to patients with acute myocardial infarction may result in a reduced frequency of recurrent coronary thrombosis by increasing fibrinolytic capacity . Distinct functional properties of native somatostatin receptor subtype 5 compared with subtype 2 in the regulation of DB01285 release by corticotroph tumor cells . In a series of human corticotroph adenomas , we recently found predominant mRNA expression of somatostatin ( SS ) receptor subtype 5 ( sst5 ) . After 72 h , the multiligand SS analog DB06663 , which has a very high sst5 binding affinity , but not DB00104 ( O75051 ) , significantly inhibited basal DB01285 release . To further explore the role of sst5 in the regulation of DB01285 release , we conducted additional studies with mouse AtT-20 cells . DB06663 showed a 7-fold higher ligand binding affinity and a 19-fold higher potency in stimulating guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding in AtT-20 cell membranes compared with O75051 . DB06663 potently suppressed P06850 -induced DB01285 release , which was not affected by 48-h dexamethasone ( DEX ) pretreatment . However , DEX attenuated the inhibitory effects of O75051 on DB01285 release , whereas it increased the inhibitory potency of O43521 -23268 , an sst5-specific analog , on DB01285 release . Quantitative PCR analysis showed that DEX lowered sst(2A+2B) mRNA expression significantly after 24 and 48 h , whereas sst5 mRNA levels were not significantly affected by DEX treatment . Moreover , Scatchard analyses showed that DEX suppressed maximum binding capacity ( B(max) ) by 72 % when 125I-Tyr3-labeled O75051 was used as radioligand , whereas B(max) declined only by 17 % when AtT-20 cells were treated with [125I-Tyr11]SS-14 . These data suggest that the sst5 protein , compared with sst2 , is more resistant to glucocorticoids . Finally , after SS analog preincubation , compared with O75051 both DB06663 and O43521 -23268 showed a significantly higher inhibitory effect on P06850 -induced DB01285 release . In conclusion , our data support the concept that the sst5 receptor might be a target for new therapeutic agents to treat Cushing 's disease . Inhibition of cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 by the phospholipase-blocker , arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone ( Q06187 ) is widely used as an inhibitor of cytosolic group IV phospholipase A(2) ( cPLA(2) ) and calcium-independent group VI phospholipase A(2) ( iPLA(2) ) . Q06187 thus reduces arachidonic acid ( AA ) substrate for cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ; also known as prostaglandin H synthase ) and attenuates prostaglandin ( PG ) synthesis . It has been shown previously , that Q06187 blocks thromboxane B(2) production induced by exogenous AA in human platelets . It remains , however , unknown whether Q06187 also directly modulates the activity of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : Time courses for inhibition of P36551 by Q06187 was obtained using osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells , with exogenous AA as substrate and the pure enzymes P23219 and P35354 . PGE(2) was measured by GC-MS . KEY RESULTS : Q06187 was a potent inhibitor of P23219 and P35354 with IC(50) values of 0.5 and 0.1 microM in MC3T3-E1 cells and of 1.7 and 2.6 microM using the pure enzymes . Inhibition was reversible , with slow- and tight-binding characteristics . The arachidonyl carbon chain was essential , as the saturated palmitoyl analogue had no effect . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : Attenuation of PG synthesis by Q06187 is taken to be the consequence of PLA(2) inhibition and the findings of many studies are interpreted on that basis . If there are , however , alternative routes for AA liberation ( such as phospholipase C/diacyl glycerol lipase or phospholipase D ) , this interpretation can lead to false conclusions . As Q06187 is a widely used and important pharmacological tool in eicosanoid research , knowledge of its interactions with other major enzymes of the cascade is of considerable importance . Zeranol upregulates corticotropin releasing hormone expression in the placental cell line JEG-3 . DB01285 -releasing hormone ( P06850 ) plays a pivotal role in the control of parturition in human . Increased amount of plasma P06850 is associated with pre-mature delivery . Zeranol or α-zearalanol is a mycotoxin produced by fungi in the Fusarium family . Unlike other mycotoxins , exposure to zeranol appears to have minimal health risk . In North America , it is used as a growth-promoting agent in livestock . Because of the health concern of zeranol residue in meat , this practice has not been adopted in Europe . In our study zeranol could induce P06850 protein expression in JEG-3 cells as low as 0.1nM . As electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated an increase in the CRE binding activity in P06850 promoter , the induction was likely triggered by transcriptional regulation . We further looked into the signal transduction pathway and PKCδ and P27361 /2 were found to be activated . This study showed that zeranol could increase P06850 expression in placental cells , and the findings might be a concern for pregnant women . [ DB00707 sodium ( Photofrin-II ) ] . DB00707 sodium ( DB00707 ) is a photosensitizer which distributes selectively to tumor tissues , and causes tumor cell death by combination with light irradiation . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) by combination of porfimer sodium and laser was developed as a new cancer therapy . Tumor selectivity of porfimer sodium are based on the following reasons ; 1 ) high affinity for lipoprotein , especially , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , 2 ) elevation of P01130 activity in cancer tissue , and 3 ) lack or imcompleteness of lymphatic system in cancer tissue . DB00707 sodium is activated by laser irradiation at 630 nm , which can reacts with tissue oxygen to produce highly reactive excited siglet oxygen ( 1O2 ) . This highly reactive molecule is subsequently capable of killing tumor cells through oxidation of cellular component like mitochondrial enzymes . In addition , this highly reactive intermediate causes destruction of the tumor capillaries , which accelerates tumor cell death . The growth suppression or lethal damage to tumor cells by PDT of porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser were observed in experimental tumor models . In human clinical trials , the rates of complete response ( CR ) for roentgenographically occult lung cancer , stage I lung cancer , superficial esophageal cancer , superficial gastric cancer and carcinoma in situ or dysplasia of the cervix were 84.8 % , 50.0 % , 90.0 % , 87.5 % and 94.4 % , respectively . The major side effects were cutaneous symptoms e.g. photosensitivity , pigmentation , increasing GOT , GPT but these symptoms were not severe . PDT using porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser must be clinically useful for the treatment of inoperable early cancer or conservation of organ functions . Paraoxonase-1 activity affects the clopidogrel response in P33261 loss-of-function carriers . BACKGROUND : The impact of paraoxonase-1 ( P27169 ) activity on the response to clopidogrel may differ in patients treated with drug-eluting stents ( DES ) in association with P33261 loss-of-function ( LOF ) polymorphisms . METHODS : This study included 112 Japanese patients receiving clopidogrel ( 75 mg/day ) and aspirin ( 100mg/day ) who underwent optical coherence tomography ( O75051 ) examination 9 months after DES implantation . The P33261 genotype was analyzed and LOF carriers ( 1/2 , 1/3 , 2/2 , 3/3 , 2/3 ) were identified . At the 9-month follow-up , platelet reactivity was determined by measuring the Q9H244 reactivity unit ( PRU ) using a VerifyNow Q9H244 assay , P27169 activity was evaluated and intra-stent thrombus was evaluated by O75051 . RESULTS : Of the 112 Japanese patients , 75 were LOF carriers ( 67.0 % ) . The patients were divided into tertiles according to the P27169 activity ( tertile 1 ; < 230 U/L , tertile 2 ; 230-283U/L , tertile 3 ; > 283 U/L ) . In the VerifyNowP2Y12 analysis , tertile 1 had a higher PRU than tertiles 2 and 3 in LOF carriers , and there was no difference among tertiles in non-carriers . The highest incidence of intra-stent thrombus was observed in tertile 1 followed by tertiles 2 and 3 in LOF carriers , whereas there was no such difference in non-carriers . Multivariate analysis revealed that LOF carriers and P27169 activity tertile 1 were independent predictors of intra-stent thrombus in all patients . In LOF carriers , tertile 1 was the only independent predictor for intra-stent thrombus . CONCLUSION : Low P27169 activity is associated with a low response to clopidogrel and a high frequency of intra-stent thrombus only in LOF carriers . DB09053 inhibits P11274 and NF-κB signaling and reduces tumor proliferation in tissue-resident cells of patients with CLL . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells depend on microenvironmental factors for proliferation and survival . In particular , tissue-resident CLL cells show prominent activation of both B-cell receptor ( P11274 ) and NF-κB pathways . We evaluated the in vivo effects of ibrutinib , a Q06187 ( Q06187 ) inhibitor on tumor cell activation and proliferation in the blood , lymph node , and bone marrow of patients with CLL . Applying validated pathway-specific gene signatures , we detected a rapid and sustained downregulation of P11274 and NF-κB signaling in CLL cells from both the peripheral blood and tissue compartments during ibrutinib treatment . DB09053 reduced phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and P29323 and decreased nuclear protein expression of NF-κB p50 . DB09053 significantly decreased tumor proliferation and expression of surface activation markers Q07108 and P42081 , independent of prognostic factors such as IGHV mutational status , chromosome 17p deletion , or prior treatment history . Interestingly , stronger inhibition of P11274 signaling in lymph node resident CLL cells after one dose of ibrutinib was associated with a higher rate of nodal response at the end of cycle 2 . Together , these data validate on-target effects of Q06187 inhibition in the tissue compartments and demonstrate that ibrutinib effectively inhibits pathways that promote tumor cell activation and proliferation in vivo . This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT01500733 . Prasugrel : a new antiplatelet drug for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease . Prasugrel , trade name DB06209 , is an investigational new antiplatelet drug currently under review for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration . It is a thienopyridine analog with a structure similar to that of clopidogrel and ticlopidine . Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate by irreversibly inhibiting the binding of adenosine diphosphate to the purinergic Q9H244 receptor on the platelet surface . Prasugrel has been shown to be a potent antiplatelet agent with a faster , more consistent , and greater inhibition of platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel . It is debatable , however , how effectively these pharmacologic benefits will translate to clinical benefits . The results of the large TRITON-TIMI 38 trial , which compared prasugrel and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were scheduled to receive coronary stents , demonstrated a significant reduction in ischemic events , including stent thrombosis , with prasugrel , but with an increased risk of major bleeding . The exact role of prasugrel in the management of ischemic heart disease is still being defined , but the risk:benefit ratio will likely play a major role in directing the best place for therapy with this new agent . Structure of the human Q9H244 receptor in complex with an antithrombotic drug . P2Y receptors ( P2YRs ) , a family of purinergic G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , are activated by extracellular nucleotides . There are a total of eight distinct functional P2YRs expressed in human , which are subdivided into P47900 -like receptors and Q9H244 -like receptors . Their ligands are generally charged molecules with relatively low bioavailability and stability in vivo , which limits our understanding of this receptor family . P2Y12R regulates platelet activation and thrombus formation , and several antithrombotic drugs targeting P2Y12R -- including the prodrugs clopidogrel ( Plavix ) and prasugrel ( DB06209 ) that are metabolized and bind covalently , and the nucleoside analogue ticagrelor ( DB08816 ) that acts directly on the receptor -- have been approved for the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction . However , limitations of these drugs ( for example , a very long half-life of clopidogrel action and a characteristic adverse effect profile of ticagrelor ) suggest that there is an unfulfilled medical need for developing a new generation of P2Y12R inhibitors . Here we report the 2.6 Å resolution crystal structure of human P2Y12R in complex with a non-nucleotide reversible antagonist , AZD1283 . The structure reveals a distinct straight conformation of helix V , which sets P2Y12R apart from all other known class A GPCR structures . With AZD1283 bound , the highly conserved disulphide bridge in GPCRs between helix III and extracellular loop 2 is not observed and appears to be dynamic . Along with the details of the AZD1283-binding site , analysis of the extracellular interface reveals an adjacent ligand-binding region and suggests that both pockets could be required for dinucleotide binding . The structure provides essential insights for the development of improved P2Y12R ligands and allosteric modulators as drug candidates . Genotype frequencies of 50 polymorphisms for 241 Japanese non-cancer patients . This paper lists the genotype frequencies of 50 polymorphisms of 37 genes ( P05091 , P07550 , P13945 , P21964 , P16671 , P25025 , P24385 , P35354 , P11509 , P05093 , P11511 , IGF1 , IL-1A , IL-1B , IL-1RN , IL-1R1 , P05231 , P10145 , P22301 , P41159 , Le , L-myc , P05164 , Q99707 , P42898 , P21397 , P15559 , O15527 , p53 , p73 , Se , P31213 , TGF-B , P01375 -A , P01375 -B , P18074 , and P18887 ) and 6 sets of combined genotype frequencies for 241 non-cancer Japanese outpatients . Though the genotype frequencies of 25 polymorphisms have already been reported in our previous papers , 15 polymorphisms ( P16671 A52C , P25025 C785T , P24385 G870A , IGF1 C/T at intron 2 and G2502T , IL-1A 46-bp VNTR , IL-1R1 C-116T , P05231 Ins/Del 17C , P10145 A-278T and C74T , IL- 10 T-819C , P41159 A-2548G , P31213 2-bp VNTR , P18074 Lys751Gln , and P18887 Arg399Gln ) and six sets of combined genotype frequencies ( IL-1B C-31T and IL-1A C-889T , IL-1B C-31T and IL-1RN 86-bp VNTR , IL-1B C-31T and IL-1R1 C-116T , P01375 -A G-308A and P01375 -B A252G , P31213 Val89Leu and 2-bp VNTR , and P18887 Arg399Gln and P18074 Lys751Gln ) were reported in this paper for the first time for Japanese . Although microarray technology will produce this kind of information in near future , this is the first document that reports the genotype/allele frequencies among Japanese for an archival purpose . Stimulation of epithelial repair is a likely mechanism for the action of mifepristone in reducing duration of bleeding in users of progestogen-only contraceptives . Many women using progestogen ( P ) -only contraceptives experience uterine bleeding problems . In clinical trials , a single low dose of mifepristone , given to DB00294 users at the beginning of a bleeding episode reduced the number of bleeding days by approximately 50 % compared with controls . In this study , a single dose of mifepristone was administered to etonogestrel ( P17813 ) -exposed pseudo-pregnant mice , 5 days after artificial decidualization was induced when the endometrium showed signs of bleeding . Control mice received vehicle alone . Mice were culled 12- , 18- , 24- and 48-h post-treatment . In the continued presence of P17813 , a single dose of mifepristone stimulated tissue breakdown followed by very rapid repair : most treated tissues were fully restored to the pre-decidualized state by 48 h post-treatment . During repair , proliferating cells ( Ki67 immunostained ) were localized to a band of cells around the basal area in breaking down tissues and to the repairing luminal epithelium and glands . P06401 -positive cells were largely localized to the basal area of the breaking down tissue in treated mice compared with decidual cells in controls . Oestrogen receptor-positive cells were observed in the repairing luminal epithelium and glands compared with the decidua and the basal region in control tissues . It is concluded that mifepristone treatment stimulates rapid restoration of luminal epithelial integrity : such action may be a key event in reducing the number of bleeding days observed in women using DB00294 who were treated with a single dose of mifepristone . Altered expression of beta-catenin , P12830 , cycloxygenase-2 , and p53 protein by ovine intestinal adenocarcinoma cells . Around 1.6 % of sheep in New Zealand develop small-intestinal adenocarcinomas . These neoplasms typically develop widespread metastases . The common development of these neoplasms and their subsequent behavior suggests that sheep could be a useful animal model of human colonic cancer . However , for an animal model of human disease to be relevant , similar genetic mutations should be present . Genetic mutations within human colonic cancers frequently result in expression of cycloxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , loss of membranous expression of beta-catenin and P12830 , and accumulation of p53 protein within the neoplastic cells . Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the presence of these 4 proteins within 26 ovine intestinal adenocarcinomas . Loss of membranous beta-catenin reactivity was observed in 14 of 26 ovine intestinal adenocarcinomas ( 54 % ) . The loss of membranous beta-catenin reactivity was accompanied by cytoplasmic and nuclear reactivity in 2 neoplasms . Loss of P12830 was observed within 8 of 26 neoplasms ( 31 % ) . Neoplastic cell expression of P35354 was observed in 12 of 26 neoplasms ( 46 % ) , whereas cells within 3 of 26 neoplasms ( 11 % ) contained visible p53 protein . In conclusion , all 4 proteins that commonly have altered expression in human colonic cancers were also altered in a proportion of the ovine intestinal adenocarcinomas . These results provide additional evidence that sheep could be useful for the study of human colonic cancer . Characterization of the aggregation responses of camel platelets . BACKGROUND : Despite evidence of active hemostasis , camel platelets barely respond to common aggregating agents at standard doses used for human platelet aggregation . OBJECTIVES : The purpose of the study was to find out whether camel platelets can be activated by high doses or combinations of aggregation agonists , and to characterize the receptor that mediates the aggregation response to adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , the most potent agonist for camel platelets known so far . METHODS : Aggregation studies were performed with platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) in response to multiple doses or combinations of ADP , epinephrine ( P08473 ) , collagen , and arachidonic acid ( AA ) . Aggregation responses to ADP were performed before and after the addition of the ADP receptor ( Q9H244 ) antagonist DB00758 . RESULTS : Camel platelets responded to ADP at doses higher than the standard dose for human platelets , and to combinations of P08473 and other agonists , while no aggregation was elicited with P08473 or AA alone . DB00758 blocked the ADP-induced aggregation responses in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro . CONCLUSIONS : Camel platelet aggregation can be activated by increasing the dose of some agonists such as ADP , but not AA or P08473 . Irreversible aggregation of camel platelets could also be triggered by a combination of P08473 and ADP , and collagen and AA . Inhibition with clopidogrel suggests that camel platelets express the ADP receptor , Q9H244 . Understanding platelet function in camels will add to the understanding of platelet function in health and disease . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) sparing effects of glucosamine hydrochloride through N-glycosylation inhibition ; strategy to rescue stomach from NSAID damage . Gastrointestinal or cardiovascular complications limit nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) prescription . DB01296 hydrochloride ( GS-HCl ) alternatively chosen , but debates still exist in its clinical efficiency . P35354 instability through inhibiting P35354 N-glycosylation of GS-HCl raised the possibility of NSAID sparing effect . Study was done to determine whether combination treatment of glucosamine and NSAID contributes to gastric safety through NSAID sparing effect . IEC-6 cells were stimulated with P01375 -α and compared the expressions of inflammatory mediators after indomethacin alone or combination of indomethacin and GS-HCl by Western blotting and RT-PCR . C57BL/6 mice injected with type II collagen to induce arthritis were treated with indomethacin alone or combination of reduced dose of indomethacin and GS-HCl after 3 weeks . P01375 -α increased the expression of P35354 , P35228 and inflammatory cytokines , but GS-HCl significantly attenuated P01375 -α-induced P35354 expression . Decreased P35354 after GS-HCl was caused by N-glycosylation inhibition as much as tunicamycin . Combination of reduced dose of indomethacin and GS-HCl significantly reduced the expressions of P05362 , P19320 , P10145 , IL-1β , P08253 , P09237 , P14780 , and P24347 mRNA as well as NF-κB activation better than high dose indomethacin alone . These NSAID sparing effect of GS-HCl was further proven in collagen-induced arthritis model . Combination of GS-HCl and 2.5 mg/kg indomethacin showed significant protection from gastric damages as well as efficacious anti-arthritic effect . Taken together , P35354 N-glycosylation inhibition by GS-HCl led to indomethacin sparing effects , based on which combination of GS-HCl and reduced dose of NSAID can provide the strategy to secure stomach from NSAID-induced gastric damage as well as excellent anti-arthritic effects . Gender difference in the activity but not expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in human lung adenocarcinoma cells . The higher frequency of lung adenocarcinoma in women smokers than in men smokers suggests a role for gender-dependent factors in the etiology of lung cancer . We evaluated estrogen receptor ( ER ) alpha and beta expression and activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and normal lung fibroblasts . Q8N1N2 -length ERalpha and ERbeta proteins were expressed in all cell lines with higher ERbeta than ERalpha . Although estradiol ( E(2) ) binding was similar , E(2) stimulated proliferation only in cells from females , and this response was inhibited by anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( DB04468 ) and DB00947 . In contrast , E(2) did not stimulate replication of lung adenocarcinoma cells from males and DB04468 or ICI did not block cell proliferation . Similarly , transcription of an estrogen response element-driven reporter gene was stimulated by E(2) in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females , but not males . P06401 ( PR ) expression was increased by E(2) in two out of five adenocarcinoma cell lines from females , but none from males . E(2) decreased P12830 protein expression in some of the cell lines from females , as it did in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , but not in the cell lines from males . Thus , ERalpha and ERbeta expression does not correlate with the effect of ER ligands on cellular activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells . On the other hand , coactivator Q15648 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females versus males and higher in adenocarcinoma cells than in normal human bronchial epithelial cells . Q15648 and other ER coregulators may contribute to differences in estrogen responsiveness between lung adenocarcinoma cells in females and males . Role of cardiovascular aldosterone in hypertension . DB04630 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease . We have reported that aldosterone is synthesized in cardiovascular tissues and local aldosterone synthesis plays important roles for hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy . High sodium intake develops and accelerates vascular injury and cardiac hypertrophy in SHRSP . Plasma aldosterone concentrations and P06703 were decreased by high salt intake in SHRSP . DB04630 production , the expression of P19099 mRNA and angiotensin II receptor AT1R mRNA in blood vessels were significantly increased by high salt intake . These results suggest that high salt intake increases aldosterone production and expression of the AT1R mRNA in the vascular tissue in SHRSP , which may contribute to the development of malignant hypertension in salt-loaded SHRSP . However , there are several reports of conflicting data . P08235 ( MR ) binding is tightly regulated by the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 ( 11beta-HSD2 ) which selectively metabolizes glucocorticoids to inactive metabolites , thus allowing for MR activation by aldosterone . We have reported that decreased 11beta-HSD2 in blood vessels in Dahl salt-sensitive ( DS ) rats , a model for salt-sensitive hypertension . Local aldosterone excess may play a significant role in the salt sensitivity and development of hypertension . High sodium intake decreased circulating rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and increased blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in DS rats , which were prevented by the treatment with a selective MR antagonist , eplerenone . DB00700 also improved endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) activity and P29474 mRNA expression in blood vessels in DS rats . These results further suggest that not only circulating aldosterone but also local aldosterone is of critical importance in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders . The sulphydryl containing P12821 inhibitor Zofenoprilat protects coronary endothelium from Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis . Pediatric and adult cancer patients , following the use of the antitumor drug Doxorubicin develop cardiotoxicity . Pharmacological protection of microvascular endothelium might produce a double benefit : ( i ) reduction of myocardial toxicity ( the primary target of Doxorubicin action ) and ( ii ) maintenance of the vascular functionality for the adequate delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells . This study was aimed to evaluate the mechanisms responsible of the protective effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) Zofenoprilat against the toxic effects exerted by Doxorubicin on coronary microvascular endothelium . We found that exposure of endothelial cells to Doxorubicin ( 0.1-1μM range ) impaired cell survival by promoting their apoptosis . P27361 /2 related p53 activation , but not reactive oxygen species , was responsible for Doxorubicin induced caspase-3 cleavage . P04637 mediated-apoptosis and impairment of survival were reverted by treatment with Zofenoprilat . The previously described PI-3K/ P29474 /endogenous fibroblast growth factor signaling was not involved in the protective effect , which , instead , could be ascribed to cystathionine gamma lyase dependent availability of H2S from Zofenoprilat . Furthermore , considering the tumor environment , the treatment of endothelial/tumor co-cultures with Zofenoprilat did not affect the antitumor efficacy of Doxorubicin . In conclusion the ACEI Zofenoprilat exerts a protective effect on Doxorubicin induced endothelial damage , without affecting its antitumor efficacy . Thus , sulfhydryl containing ACEI may be a useful therapy for Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity . A kinase independent function for Tec kinase Q08881 in regulating antigen receptor induced serum response factor activation . The Tec family kinases are critical downstream regulators of antigen receptor signals in lymphocytes . As kinases , they act on critical substrates to regulate signals such as calcium increase leading to activation of transcription factors such as NFAT , NFkappaB and P11831 . We now show here that Q08881 , a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases , has a kinase independent function . Mutants of Q08881 that lack kinase activity or a kinase domain can rescue cells lacking Tec family kinases for antigen receptor induced P11831 activation , but not for NFAT , AP-1 or NFkappaB activation . Furthermore , expression of these mutants in WT cells enhanced P11831 activation . This kinase independent function required the SH2 domain since a mutant lacking both the kinase and SH2 domains was much less effective at rescuing P11831 activation . This kinase-deleted mutant could partially rescue P29323 activation , and interact with multiple tyrosine phosphorylated proteins during antigen receptor signaling , suggesting that Q08881 uses a scaffolding function that regulates signals leading to specific regulation of P11831 activation . p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for glucosamine-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling and plasminogen-activator inhibitor expression . BACKGROUND : Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ( HBP ) is implicated in increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) dysfunction in diabetes . DB01296 ( GlcN ) that directly activates HBP is a dietary supplement and is clinically used to treat osteoarthritis despite uncertain efficacy and adverse cardiovascular effects observed in animal models . p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38mapk ) has been shown to be involved in HBP-mediated biological processes . The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of p38mapk in GlcN-induced endothelial P05121 expression and P29474 dysfunction . METHODS AND RESULTS : In cultured human endothelial cells , GlcN time- and concentration-dependently increased P05121 protein level that was further enhanced by tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α , which was accompanied by a transient synergistic activation of p38mapk . The stimulation of P05121 by GlcN alone or by GlcN and P01375 -α in combination was inhibited by the specific inhibitor of p38mapk , but not that of JNK or P27361 /2 . Moreover , in isolated mouse aortas , GlcN caused P29474 uncoupling resulting in enhanced superoxide and decreased NO production , as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations , which were also fully prevented by the p38mapk inhibitor . CONCLUSIONS : HBP activated by GlcN increases P05121 expression and P29474 uncoupling depending on p38mapk , which not only explains hyperglycemic vascular complications , but also may bring into question the clinical use of GlcN . The present results , support currently ongoing clinical application of p38mapk inhibitor in patients with cardiovascular disease . Characterization of plant P18887 and its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen . In plants , there are no P06746 ( Pol beta ) and P49916 ( Lig3 ) genes . Thus , the plant short-patch base excision repair ( short-patch BER ) pathway must differ considerably from that in mammals . We characterized the rice ( Oryza Sativa L. cv. Nipponbare ) homologue of the mammalian X-ray repair cross complementing 1 ( P18887 ) , a well-known BER protein . The plant P18887 lacks the N-terminal domain ( NTD ) which is required for Pol beta binding and is essential for mammalian cell survival . The recombinant rice P18887 ( OsXRCC1 ) protein binds single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) as well as double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) and also interacts with rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( OsPCNA ) in a pull-down assay . Through immunoprecipitation , we demonstrated that OsXRCC1 forms a complex with P12004 in vivo . OsXRCC1 mRNA was expressed in all rice organs and was induced by application of bleomycin , but not of MMS , H(2)O(2) or UV-B . DB00290 also increased the fraction of OsXRCC1 associated with chromatin . These results suggest that OsXRCC1 contributes to DNA repair pathways that differ from the mammalian BER system . Protective effects of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade against neuropathy in experimental diabetic rats . AIMS : P08235 ( MR ) blockade is an effective treatment for hypertension and diabetic nephropathy . There are no data on the effects of MR blockade on diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) . The aim of this study was to determine whether MRs are present in the peripheral nerves and to investigate the effectiveness of MR blockade on DPN in streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) -induced diabetic rats . METHODS : Expression of MR protein and messenger RNA ( mRNA ) was examined in the peripheral nerves using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR . We next studied the effects of the selective MR antagonist eplerenone and the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan on motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) , morphometric changes and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) gene and NF-κB protein expression in the peripheral nerves of Q11206 -induced diabetic rats . RESULTS : Expression of MR protein and mRNA in peripheral nerves was equal to that in the kidney . Motor NCV was significantly improved by 8 weeks of treatment with either eplerenone ( Q04695 ± 1.2 m/s ) or candesartan ( 46.4 ± 6.8 m/s ) compared with control diabetic rats ( 33.7 ± 2.0 m/s ) ( p < 0.05 ) . Sensory NCV was also improved by treatment with candesartan or eplerenone in diabetic rats . DB00700 and candesartan caused significant improvement in mean myelin fibre area and mean myelin area compared with control diabetic rats ( p < 0.05 ) . P35354 mRNA and NF-κB protein were significantly elevated in the peripheral nerves of diabetic rats compared with control rats , and treatment with eplerenone or candesartan reduced these changes in gene expression ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : MR blockade may have neuroprotective effects on DPN . S-sulfhydration of Q02750 leads to P09874 activation and DNA damage repair . The repair of DNA damage is fundamental to normal cell development and replication . Hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) is a novel gasotransmitter that has been reported to protect cellular aging . Here , we show that H2S attenuates DNA damage in human endothelial cells and fibroblasts by S-sulfhydrating Q02750 at cysteine 341 , which leads to P09874 activation . H2S-induced Q02750 S-sulfhydration facilitates the translocation of phosphorylated P27361 /2 into nucleus , where it activates P09874 through direct interaction . Mutation of Q02750 cysteine 341 inhibits P29323 phosphorylation and P09874 activation . In the presence of H2S , activated P09874 recruits P18887 and P49916 to DNA breaks to mediate DNA damage repair , and cells are protected from senescence . DB01285 releasing factor receptor 1 ( CRF1 ) and CRF2 agonists exert an anti-inflammatory effect during the early phase of inflammation suppressing LPS-induced P01375 release from macrophages via induction of P35354 and DB00917 . P06850 ( CRF ) , the principal regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis , also modulates the inflammatory response directly , via its effect on mast cells and macrophages . On macrophages , it augments production of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced pro-inflammatory cytokines . CRF and its related peptides may also act as anti-inflammatory agents . Aim of the present work was to examine the role of macrophages on the anti-inflammatory effects of CRF-peptides and the mechanism involved . Thus , we examined if CRF receptor 1 ( CRF1 ) and CRF2 agonists exert any anti-inflammatory effect on primary mouse macrophages . We have found that : ( a ) CRF , P55089 ( P55089 )1 and Q96RP3 transiently suppressed the release of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ( P01375 ) in LPS-activated macrophages , an effect peaking at 4 h . This effect did not involve changes on P01375 transcription . ( b ) CRF peptide-induced suppression of P01375 release depended on induction of P35354 and DB00917 synthesis . ( c ) Use of specific CRF1 and CRF2 antagonists suggested that this effect involved both CRF receptor types . ( d ) The effect of CRF-peptides on P35354 was mediated via PI3K and p38MAPK . ( e ) Longer exposure of macrophages to CRF-peptides resulted in induction of P01375 production via enhancement of its transcription . In conclusion , this is the first report suggesting that CRF1 and CRF2 agonists exert a biphasic effect on macrophages . During the early stages of the inflammatory response , they suppress P01375 release via induction of P35354 / DB00917 while later on they induce P01375 transcription . Hence , the reported anti-inflammatory effect of CRF-peptides appears to involve macrophages and is confined at the early stage of inflammation . Inhibitors of Q06187 and Q08881 : state of the new drugs for cancer , autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases . Q06187 and Q08881 are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of crucial importance for B and T cell development , with loss-of-function mutations causing X-linked agammaglobulinemia and susceptibility to severe , frequently lethal , Epstein-Barr virus infection , respectively . Over the last few years , considerable efforts have been made in order to develop small-molecule inhibitors for these kinases to treat lymphocyte malignancies , autoimmunity or allergy/hypersensitivity . The rationale is that even if complete lack of Q06187 or Q08881 during development causes severe immunodeficiency , inactivation after birth may result in a less severe phenotype . Moreover , therapy can be transient or only partially block the activity of Q06187 or Q08881 . Furthermore , a drug-induced B cell deficiency is treatable by gamma globulin substitution therapy . The newly developed Q06187 inhibitor P05154 -32765 , recently renamed DB09053 , has already entered several clinical trials for various forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as for multiple myeloma . Experimental animal studies have demonstrated highly promising treatment effects also in autoimmunity . Q08881 inhibitors are still under the early developmental phase , but it can be expected that such drugs will also become very useful . In this study , we present Q06187 and Q08881 with their signalling pathways and review the development of the corresponding inhibitors . Direct injection of calcitriol or its analog improves abnormal gene expression in the hyperplastic parathyroid gland in uremia . AIMS : In this study , we investigated the effects of direct injection ( DI ) of calcitriol or maxacalcitol into the hyperplastic parathyroid gland ( PTG ) on altered gene expression related to the advanced status of secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) . METHODS : Sprague-Dawley rats were 5/6-nephrectomized ( uremic ) or sham-operated ( normal ) . In each uremic rat , one of the bilateral PTG was treated by DI of calcitriol ( PTG( Q9HD26 ) ) or maxacalcitol ( PTG( O75051 ) ) , and the other gland was treated with control solution ( PTG(CONT) ) . The PTG were evaluated for levels of expression of various mRNA and immunohistochemical staining of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) . RESULTS : Significant differences in levels of expression of mRNA and P12004 were confirmed between the uremic and normal groups . In PTG( Q9HD26 ) and PTG( O75051 ) , expressions of almost all mRNA and P12004 were significantly improved ; both agents were able to normalize the abnormalities of the uremic PTG , in contrast to the baseline and individual PTG(CONT) . However , the difference in effect between PTG( Q9HD26 ) and PTG( O75051 ) was only small . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that very high concentrations of calcitriol or maxacalcitol in the PTG improve abnormal gene expression and proliferation activity of parathyroid cells , and might explain the better control of SHPT using the DI technique . Counteraction between angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) via activating angiotensin type I and Mas receptor on rat renal mesangial cells . In the updated concept of renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) , it contains the angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) -angiotensin ( Ang ) II-angtiogensin type 1 receptor ( AT1 ) axis and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase ( Q9BYF1 ) -Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis . The former axis has been well demonstrated performing the vasoconstrictive , proliferative and pro-inflammatory functions by activation of AT1 receptors , while the later new identified axis is considered counterbalancing the effects of the former . The present study is aimed at observing the interaction between Ang-(1-7) and Ang II on cultured rat renal mesangial cells ( MCs ) . RT-PCR , Western blot and immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy results showed that both AT1 and Mas receptor were co-distributed in rat renal MCs . Ang-(1-7) showed similar effects on Ang II in cultured MCs that stimulated phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 phosphorylation and transforms growth factor-β1 synthesis , and cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis . Co-treatment of the cell with Ang-(1-7) and Ang II , Ang-(1-7) counteracted AngII-induced effects in a concentration dependent manner , but failed to alter the changes induced by endothelin-1 . The stimulating effect of Ang II was mediated by AT1 receptor while all the effects of Ang-(1-7) were blocked by Mas receptor antagonist A-779 , but not by AT1 receptor antagonist losartan or P50052 receptor antagonist PD123319 . These results suggest that Ang-(1-7) and Ang II specifically interact with each other on rat renal MCs via activation of their specific receptors , Mas and AT1 receptor respectively . Effect of P06850 on NO bioavailability , ROS production and antioxidant defense systems in endothelial EAhy926 cells . Local or ' Immune ' DB01285 -Releasing Hormone ( P06850 ) is secreted in peripheral tissues and plays a direct immunomodulatory role as an endocrine or paracrine mediator of inflammation . The present study was undertaken to determine whether P06850 affects the endothelial redox state . Accordingly , intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) content and peroxynitrite levels , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) activity and nitric oxide ( NO ) levels as well as catalase activity , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity and glutathione ( DB00143 ) levels were measured in the presence or absence of selective P06850 receptor-1 and P06850 receptor-2 inhibitors in endothelial EAhy926 cells exposed in vitro in 10(-7) M P06850 for 2 h . P06850 acting through both receptors induced a significant increase of ROS content ( p < 0.001 ) , catalase activity ( p < 0.001 ) and SOD activity ( p < 0.001 ) , accompanied by a simultaneous significant decrease of P29474 activity and NO levels ( p < 0.001 ) , as well as a significant increase in nitrotyrosine ( peroxynitrite ) levels ( p < 0.05 ) . The data indicate that P06850 may act as a regulator of pro-inflammatory mechanisms inducing adaptation of endothelial cell function to local stress . P35354 promotes early atherosclerotic lesion formation in ApoE-deficient and C57BL/6 mice . Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) 2 is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions . We have previously reported that selective inhibition of P35354 reduces early atherosclerosis in P01130 deficient mice . To examine the role of P35354 in atherosclerosis in other mouse models , we studied the effects of selective P35354 inhibition ( by rofecoxib and NS-398 ) and nonselective P36551 inhibition ( by indomethacin ) on early atherosclerotic lesion formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient ( apoE(-/-) ) mice . Selective P35354 and nonselective P36551 inhibition reduced atherosclerosis in female apoE(-/-) mice by 35-38 % and 38-51 % in the proximal and en face aortas , respectively . Next we investigated the role of macrophage P35354 by transplanting P35354 (-/-) fetal liver cells into C57BL/6 mice and challenging the mice with an atherogenic diet . Genetic deletion of P35354 from hematopoietic cells reduced atherosclerosis by 51 % . In addition , LPS activated P35354 (-/-) macrophages had decreased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) . The results demonstrate that selective inhibition of P35354 and elimination of P35354 from macrophages significantly reduces early atherosclerotic lesion formation in apoE-deficient and C57BL/6 mice . These results are compatible with P35354 expression by macrophages having a proatherogenic role , and support the potential of anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches for atherosclerosis . [ DB09053 : A new drug of B-cell malignancies ] . DB09053 ( Imbruvica® ) is a first-in-class , orally administered once-daily , that inhibits B-cell antigen receptor signaling downstream of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Q06187 ) . DB09053 has been approved in USA in February 2014 and in France in October 2014 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( Q8WXI8 ) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) and for the treatment of patients with CLL and a chromosome 17 deletion ( del 17p ) or P04637 mutation . In clinical studies , ibrutinib induced an impressive overall response rate ( 68 % ) in patients with relapsed/refractory Q8WXI8 ( phase II study ) . In CLL , ibrutinib has shown to significantly improve progression-free survival , response rate and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL , including in those with del 17p . DB09053 had an acceptable tolerability profile . Less than 10 % of patients discontinued their treatment because of adverse events . Results are pending in other B-cell lymphomas subtypes such as in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in follicular lymphoma . An approval extension has already been enregistered for Waldenström disease in USA in January 2015 . Given its efficacy and tolerability , ibrutinib is an emerging treatment option for patients with B-cell malignancies . DB03404 upregulates Egr-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells via reactive oxygen species P27361 /2-Elk-1 and NF-kappaB . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and oxidant stress are important mediators of cardiovascular pathologies including atherosclerosis . One source of ROS in the vasculature is free heme released from hemoglobin . Because Egr-1 , the regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis , is also induced by oxidant stress and is likewise implicated in atherosclerosis , we examined the regulation of Egr-1 by heme in vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) . DB03404 increased Egr-1 expression ( mRNA , protein ) within 30 minutes and P27361 /2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation within 5 minutes . Inhibiting hemin-induced P27361 /2 activation by U0126 ( MAPK-inhibitor ) , the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine , the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium chloride , the superoxide scavenger tiron , or tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II)-dimer ( carbon-monoxide donor ; CORM-2 ) blocked hemin-induced Egr-1 expression . DB03404 activated Elk-1 , P11831 , and NF-kappaB and promoted their interaction with the Egr-1 promoter . Downregulating Elk-1 ( via siRNA ) or blocking NF-kappaB activation ( via BAY-11-7082 ) abolished hemin induction of Egr-1 . Finally , hemin-induced Egr-1 bound the promoters of tissue factor ( TF ) , P00747 Activator Inhibitor ( P05121 ) -1 , and P01138 -1A Binding ( NAB ) -2 , upregulating their expression , and increased the biochemical activity of TF and P05121 . Upregulation of Egr-1 and its target genes by heme-induced oxidant stress may be an important event in the initiation and progression of inflammatory vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis . Negative feedback regulation between microRNA let-7g and the oxLDL receptor P78380 . Lectin-like oxidized P01130 -1 ( P78380 ) is a surface scavenger receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) . Several transcription factors have been reported to regulate P78380 expression . MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression , but there have been no reports of P78380 expression being regulated by microRNAs . Because the microRNA let-7g has been predicted to bind to P78380 mRNA , we investigated whether let-7g can regulate P78380 expression . Our experiments first demonstrated that oxLDL can reduce let-7g expression . We later confirmed that there is a let-7g binding site on the 3'-untranslated region of P78380 mRNA . We showed that intracellular Ca(2+)-activated protein kinase C is involved in the oxLDL- P78380 -let-7g pathway . Bioinformatics predicted that the let-7g promoter has a binding site for the transcriptional repressor O75051 -1 . We used a promoter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation to confirm this binding . Consequently , knockdown of O75051 -1 was found to increase let-7g expression . Transfection of let-7g inhibited oxLDL-induced P78380 and O75051 -1 expression , cell proliferation and migration . Mice fed with a high-fat diet showed a decrease in let-7g and an increase in P78380 and O75051 -1 . A study on humans showed the serum levels of let-7g are lower in subjects with hypercholesterolemia compared with normal controls . Our findings identify a negative feedback regulation between let-7g and P78380 , and indicate that let-7g could be a target to treat cardiovascular disease . Mechanism of purinergic activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells . BACKGROUND : Decreased endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase ( P29474 ) activity and NO production are critical contributors to the endothelial dysfunction and vascular complications observed in many diseases , including diabetes mellitus . Extracellular nucleotides activate P29474 and increase NO generation ; however , the mechanism of this observation is not fully clarified . METHODS AND RESULTS : To elucidate the signaling pathway(s) leading to nucleotide-mediated P29474 phosphorylation at DB00133 -1177 , human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with several nucleotides , including DB00171 , UTP , and ADP , in the presence or absence of selective inhibitors . These experiments identified P47900 , P41231 , and possibly P51582 as the purinergic receptors involved in P29474 phosphorylation and demonstrated that this process was adenosine independent . Nucleotide-induced P29474 phosphorylation and activity were inhibited by BAPTA-AM ( an intracellular free calcium chelator ) , rottlerin ( a protein kinase Cdelta inhibitor ) , and protein kinase Cdelta siRNA . In contrast , blockade of AMP-activated protein kinase , calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II , calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase , serine/threonine protein kinase B , protein kinase A , extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 , and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase did not affect nucleotide-mediated P29474 phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS : The present study indicates that extracellular nucleotide-mediated P29474 phosphorylation is calcium and protein kinase Cdelta dependent . This newly identified signaling pathway opens new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction . DB00173 nucleotides inhibit cytokine generation by human mast cells through a Gs-coupled receptor . DB00171 and ADP activate functionally distinct G protein-coupled purinergic ( P2Y ) receptors . We determined the expression and function of adenine nucleotide-specific P2Y receptors on cord blood-derived human mast cells ( hMCs ) . Human MCs expressed mRNA encoding the ADP-specific P47900 , Q9H244 , and Q9BPV8 receptors ; the DB00171 /UTP-specific P41231 receptor ; and the DB00171 -selective Q96G91 receptor . ADP ( 0.05-50 muM ) induced calcium flux that was completely blocked by a P47900 receptor-selective antagonist and was not cross-desensitized by DB00171 . Low doses of ADP induced strong phosphorylation of P29323 and p38 MAPKs ; higher doses stimulated eicosanoid production and exocytosis . Although MAPK phosphorylation was blocked by a combination of P47900 - and Q9H244 -selective antagonists , neither interfered with secretion responses . Unexpectedly , both ADP and DB00171 inhibited the generation of P01375 in response to the O60603 ligand , peptidoglycan , and blocked the production of P01375 , P10145 , and MIP-1beta in response to leukotriene D(4) . These effects were mimicked by two DB00171 analogues , adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and 2',3'-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate ( BzATP ) , but not by adenosine . ADP , DB00171 , adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) , and 2',3'-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate each induced DB02527 accumulation , stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB , and up-regulated the expression of inducible DB02527 early repressor , a CREB-dependent inhibitor of cytokine transcription . Human MCs thus express several ADP-selective P2Y receptors and at least one G(s)-coupled ADP/ DB00171 receptor . Nucleotides could therefore contribute to MC-dependent microvascular leakage in atherosclerosis , tissue injury , and innate immunity while simultaneously limiting the extent of subsequent inflammation by attenuating the generation of inducible cytokines by MCs . Contribution of captopril thiol group to the prevention of spontaneous hypertension . We aimed to compare the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors captopril ( containing thiol group ) and enalapril ( without thiol group ) on the development of spontaneous hypertension and to analyze mechanisms of their actions , particularly effects on oxidative stress and NO production . Six-week-old SHR were divided into three groups : control , group receiving captopril ( 50 mg/kg/day ) or enalapril ( 50 mg/kg/day ) for 6 weeks . At the end of experiment , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased by 41 % in controls . Both captopril and enalapril prevented blood pressure increase , however , SBP in the captopril group ( 121+/-5 mmHg ) was significantly lower than that in the enalapril group ( 140+/-5 mmHg ) . Concentration of conjugated dienes in the aorta was significantly lower in the captopril group compared to the enalapril group . DB01197 and enalapril increased NO synthase activity in the heart and aorta to the similar level . Neither captopril nor enalapril was , however , able to increase the expression of P29474 . Both P12821 inhibitors increased the level of cGMP . However , cGMP level was significantly higher in the aorta of captopril group . We conclude that captopril , beside inhibition of P12821 , prevented hypertension by increasing NO synthase activity and by simultaneous decrease of oxidative stress which resulted in increase of cGMP concentration . [ The effect of blood pressure-reducing therapy with captopril on tubular marker excretion in type-1 diabetics with nephropathy ] . A prospective open clinical trial was carried out with 23 hypertensive type I diabetics ( 13 men , ten women , mean age 49 +/- 9.1 years , duration of diabetes 18 +/- 9.1 years ) with early nephropathy . Glomerular and tubular renal function and metabolic parameters were monitored during 8 months ' treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor , captopril , in addition to previous antihypertensive treatment with one or more drugs . Blood pressure control tended to improve on captopril ( systolic pressures 152 +/- 13 vs 140 +/- 13 mm Hg , P < 0.05 ; diastolic pressures 89 +/- 10 vs 87 +/- 10 mm Hg , not significant ) . Proteinuria ( > 0.5 g/24 hours ) fell into the microalbuminuria range ( albumin excretion 2-20 mg/mmol creatinine ) in four out of 13 patients , and microalbuminuria disappeared in four out of ten patients . Urinary levels of the brush border enzyme O60502 ( NAG ) , a marker of tubular dysfunction , were initially raised and fell significantly after 8 months ' treatment with captopril ( 20.3 +/- 14.4 vs 8.8 +/- 8.1 U/g creatinine ; P < 0.01 ) . DB01197 did not affect metabolic control ( HbA1 , total , HDL and LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , apolipoproteins A1 and B ) or the insulin dosage . These results show that long-term treatment with captopril may favourably influence both albumin excretion and NAG activity , a marker of tubular dysfunction , in type I diabetics with nephropathy . Is transforming growth factor-β signaling activated in human hypertrophied prostate treated by 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ? BACKGROUND AND AIM : It is well known that androgen deprivation relates to penile fibrosis , so we hypothesize that long-term treatment with 5-alphareductase inhibitors ( 5ARIs ) may increase the risk of fibrosis of prostate . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Thirty-two BPH patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate were enrolled . The patients were divided into two groups : group one , 16 patients underwent TURP who had been treated with tamsulosin for 2 years ; group two , 16 patients underwent TURP who had been treated with combination of tamsulosin and dutasteride for at least 1 year . We evaluated the expressions of P29475 , P35228 , P29474 , TGF-β1 , TGF-β2 , phosphorylated- Q15796 /3 ( p- Q15796 /3 ) , P12830 , P19022 , and α-smooth muscle actin in the resected prostate tissues by western blotting , and the TGF-β concentration was determined by ELISA kit . RESULTS : The expressions of 3 isoforms of NOS were significantly increased in group 2 except of P29474 in lateral prostate , and the expressions of TGF-β1 , TGF-β2 , and p- Q15796 /3 increased about 2-fold compared with group 1 . In group 2 , the P12830 expression decreased while P19022 expression increased significantly . CONCLUSIONS : The overexpression of P29475 may contribute to prostate smooth muscle relaxation ; however , long-time treatment with 5 Q9Y4X5 increases the risk of fibrosis of prostate . Common variants of P29474 and P18887 genes may predict acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery . PURPOSE : To evaluate the impact of functional polymorphisms in genes related to DNA repair mechanisms ( P18887 , P04637 , P43246 , P20585 , P18074 ) , oxidative stress response ( P09211 , P08263 , P29474 , P04179 ) and fibroblast proliferation ( TGFβ1 ) on the risk of acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Skin toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria in 286 breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery . Genotyping was conducted by PCR-RFLP analysis and real-time PCR allelic discrimination assay on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood . RESULTS : In the multivariate analysis , nominally significant associations , before multiple testing corrections , were found between P18887 T-77C ( T carriers vs. CC , OR : 2.240 , 95 % CI : 1.015-4.941 , P=0.046 ) , P29474 G894T polymorphisms ( TT vs. G carriers , OR : 2.473 , 95 % CI : 1.220-5.012 , P=0.012 ) , breast diameter ( OR : 1.138 , 95 % CI : 1.001-1.293 , P=0.048 ) , boost dose-fractionation ( 3 Gy vs. no boost , OR : 4.902 , 95 % CI : 1.458-16.483 , P=0.010 ) and ≥ grade 2 acute radiation skin toxicity in breast cancer patients . CONCLUSIONS : As our exploratory study suggests that P18887 T-77C and P29474 G874T may confer an increased risk of acute skin reactions to radiotherapy in breast cancer patients , further confirmatory studies are warranted to determine the clinical significance . Thrombin inhibits migration of human hepatic myofibroblasts . Several lines of data recently pointed out a role of the serine proteinase thrombin in liver fibrogenesis , but its mechanism of action is unknown . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of thrombin on the migration of human liver myofibroblasts . We show here that thrombin inhibits both basal migration and platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) -BB-induced migration of myofibroblasts . By using a thrombin antagonist , a protease-activated receptor ( PAR ) -1 mimetic peptide , and a P25116 antibody , we show that this effect is dependent on the catalytic activity of thrombin and on P25116 activation . Thrombin 's effect on basal migration was dependent on cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) activation because it was blocked by the P35354 inhibitors NS-398 and nimesulide , and pharmacological studies showed that it was relayed through prostaglandin E(2) and its EP(2) receptor . On the other hand , thrombin-induced inhibition of DB00102 -induced migration was not dependent on P35354 . We show that thrombin inhibits PDGF-induced Akt-1 phosphorylation . This effect was consecutive to inhibition of PDGF-beta receptor activation through active dephosphorylation . Thus thrombin , through two distinct mechanisms , inhibits both basal- and DB00102 -induced migration of human hepatic liver myofibroblasts . The fine tuning of myofibroblast migration may be one of the mechanisms used by thrombin to regulate liver fibrogenesis . Swept-source optical coherence tomography of lower limb wound healing with histopathological correlation . Direct noninvasive visualization of wound bed with depth information is important to understand the tissue repair . We correlate skin swept-source-optical coherence tomography ( O75051 ) with histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation on traumatic lower limb wounds under honey dressing to compare and assess the tissue repair features acquired noninvasively and invasively . Analysis of optical biopsy identifies an uppermost brighter band for stratum corneum with region specific thickness ( p < 0.0001 ) and gray-level intensity ( p < 0.0001 ) variation . Below the stratum corneum , variation in optical intensities is remarkable in different regions of the wound bed . Correlation between O75051 and microscopic observations are explored especially in respect to progressive growth and maturation of the epithelial and subepithelial components . Characteristic transition of uniform hypolucid band in O75051 image for depigmented zone to wavy highly lucid band in the pigmented zone could be directly correlated with the microscopic findings . The transformation of prematured epithelium of depigmented area , with low expression of P12830 , to matured epithelium with higher P12830 expression in pigmented zone , implicated plausible change in their optical properties as depicted in O75051 . This correlated evaluation of multimodal images demonstrates applicability of swept-source- O75051 in wound research and importance of integrated approach in validation of new technology . High loading dose of clopidogrel is unable to satisfactorily inhibit platelet reactivity in patients with glycoprotein IIIA gene polymorphism : a genetic substudy of PRAGUE-8 trial . The study aimed to assess the impact of nine polymorphisms of genes encoding platelet receptors , enzymes , and hemostatic factors on clopidogrel efficacy to inhibit platelet reactivity in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective coronary angiography either with or without ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention . The study was performed as a genetic substudy of the PRAGUE-8 trial . Ninety-five patients pretreated with 600 mg clopidogrel at least 6 h prior to coronary angiography were tested . Baseline platelet reactivity to ADP was assessed before the drug was administered . DB00758 efficacy was tested again at 12 and 28 h after administration . Polymorphisms of platelet receptors , glycoprotein ( GP ) Ia ( 807C/T ) , Q9HCN6 ( 13254C/T ) , P05106 ( PlA1/PlA2 ) , P25116 ( IVSn-14A/T ) , Q9H244 ( 32C/T ) , Q9H244 ( H1/H2 ) haplotype , gene variations of cyclooxygenase-1 , Leiden , and factor II mutations were studied . Flow cytometric tests of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation states were used as a measure of drug efficacy . None of the gene polymorphisms influenced baseline ADP-induced platelet reactivity significantly . Twenty-eight hours after drug administration , differences in suppression of ADP-induced platelet reactivity were observed between polymorphism-positive and polymorphism-negative patients . Inhibition of platelet reactivity , after 600 mg of clopidogrel , was significantly less in carriers of PlA2 ( P=0.009 ) for mean decrease in platelet reactivity index . The proportion of clopidogrel nonresponders ( platelet reactivity index > 50 % ) was apparently higher in PlA2 carriers in comparison with PlA1/PlA1 patients ( 54 vs. 24 % , P=0.082 ) . A 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel failed to acceptably inhibit platelet reactivity in patients who were positive for the PlA2 polymorphism . Purinergic P47900 receptor signaling mediates wound stimuli-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts . Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts ( ISMFs ) are crucial for barrier formation against inflammatory stimuli . Physical injury induces cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression , which accelerates wound healing by ISMFs . However , the mechanism of P35354 induction remains unclear . Physically damaged cells release DB00171 . Here , we investigate the role of DB00171 -purinergic signaling in wound-induced P35354 induction in ISMFs . By 24h post-injury , bovine ISMFs had migrated to and closed the wounded area . A P36551 inhibitor , indomethacin or a purinergic P2 receptor antagonist , suramin , inhibited wound healing . However , additional treatment with indomethacin did not influence wound healing in suramin-treated ISMFs . RT-PCR showed an increase in P35354 mRNA expression 2h post-injury , which was inhibited by suramin . These results suggest that DB00171 mediates wound-induced P35354 elevation . We next assessed the contribution of various purinergic receptors in P35354 induction . An DB00171 analog , ATPγS and a purinergic P47900 , 11-13 receptors agonist , ADP , were among the agents tested which increased P35354 expression . ATPγS-induced P35354 mRNA expression was suppressed by suramin or a purinergic P2Xs , P47900 , 4 , 6 , and 13 receptors antagonist , PPADS . These data suggest the involvement of Gq-coupled purinergic P47900 receptor or Gi-coupled purinergic Q9BPV8 receptor in P35354 induction . U73122 , an inhibitor of phospholipase C , which is a downstream signal of Gq protein , showed suppression of P35354 mRNA expression . However , pertussis toxin , a Gi inhibitor , did not show suppression . We also revealed that inhibitors of p38 MAPK and PKC inhibited ATPγS-induced P35354 mRNA expression . Collectively , purinergic P47900 receptor signaling mediates wound-induced P35354 expression through p38 MAPK and PKC pathways in ISMFs . Thrombin has biphasic effects on the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in endothelial cells and contributes to experimental pulmonary hypertension . BACKGROUND : A potential role for coagulation factors in pulmonary arterial hypertension has been recently described , but the mechanism of action is currently not known . Here , we investigated the interactions between thrombin and the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in pulmonary endothelial cells and experimental pulmonary hypertension . PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Chronic treatment with the selective thrombin inhibitor melagatran ( 0.9 mg/kg daily via implanted minipumps ) reduced right ventricular hypertrophy in the rat monocrotaline model of experimental pulmonary hypertension . In vitro , thrombin was found to have biphasic effects on key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Acute thrombin stimulation led to increased expression of the cGMP-elevating factors endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) and soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC ) subunits , leading to increased cGMP levels . By contrast , prolonged exposition of pulmonary endothelial cells to thrombin revealed a characteristic pattern of differential expression of the key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway , in which specifically the factors contributing to cGMP elevation ( P29474 and sGC ) were reduced and the cGMP-hydrolyzing O76074 was elevated ( qPCR and Western blot ) . In line with the differential expression of key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway , a reduction of cGMP by prolonged thrombin stimulation was found . The effects of prolonged thrombin exposure were confirmed in endothelial cells of pulmonary origin ( HPAECs and HPMECs ) . Similar effects could be induced by activation of protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest a link between thrombin generation and cGMP depletion in lung endothelial cells through negative regulation of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway , possibly mediated via P25116 , which could be of relevance in pulmonary arterial hypertension . DB04630 stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 activation . The nongenomic effects of aldosterone have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases . DB04630 -induced nongenomic effects are attributable in part to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) , a classical mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase . Q13164 ( Q13164 ) , a newly identified Q96HU1 kinase , has been shown to be involved in cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival . We examined whether aldosterone stimulates Q13164 -mediated proliferation of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells ( RASMCs ) . P08235 ( MR ) expression and localization were evaluated by Western blotting analysis and fluorolabeling methods . P27361 /2 and Q13164 activities were measured by Western blotting analysis with the respective phosphospecific antibodies . Cell proliferation was determined by Alamar Blue colorimetric assay . DB04630 ( 0.1 to 100 nmol/L ) dose-dependently activated Q13164 in RASMCs , with a peak at 30 minutes . To clarify whether aldosterone-induced Q13164 activation is an MR-mediated phenomenon , we examined the effect of eplerenone , a selective MR antagonist , on aldosterone-induced Q13164 activation . DB00700 ( 0.1 to 10 micromol/L ) dose-dependently inhibited aldosterone-induced Q13164 activation in RASMCs . DB04630 also stimulated RASMC proliferation , which was inhibited by eplerenone . DB04630 -mediated phenomena were concluded to be attributable to a nongenomic effect because cycloheximide failed to inhibit aldosterone-induced Q13164 activation . Transfection of dominant-negative Q96HU1 kinase/ P29323 kinase 5 ( Q13163 ) , which is an upstream regulator of Q13164 , partially inhibited aldosterone-induced RASMC proliferation , which was almost completely inhibited by MEK inhibitor PD98059 . In addition to the classical steroid activity , rapid nongenomic effects induced by aldosterone may represent an alternative etiology for vascular diseases such as hypertension . DB01296 sulfate inhibits P01375 and P01579 -induced production of P05362 in human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro . PURPOSE : DB01296 sulfate ( GS ) is a naturally occurring sugar that possesses some immunosuppressive effects in vitro and in vivo , but its mechanism is unknown . We investigated whether GS could modulate the proinflammatory cytokine-induced expression of the gene for intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 , an inflammatory protein in human retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells . METHODS : ARPE-19 cells were used as a model to determine the effects of GS on the expression of the P05362 gene upregulated by P01375 or P01579 , by Western blot analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . The activation and nuclear translocation of the nuclear factors NF-kappaB and P42224 were evaluated by immunocytochemistry , Western blot analysis , and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) . RESULTS : Both P01375 and P01579 increased the expression of P05362 at the mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner in ARPE-19 cells . GS effectively downregulated the P01375 - or P01579 -induced expression of P05362 in the protein and mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner . GS further inhibited the nuclear translocation of p65 proteins in P01375 and phosphorylated P42224 in P01579 -stimulated ARPE-19 cells . CONCLUSIONS : GS inhibits the expression of the P05362 gene in ARPE-19 cell stimulated with P01375 or P01579 through blockade of NF-kappaB subunit p65 and nuclear translocation of P42224 . This study has demonstrated a potentially important property of GS in reducing P05362 mediated inflammatory mechanisms in the eye .
Targeting MET and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer . Effective management of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) remains an important unmet medical need . MET and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) are rational targets for intervention in CRPC . Clinical trials involving agents that inhibit one but not both pathways have reported modest activity and no improvement in overall survival . DB08875 is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits both MET and P35968 . A phase II randomized discontinuation study involving subjects with CRPC demonstrated that cabozantinib therapy is associated with improvement in bone scans , bone turnover markers , and pain response , but with significant adverse events leading to dose reduction and treatment discontinuation . Lower doses of cabozantinib retain high levels of activity with less toxicity . Ongoing phase III clinical trials will define the role of cabozantinib in CRPC . We summarize the rationale for targeting MET and VEGFR pathways in CRPC and the clinical data available to date . DB08875 for the treatment of advanced medullary thyroid cancer . INTRODUCTION : Patients with advanced medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) have poor prognoses and limited treatment options . Improved knowledge about molecular aberrations associated with P04629 and the availability of novel targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have led to new potential treatment modalities . DB08875 is an oral multitargeted TKI with activity against multiple receptors including P07949 , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 ( P35968 ) , and MET that has been evaluated in P04629 in the preclinical and clinical arenas . METHODS : This article reviews unmet clinical needs in advanced P04629 . The authors consider novel agents that have been studied in P04629 , with a focus on the investigational agent cabozantinib . Up-to-date clinical data of cabozantinib in P04629 are discussed . RESULTS : Recent clinical evaluation suggests that cabozantinib is the first agent to prolong progression-free survival in patients with progressive P04629 . These findings indicate that cabozantinib may be an effective therapy in advanced P04629 . No improvement in overall survival has been demonstrated but data are not mature . CONCLUSION : DB08875 may be an effective treatment option for patients with advanced P04629 and is worthy of further evaluation . P00797 inhibition reduces atherosclerotic plaque neovessel formation and regresses advanced atherosclerotic plaques . OBJECTIVE : The interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) in the pathogenesis of advanced atherosclerotic plaques is not well understood . We studied the effects of the renin inhibitor aliskiren on the progression of advanced atherosclerotic plaque in apolipoprotein E-deficient ( ApoE(-/-) ) mice with a special focus on plaque neovessel formation . METHODS AND RESULTS : Four-wk-old ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet for 8 wks , and the mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups and administered a vehicle , hydralazine , or aliskiren for an additional 12 wks . DB09026 reduced the atherosclerotic plaque area and plaque neovessel density . It increased the plaque collagen and elastin contents , and reduced plasma angiotensin II levels and plaque macrophage infiltration and cathepsin S ( CatS ) protein . DB09026 also decreased the levels of AT1R , gp91phox , O60603 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and CatS mRNAs in the aortic roots . DB01275 had no beneficial vascular effects , although its administration resulted in the same degree of blood pressure reduction as aliskiren . CatS deficiency mimicked the aliskiren-mediated vasculoprotective effect in the ApoE(-/-) mice , but aliskiren showed no further benefits in ApoE(-/-) CatS(-/-) mice . In vitro , O60603 silencing reduced CatS expression induced by angiotensin II . Moreover , aliskiren or the inhibition of CatS impaired the endothelial cell angiogenic action in vitro or/and ex vivo . CONCLUSION : P00797 inhibition appears to inhibit advanced plaque neovessel formation in ApoE(-/-) mice and to decrease the vascular inflammatory action and extracellular matrix degradation , partly by reducing AT1R/ O60603 -mediated CatS activation and activity , thus regressing advanced atherosclerosis . An absolute role of the PKC-dependent NF-kappaB activation for induction of P14780 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) play an important role in inflammation , tumor cell invasion , and metastasis . We found that phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) -stimulated invasion of the hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) SNU-387 and SNU-398 cells and that PMA induced the secretion of P14780 in the cells , but did not induce the secretion of P08253 . The PMA-induced P14780 secretion was abolished by treatment of a pan-protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor , GF109203X , and an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation , sulfasalazine , and partly inhibited by treatment of inhibitors of P29323 pathway , PD98059 and U0126 . In addition , the PMA-stimulated activation of the P14780 promoter was completely inhibited by a mutation of the NF-kappaB site within the P14780 promoter , but not completely by mutations of two AP-1 sites . Moreover , the P14780 induction by P14210 and P01375 was also completely inhibited by GF109203X and sulfasalazine , but not by PD98059 and U0126 . These data demonstrate that the PKC-dependent NF-kappaB activation is absolute for P14780 induction and that the PKC-dependent P29323 activation devotes to increase the expression level of P14780 , in HCC cells . Exome-level comparison of primary well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and their cell lines . Neuroendocrine cancer cell lines are used to investigate therapeutic targets in neuroendocrine tumors ( NET ) and have been instrumental in the design of clinical trials targeting the PI3K/AKT/ P42345 pathways , P15692 inhibitors , and somatostatin analogues . It remains unknown , however , whether the genomic makeup of NET cell lines reflect that of primary NET since comprehensive unbiased genome sequencing has not been performed on the cell lines . Four bronchopulmonary NET ( BP-NET ) -NCI-H720 , NCI-H727 , NCI-H835 , and UMC11-and two pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( panNET ) -BON-1 and QGP1-were cultured . DNA was isolated , and exome sequencing was done . GATK and EXCAVATOR were used for bioinformatic analysis . We detected a total of 1,764 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants at a rate of 8 per Mb in BP-NET and 4.3 per Mb in panNET cell lines , including 52 mutated COSMIC cancer genes in these cell lines , such as P04637 , P38398 , P06400 , P49815 , P46531 , Q09472 , GNAS , P35968 , Q15831 , and P25054 but not P46100 , Q9UER7 , nor O00255 . Our data suggest that mutation rate , the pattern of copy number variations , and the mutational spectra in the BP-NET cell lines are more similar to the changes observed in small cell lung cancer than those found in primary BP-NET . Likewise , mutation rate and pattern including the absence of mutations in P46100 / Q9UER7 , O00255 , and P25490 in the panNET cell lines BON1 and QGP1 suggest that these cell lines do not have the genetic signatures of a primary panNET . These results suggest that results from experiments with BP-NET and panNET cell lines need to be interpreted with caution . P00533 variant III mutations in lung tumorigenesis and sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . The tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib ( DB00317 ) and erlotinib ( Tarceva ) have shown anti-tumor activity in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Dramatic and durable responses have occurred in NSCLC tumors with mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) . In contrast , these inhibitors have shown limited efficacy in glioblastoma , where a distinct P00533 mutation , the variant III ( vIII ) in-frame deletion of exons 2-7 , is commonly found . In this study , we determined that EGFRvIII mutation was present in 5 % ( 3/56 ) of analyzed human lung squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) but was not present in human lung adenocarcinoma ( 0/123 ) . We analyzed the role of the EGFRvIII mutation in lung tumorigenesis and its response to tyrosine kinase inhibition . Tissue-specific expression of EGFRvIII in the murine lung led to the development of NSCLC . Most importantly , these lung tumors depend on EGFRvIII expression for maintenance . Treatment with an irreversible P00533 inhibitor , HKI-272 , dramatically reduced the size of these EGFRvIII-driven murine tumors in 1 week . Similarly , Ba/ P13726 cells transformed with the EGFRvIII mutant were relatively resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib in vitro but proved sensitive to HKI-272 . These findings suggest a therapeutic strategy for cancers harboring the EGFRvIII mutation . Induction of high mobility group box 1 release from serotonin-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells . High mobility group box 1 ( P09429 ) is a non-histone nuclear protein which is released from the nucleus of activated macrophages into the extracellular space in response to stimuli such as endotoxin or necrosis . The P09429 functions as a potent proinflammatory cytokine in the extracellular spaces . Recently , P09429 has been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis . However , the association between P09429 and the development of atherosclerosis is poorly understood . Therefore , we examined whether serotonin ( 5-HT ) , a key factor involved in the development of atherosclerosis , induced P09429 release in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . We found that 5-HT induced the release of P09429 but not of P27361 /2 and JNK from HUVECs via the 5-HT receptor ( P28222 ) /p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway . The p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the P28222 antagonist GR55526 markedly inhibited P09429 release from 5-HT-stimulated HUVECs . The vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) derived from activated macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions also plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis . We found that P09429 induced P15692 production in macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells . P09429 induced the activation of p38MAPK , P27361 /2 and Akt . The P19957 -kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly inhibited P15692 production in P09429 -stimulated macrophages , while other kinase inhibitors did not . These results suggest that P09429 release may contribute as a risk factor in the development and progression of atherosclerosis . P10275 rediscovered : the new biology and targeting the androgen receptor therapeutically . Discoveries over the past decade suggest that castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) is sensitive , but not resistant to , further manipulation of the androgen-androgen receptor ( AR ) axis . Several new therapies that target this axis have demonstrated clinical activity . In this article , preclinical and clinical findings occurring in the field of AR-targeted therapies are reviewed . Reviews of scientific and clinical development are divided into those occurring prereceptor ( androgen production and conversion ) and at the level of the receptor ( AR aberrations and therapies targeting AR directly ) . Intracrine androgen production and AR amplification , among others , are among the principal aberrancies driving CRPC growth . Phase III data with abiraterone acetate and phase II data with DB08899 , along with other similar therapies , confirm for the clinician that the scientific findings related to persistent AR signaling in a castrate milieu can be harnessed to produce significant clinical benefit for patients with the disease . Studies aimed at optimizing the timing of their use and exploring the mechanisms of resistance to these therapies are under way . The clinical success of therapies that directly target androgen synthesis as well as the most common aberrancies of the AR confirm that prostate cancer retains dependence on AR signaling , even in the castrate state . Dynamic genetic linkage of intermediate blood pressure phenotypes during postural adaptations in a founder population . Blood pressure ( BP ) is a dynamic phenotype that varies rapidly to adjust to changing environmental conditions . Standing upright is a recent evolutionary trait , and genetic factors that influence postural adaptations may contribute to BP variability . We studied the effect of posture on the genetics of BP and intermediate BP phenotypes . We included 384 sib-pairs in 64 sib-ships from families ascertained by early-onset hypertension and dyslipidemia . Blood pressure , three hemodynamic and seven neuroendocrine intermediate BP phenotypes were measured with subjects lying supine and standing upright . The effect of posture on estimates of heritability and genetic covariance was investigated in full pedigrees . Linkage was conducted on 196 candidate genes by sib-pair analyses , and empirical estimates of significance were obtained . A permutation algorithm was implemented to study the postural effect on linkage . ADRA1A , APO , CAST , Q9Y5Q5 , P34998 , P24530 , P09038 , GC , P17302 , Q92953 , P08254 , P01303 , P08235 , P26678 , P37173 , P25445 , and P34981 showed evidence of linkage with any phenotype in the supine position and not upon standing , whereas P15121 , P16671 , P25101 , P12259 , P14780 , PKD2 , P27169 , P37231 , Q9UBK2 , P17252 , and P07949 were specifically linked to standing phenotypes . Genetic profiling was undertaken to show genetic interactions among intermediate BP phenotypes and genes specific to each posture . When investigators perform genetic studies exclusively on a single posture , important genetic components of BP are missed . Supine and standing BPs have distinct genetic signatures . Standardized maneuvers influence the results of genetic investigations into BP , thus reflecting its dynamic regulation . DB08875 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma by a dual blockade of P35968 and MET . PURPOSE : MET signaling has been suggested a potential role in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) and associated with prometastasis during antiangiogenesis therapy . We investigated the potential association between MET expression and therapeutic response to sorafenib in patients with HCC . Antitumor effects of cabozantinib , a dual inhibitor of MET and P35968 , were examined in cultured HCC cells as well as in vivo models . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Total MET and phosphorylated MET ( p-MET ) were measured in 29 resected HCC specimens , and correlated with response to sorafenib as postoperative adjuvant therapy . In the second set of experiments using cultured HCC cells , and mouse xenograft and metastatic models , effects of cabozantinib were examined . RESULTS : High level of p-MET in resected HCC specimens was associated with resistance to adjuvant sorafenib therapy . In cultured HCC cells that expressed p-MET , cabozantinib inhibited the activity of MET and its downstream effectors , leading to P55008 -phase arrest . DB08875 inhibited tumor growth in p-MET-positive and p-MET-negative HCC by decreasing angiogenesis , inhibiting proliferation , and promoting apoptosis , but it exhibited more profound efficacy in p-MET-positive HCC xenografts . DB08875 blocked the hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) -stimulated MET pathway and inhibited the migration and invasion of the HCC cells . Notably , cabozantinib reduced the number of metastatic lesions in the lung and liver in the experimental metastatic mouse model . CONCLUSIONS : Patients with HCC with high level of p-MET are associated with resistance to adjuvant sorafenib treatment . The dual blockade of P35968 and MET by cabozantinib has significant antitumor activities in HCC , and the activation of MET in HCC may be a promising efficacy-predicting biomarker .

The discovery of P07949 fusions in lung cancers has uncovered a new therapeutic target for patients whose tumors harbor these changes . In an unselected population of non-small cell lung carcinomas ( NSCLCs ) , P07949 fusions are present in 1 % to 2 % of cases . This incidence increases substantially , however , in never-smokers with lung adenocarcinomas that lack other known driver oncogenes . Although preclinical data provide experimental support for the use of P07949 inhibitors in the treatment of P07949 fusion-positive tumors , clinical data on response are lacking . We report preliminary data for the first three patients treated with the P07949 inhibitor cabozantinib on a prospective phase II trial for patients with P07949 fusion-positive NSCLCs ( NCT01639508 ) . Confirmed partial responses were observed in 2 patients , including one harboring a novel Q9UPN9 - P07949 fusion . A third patient with a P33176 - P07949 fusion has had prolonged stable disease approaching 8 months ( 31 weeks ) . All three patients remain progression-free on treatment . Germline P07949 634 mutation positive MEN 2A-related C-cell hyperplasias have genetic features consistent with intraepithelial neoplasia . C-cell hyperplasias are normally multifocal in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A . We compared clonality , microsatellite pattern of tumor suppressor genes , and cellular kinetics of C-cell hyperplasia foci in each thyroid lobe . We selected 11 females from multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A kindred treated with thyroidectomy due to hypercalcitoninemia . C-cell hyperplasia foci were microdissected for DNA extraction to analyze the methylation pattern of androgen receptor alleles and microsatellite regions ( P04637 , P06400 , P19544 , and P21359 ) . Consecutive sections were selected for MIB-1 , pRB1 , p53 , Mdm-2 , and p21WAF1 immunostaining , DNA content analysis , and in situ end labeling . Appropriate tissue controls were run . Only two patients had medullary thyroid carcinoma foci . Nine informative C-cell hyperplasia patients showed germline point mutation in P07949 , eight of them with the same androgen receptor allele preferentially methylated in both lobes . C-cell hyperplasia foci showed heterogeneous DNA deletions revealed by loss of heterozygosity of P04637 ( 12 of 20 ) , P06400 ( 6 of 14 ) , and P19544 ( 4 of 20 ) and hypodiploid G0/ P55008 cells ( 14 of 20 ) , low cellular turnover ( MIB-1 index 4.5 % , in situ end labeling index 0.03 % ) , and significantly high nuclear area to DNA index ratio . MEN 2A ( germline point mutation in P07949 codon 634 ) C-cell hyperplasias are monoclonal and genetically heterogeneous and show down-regulated apoptosis , findings consistent with an intraepithelial neoplasia . Concordant X-chromosome inactivation and interstitial gene deletions suggest clone expansions of precursors occurring at a point in embryonic development before divergence of each thyroid lobe and may represent a paradigm for other germline mutations . DB05039 inhibits tumor cell invasiveness and P14780 expression by suppressing IKK/NF-κB activation . The β2 adrenergic receptor ( P07550 ) is a G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor expressed in the human respiratory tract and widely recognized as a pharmacological target for treatments of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( P48444 ) . Although a number of P07550 agonists have been developed for use in asthma therapy , indacaterol is the only ultra-long-acting inhaled β2-agonist ( LABA ) approved by the FDA for relieving the symptoms in P48444 patients . The precise molecular mechanism underlying the pharmacological effect of indacaterol , however , remains unclear . Here , we show that β-arrestin-2 mediates the internalization of P07550 following indacaterol treatment . Moreover , we demonstrate that indacaterol significantly inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) -induced NF-κB activity by reducing levels of both phosphorylated-IKK and -IκBα , thereby decreasing NF-κB nuclear translocation and the expression of P14780 , an NF-κB target gene . Subsequently , we show that indacaterol significantly inhibits P01375 -α/NF-κB-induced cell invasiveness and migration in a human cancer cell line . In conclusion , we propose that indacaterol may inhibit NF-κB activity in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner , preventing further lung damage and improving lung function in P48444 patients . P10275 YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration . X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration . SBMA is caused by polyglutamine repeat expansions in the androgen receptor ( AR ) . To determine the basis of AR polyglutamine neurotoxicity , we introduced human AR yeast artificial chromosomes carrying either 20 or 100 CAGs into mouse embryonic stem cells . The AR100 transgenic mice developed a late-onset , gradually progressive neuromuscular phenotype accompanied by motor neuron degeneration , indicating striking recapitulation of the human disease . We then tested the hypothesis that polyglutamine-expanded AR interferes with CREB binding protein ( CBP ) -mediated transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and observed altered CBP-AR binding and P15692 reduction in AR100 mice . We found that mutant AR-induced death of motor neuron-like cells could be rescued by P15692 . Our results suggest that SBMA motor neuronopathy involves altered expression of P15692 , consistent with a role for P15692 as a neurotrophic/survival factor in motor neuron disease . P00797 angiotensin system modulates P42345 pathway through AT2R in HIVAN . P42345 ( P42345 ) has been reported to contribute to the development of HIV-associated nephropathy ( HIVAN ) . We hypothesized that HIV may be activating renal tissue P42345 pathway through renin angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) via Angiotensin Receptor Type II receptor ( AT2R ) . Renal tissues of Vpr transgenic and Tg26 ( HIVAN ) mice displayed enhanced phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K . DB09026 , a renin inhibitor attenuated phosphorylation of both P42345 and p70S6K in renal tissues of HIVAN mice . Interestingly , Angiotensin Receptor Type I ( AT1R ) blockade did not modulate renal tissue phosphorylation of P42345 in HIVAN mice ; on the other hand , AT2R blockade attenuated renal tissue phosphorylation of P42345 in HIVAN mice . In vitro studies , both renin and Ang II displayed enhanced mouse tubular cell ( P04629 ) phosphorylation of p70S6K in a dose dependent manner . HIV/ P04629 also displayed enhanced phosphorylation of both P42345 and p70S6K ; interestingly this effect of HIV was further enhanced by losartan ( an AT1R blocker ) . On the other hand , AT2R blockade attenuated HIV-induced tubular cell phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K , whereas , AT2R agonist enhanced phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K . These findings indicate that HIV stimulates P42345 pathway in HIVAN through the activation of renin angiotensin system via AT2R . A transgenic platform for testing drugs intended for reversal of cardiac remodeling identifies a novel 11βHSD1 inhibitor rescuing hypertrophy independently of re-vascularization . RATIONALE : Rescuing adverse myocardial remodeling is an unmet clinical goal and , correspondingly , pharmacological means for its intended reversal are urgently needed . OBJECTIVES : To harness a newly-developed experimental model recapitulating progressive heart failure development for the discovery of new drugs capable of reversing adverse remodeling . METHODS AND RESULTS : A P15692 -based conditional transgenic system was employed in which an induced perfusion deficit and a resultant compromised cardiac function lead to progressive remodeling and eventually heart failure . Ability of candidate drugs administered at sequential remodeling stages to reverse hypertrophy , enlarged LV size and improve cardiac function was monitored . Arguing for clinical relevance of the experimental system , clinically-used drugs operating on the P00797 -Angiotensin- DB04630 -System ( RAAS ) , namely , the P12821 inhibitor Enalapril and the direct renin inhibitor Aliskerin fully reversed remodeling . Remodeling reversal by these drugs was not accompanied by neovascularization and reached a point-of-no-return . Similarly , the PPARγ agonist Pioglitazone was proven capable of reversing all aspects of cardiac remodeling without affecting the vasculature . Extending the arsenal of remodeling-reversing drugs to pathways other than RAAS , a specific inhibitor of 11β-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11β HSD1 ) , a key enzyme required for generating active glucocorticoids , fully rescued myocardial hypertrophy . This was associated with mitigating the hypertrophy-associated gene signature , including reversing the myosin heavy chain isoform switch but in a pattern distinguishable from that associated with neovascularization-induced reversal . CONCLUSIONS : A system was developed suitable for identifying novel remodeling-reversing drugs operating in different pathways and for gaining insights into their mechanisms of action , exemplified here by uncoupling their vascular affects . Moving beyond chemotherapy : novel cytostatic agents for malignant mesothelioma . It is now known that vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) are autocrine growth factors in malignant mesothelioma ; epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is also highly overexpressed . Cytotoxic drugs that target these growth factors offer fresh potential for the treatment of mesothelioma . Clinical trials have recently been initiated to evaluate the anti-tumour activity of the P15692 inhibitors SU5416 , bevacizumab and thalidomide . ZD1839 ( DB00317 , AstraZeneca ) , an inhibitor of P00533 tyrosine kinase , is also being evaluated . Two clinical trials are planned to evaluate the two PDGF inhibitors Gleevec ( Imatinib mesylate , STI-571 , Novartis Pharmaceuticals ) and PTK787 ( Novartis Pharmaceuticals ) . Silencing alpha-fetoprotein inhibits P15692 and P08253 /9 production in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell . P02771 not only serves as a diagnostic marker for liver cancer , but also posses a variety of biological functions . However , the role of P02771 on tumor angiogenesis and cell invasion remains incompletely understood . In this study , we aimed to evaluate if P02771 can regulate the major angiogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases in human liver cancer cells . P02771 silencing was achieved by Stealth RNAi . Expression of P02771 was examined by a full-automatic electrochemistry luminescence immunity analyzer . Expression of P15692 , P35968 , P14780 , and P08253 was examined by Western blot and immunocytochemistry . Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay . Angiogenesis was detected by in vitro angiogenesis assay kit . Silencing of P02771 led to an increased apoptosis , which was associated with a decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 , matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 . These results suggest that P02771 may play a regulatory role on angiogenesis and cell invasion during liver cancer development . The role of tumor suppressor dysregulation in prostate cancer progression . P10275 activity is essential for prostate cancer development and progression . While there are classically defined roles for the retinoblastoma ( P06400 ) and p53 tumor suppressor pathways in maintenance of cell cycle control and the DNA damage response , recent studies have demonstrated a direct role of these two pathways in regulating AR expression and function . While the role of Pten deregulation in prostate cancer has provided much insight in to the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer initiation and progression , emerging roles for P06400 and p53 are likely to further expand upon our understanding of tumor suppressor/nuclear receptor interaction . As disconnecting mitogenic signaling from AR-mediated gene transcription underlies the progression to castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , functional inactivation of these two tumor suppressor pathways represents one mechanism through which AR protein levels can be upregulated and AR-mediated gene transcription can become aberrant . Importantly , recent advances in small molecule inhibitor design and discovery have led to the identification of agents capable of targeting these two prominent pathways and restoring the function of deregulated wild-type P06400 and p53 protein . While such agents have undergone extensive study in many solid tumor types , the additional importance of P06400 and p53 in restraining transcription of the AR gene within the prostate provides impetus for examining how loss of these two tumor suppressor proteins can facilitate transition of prostate cancers to CRPC . As will be reviewed in this article , restoration of P06400 and p53 functions are not only important in regard to shortterm cell cycle regulation and response to genomic stresses , but likely have direct implications for deregulation of the AR locus . Sporadic fundic gland polyps : an immunohistochemical study of their antigenic profile . Fundic Gland Polyps ( FGPs ) are small sessile ( 2-5 mm ) , usually multiple polyps arising in the gastric , acid-secreting mucosa of disputed histogenesis . They have been described in a sporadic form , prevalently in middle aged females , or associated with familial adenomatosis coli-Gardner 's syndrome . We performed an immunohistochemical study on 24 sporadic FGPs , using monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) against differentiation markers , class II MHC antigens ( HLA-DR ) , oncofetal and proliferation antigens , aimed to characterize the antigenic profile of the polyps . A preliminary cytogenetic study on five polyps was also done , using an in situ culture method after collagenase treatment . Cytokeratins 8-18 ( P62158 5.2 MAb ) and 20 ( IT-Ks 20.8 MAb ) , Epithelial Membrane Antigen ( P15941 ) and Chromogranin A were normally expressed by FGPs . FGPs did not express HLA II DR . FGPs did not react with an anti- P06731 MAb ( F6 ) , but they were frequently positive ( 22/24 , 91.6 % ) with B72.3 MAb ( reacting with the cancer-associated mucin epitope sialyl-Tn ) . The PC10 MAb ( against P12004 or cyclin ) showed enhanced expression in the deep glandular-cystic compartment of FGPs ; the P12004 index of FGPs was significantly higher than in normal fundic mucosa . The cytogenetic study on the 5 cases analysed , revealed a normal karyotype . We have demonstrated that FGPs express in the paranuclear zone the sialyl-Tn epitope , a side-chain sugar normally masqued in adult gastric mucins , thus revealing an alteration in mucin synthesis ; FGPs ' higher proliferation index as compared with normal fundic mucosa supports the hypothesis of their hyperproliferative nature . Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors in the central nervous system in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) prolongs survival in the mutant P00441 transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) , whereas dysregulation of P15692 through deletion of its hypoxia-regulatory element causes motor neuron degeneration in mice . We investigated the expression of P15692 and its major agonist receptors in the normal central nervous system and in patients with P35858 . Immunohistochemistry demonstrated similar expression patterns of P15692 and P15692 receptor 2 ( P35968 ) in the spinal cord with finely punctate staining of the neuropil and strong expression in anterior horn cells ( AHCs ) . Granular staining on the surface of some AHCs , similar to that seen with synaptic markers , suggested synaptic labeling . P35968 staining was reduced in the neuropil of P35858 cases ( p=0.018 ) associated with a reduction of synaptophysin but not P60880 expression . A greater proportion of AHCs in P35858 cases showed low expression of P15692 ( p=0.006 ) and P35968 ( p=0.009 ) compared with controls . Expression of P15692 and P35968 was confirmed by Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( QPCR ) . The similar expression patterns of P15692 and P35968 suggests autocrine/paracrine effects on spinal motor neurons , and the reduction in their expression seen in P35858 cases would support the hypothesis that , as in mouse models of the disease , reduced P15692 signaling may play a role in the pathogenesis of P35858 . ShRNA silencing glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer . P49841 ( GSK-3β ) , a serine/threonine protein kinase , plays a vital role in the tumorigenesis of many cancers , but its role in pancreatic cancer remains unknown . In this study , we showed that GSK-3β was aberrantly activated in pancreatic cancer . GSK-3β knockdown resulted in arrested proliferation and increased apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines . Expression of Bcl-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) decreased significantly in a GSK-3β knockdown group . In a xenograft tumor model , GSK-3β knockdown inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis . Our study showed that GSK-3β may become a promising therapeutic target for human pancreatic cancer . Benign mixed tumor of the skin , hypercellular variant : a case report . A 71-year-old man presented with a slowly growing 2.0x2.0x1.0 cm scalp lesion that was surgically removed . Microscopic examination showed a well-circumscribed dermally located tumor composed of ductal elements lined by double to multiple cell layers of bland cuboidal inner cells and elongated spindled outer cells with areas showing cribriform and solid growth patterns . Some cells showed prominent cytoplasmic clearing . A few mitotic figures are noted ranging from 1-2 mitotic figure/10 hpf . There are also foci of squamous differentiation as well as occasional mature adipocytes . The background stroma was predominantly sclerotic with only small area of myxoid background ( confirmed by Hale 's colloidal iron ) . Immunohistochemical studies revealed positive immunoreactivity for P15941 , P06731 , CD117 , HWMK , LWMK , CK7 , P10275 and S100 in the ductal ( epithelial ) cells and positive immunereactivity for calponin , SMA , CK 5/6 and p63 in the myoepithelial component . No immunoreactivity for Brst-2 , ER , PR and CK20 was noted . MIB-1 showed mildly increased proliferrative index highlighting 5 % of the nuclei . The overall morphology and immunohistochemical profile are that of a benign cutanoues mixed tumor ( chondroid syringoma ) . Given the unusual striking celluarlity , we suggest to subclassify this as a hyper-cellular variant . DB00203 inhibits calcineurin/ Q13469 -mediated cyclin A expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells . AIMS : To examine whether calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway leads to proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( PASMCs ) by regulating cell cycle proteins and whether the phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) inhibitor sildenafil affects calcineurin/NFAT-induced cell proliferation . MAIN METHODS : A [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay was used to examine DNA synthesis ( cell proliferation ) ; cyclin A and Q13469 expressions were determined by Western blot . P24941 ( P24941 ) activity was measured with an in vitro kinase activity assay , and calcineurin and NFAT activity were evaluated using a calcineurin assay kit and a luciferase activity assay , respectively . A chemical inhibitor or siRNA transfection was used to inhibit calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway . KEY FINDINGS : Serotonin dose-dependently stimulated cyclin A expression in PASMCs . This effect was accompanied by dose-dependent increases in P24941 activity and the rate of DNA synthesis . At the same time , PASMCs treated with serotonin showed dose-dependent activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway . Inhibition of calcineurin activity by cyclosporine A or loss of Q13469 protein by siRNA transfection abolished serotonin-induced cyclin A expression and consequent P24941 activation and DNA synthesis . We further found that pretreatment of cells with sildenafil suppressed serotonin-triggered activation of calcineurin/ Q13469 signaling pathway and resultant cyclin A expression , P24941 activation and cell proliferation , while the presence of DT-3 [ a specific protein kinase G ( PKG ) peptide inhibitor ] reversed the effects of sildenafil on PASMCs . SIGNIFICANCE : Our study suggests that enhanced PKG activity suppresses calcineurin/ Q13469 cascade-mediated cyclin A expression , P24941 activation and PASMC proliferation to contribute to the overall effects of sildenafil in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension . DB08875 inhibits prostate cancer growth and prevents tumor-induced bone lesions . PURPOSE : DB08875 , an orally available multityrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( MET ) and P15692 receptor 2 ( P35968 ) , induces resolution of bone scan lesions in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases . The purpose of this study was to determine whether cabozantinib elicited a direct antitumor effect , an indirect effect through modulating bone , or both . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Using human prostate cancer xenograft studies in mice , we determined the impact of cabozantinib on tumor growth in soft tissue and bone . In vitro studies with cabozantinib were performed using ( i ) prostate cancer cell lines to evaluate its impact on cell growth , invasive ability , and MET and ( ii ) osteoblast cell lines to evaluate its impact on viability and differentiation and P35968 . RESULTS : DB08875 inhibited progression of multiple prostate cancer cell lines ( Ace-1 , C4-2B , and LuCaP 35 ) in bone metastatic and soft tissue murine models of prostate cancer , except for PC-3 prostate cancer cells in which it inhibited only subcutaneous growth . DB08875 directly inhibited prostate cancer cell viability and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and inhibited cell invasion in vitro . DB08875 had a dose-dependent biphasic effect on osteoblast activity and inhibitory effect on osteoclast production in vitro that was reflected in vivo . It blocked MET and P35968 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells and osteoblast-like cells , respectively . CONCLUSION : These data indicate that cabozantinib has direct antitumor activity , and that its ability to modulate osteoblast activity may contribute to its antitumor efficacy . Noncatalytic function of P27361 /2 can promote Raf/MEK/ P29323 -mediated growth arrest signaling . Kinase activity is known as the key biochemical property of MAPKs . Here , we report that P27361 /2 also utilizes its noncatalytic function to mediate certain signal transductions . Sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ P29323 pathway induces growth arrest , accompanied by changes in cell cycle regulators ( decreased retinoblastoma phosphorylation , Q01094 down-regulation , and/or P38936 (CIP1) up-regulation ) and cell type-specific changes in morphology and expression of c-Myc or P07949 in the human tumor lines LNCaP , U251 , and TT . Ablation of P27361 /2 by RNA interference abrogated all these effects . However , active site-disabled P29323 mutants ( P27361 -K71R , P28482 -K52R , and P28482 -D147A ) , which competitively inhibit activation of endogenous P27361 /2 , could not block Raf/MEK-induced growth arrest as well as changes in the cell cycle regulators , although they effectively blocked phosphorylation of the P27361 /2 catalytic activity readouts , p90(RSK) and ELK1 , as well as the cell type-specific changes . Because this indicated a potential noncatalytic P27361 /2 function , we generated stable lines of the tumor cells in which both P27361 and P28482 were significantly knocked down , and we further investigated the possibility using rat-derived kinase-deficient P29323 mutants ( P28482 -K52R and P28482 -T183A/Y185F ) that were not targeted by human small hairpin RNA . Indeed , P28482 -K52R selectively restored Raf-induced growth inhibitory signaling in P27361 /2-depleted cells , as manifested by regained cellular ability to undergo growth arrest and to control the cell cycle regulators without affecting c-Myc and morphology . However , P28482 -T183A/Y185F was less effective , indicating the requirement of TEY site phosphorylation . Our study suggests that functions of P27361 /2 other than its " canonical " kinase activity are also involved in the pathway-mediated growth arrest signaling . Opposed effects of lithium on the MEK- P29323 pathway in neural cells : inhibition in astrocytes and stimulation in neurons by GSK3 independent mechanisms . DB01356 is widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder , but despite its proven therapeutic efficacy , the molecular mechanisms of action are not fully understood . The present study was undertaken to explore lithium effects of the MEK/ P29323 cascade of protein kinases in astrocytes and neurons . In asynchronously proliferating rat cortical astrocytes , lithium decreased time- and dose-dependently the phosphorylation of MEK and P29323 , with 1 mM concentrations achieving 60 and 50 % inhibition of P29323 and MEK , respectively , after a 7-day exposure . DB01356 also inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest . In serum-deprived , quiescent astrocytes , pre-exposure to lithium resulted in the inhibition of cell cycle re-entry as stimulated by the mitogen endothelin-1 : under this experimental setting , lithium did not affect the rapid , peak phosphorylation of MEK taking place after 3-5 min , but was effective in inhibiting the long-term , sustained phosphorylation of MEK . DB01356 inhibition of the astrocyte MEK/ P29323 pathway was independent of inositol depletion . Further , compound SB216763 inhibited Tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and stabilized cytosolic beta-catenin , consistent with the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta ( P49841 ) , but failed to reproduce lithium effects on MEK and P29323 phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest . In cerebellar granule neurons , millimolar concentrations of lithium enhanced MEK and P29323 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner , again through an inositol and P49841 independent mechanism . These opposing effects in astrocytes and neurons make lithium treatment a promising strategy to favour neural repair and reduce reactive gliosis after traumatic injury . A dose-ranging study of cabozantinib in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases . BACKGROUND : DB08875 is an oral MET/ P35968 inhibitor . A recent phase II study of cabozantinib ( 100 mg daily ) showed improved bone scans in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , but adverse events ( AE ) caused frequent dose reductions . This study was designed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of cabozantinib at lower starting doses . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : An adaptive design was used to determine the lowest active daily dose among 60 , 40 , and 20 mg . The primary endpoint was week 6 bone scan response , defined as ≥30 % decrease in bone scan lesion area . The secondary endpoint was change in circulating tumor cells ( CTC ) . RESULTS : Among 11 evaluable subjects enrolled at 40 mg , there were 9 partial responses ( PR ) , 1 complete response , and 1 stable disease ( SD ) . Of 10 subjects subsequently enrolled at 20 mg , there were 1 PR , 5 SDs , and 4 with progressive disease . Among 13 subjects enrolled on the 40 mg expansion cohort , there were 6 PRs and 7 SDs . No subjects required dose reduction or treatment interruption at 6 or 12 weeks ; 3 subjects at dose level 0 discontinued due to AEs by 12 weeks . At 40 mg , median treatment duration was 27 weeks . 58 % of subjects with ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL at baseline converted to < 5 . CONCLUSIONS : DB08875 40 mg daily was associated with a high rate of bone scan response . DB08875 40 mg daily was associated with better tolerability than previously reported for cabozantinib 100 mg daily . These observations informed the design of phase III studies of cabozantinib in mCRPC . DB00203 induces angiogenic response in human coronary arteriolar endothelial cells through the expression of thioredoxin , hemeoxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor . This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) inhibitor , sildenafil , on angiogenic response in human coronary arteriolar endothelial cells ( HCAEC ) . The cells exposed to sildenafil ( 1-20 microM ) demonstrated significantly accelerated tubular morphogenesis with the induction of thioredoxin-1 ( P10599 -1 ) , hemeoxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) and P15692 . DB00203 induced P15692 and angiopoietin specific receptors such as P35968 , Tie-1 and Tie-2 . This angiogenic response was repressed by tinprotoporphyrin IX ( SnPP ) , an inhibitor of P09601 enzyme activity . DB00203 below 1 muM has no angiogenic effect as evidenced by reduced tuborogenesis . DB00203 along with SnPP inhibited both P15692 and Q15389 ( Ang-1 ) protein expression . Therefore our results demonstrated for the first time that sildenafil is a very potent pro-angiogenic factor . In-vitro antiproliferative activities and kinase inhibitory potencies of meridianin derivatives . Marine alkaloid meridianin G derivatives , substituted on the pyrimidine ring by aryl groups , were evaluated for their kinase inhibitory potencies and their in-vitro antiproliferative activities . The derivatives were tested toward a panel of nine protein kinases ( P35968 , IGF-1R , c- DB00134 , P07949 , c-Src , c-Abl , PKA , P24941 /cyclin A , and HER-1 ) and their in-vitro antiproliferative activities were evaluated toward a human fibroblast primary culture and two human solid cancer cell lines ( MCF-7 and PA 1 ) . Despite weak kinase inhibitory potencies , high in-vitro antiproliferative activities were found for compounds 5 , 7 , 12 , and 14 , which do not interfere with the PA 1 cell cycle and may be considered as direct cytolysis or apoptosis inducers . [ Functional characteristics of calcium-sensitive adenylyl cyclase of ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis ] . DB01373 -sensitive forms of adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) were revealed in most vertebrates and invertebrates and also in some unicellular organisms , in particular ciliates . We have shown for the first time that calcium cations influence the AC activity of ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis . These cations at the concentrations of 0.2-20 microM stimulated the enzyme activity , and maximum of catalytic effect was observed at 2 microM Ca2+ . DB01373 cations at a concentrations of 100 microM or higher inhibited the AC activity . P62158 antagonists W-5 and W-7 at the concentrations of 20-100 microM inhibited the catalytic effect induced by 5 microM Ca2+ and blocked the effect at higher concentrations of Ca2+ . DB00477 , another calmodulin antagonist , reduced Ca2+-stimulated AC activity only at the concentrations of 200-1000 microM . AC stimulating effects of serotonin , P01133 and DB02527 increased in the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ . AC stimulating effects of P01133 , DB02527 and insulin decreased in the presence of 100 microM Ca2+ , and AC stimulating effect of DB02527 decreased also in the presence of calmodulin antagonists ( 1 mM ) . At the same time , stimulating effect of D-glucose in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin antagonists did not change essentially . The data obtained speak in favor of the presence of calcium-sensitive forms of AC in ciliate T. pyriformis which mediate enzyme stimulation by P01133 , DB02527 , insulin , and serotonin . Profile of cabozantinib and its potential in the treatment of advanced medullary thyroid cancer . Medullary thyroid cancer is an uncommon malignancy for which until recently little effective treatment existed . It is often characterized by mutation and overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinases P07949 ( rearranged during transfection ) , P35968 ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ) and MET ( mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor ) , which make attractive targets for drug development . DB08875 is an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor which blocks MET , VEGRF2 and P07949 , and has shown considerable activity in medullary thyroid cancer in a Phase III trial , including in heavily pretreated patients . Its novel combination of vascular endothelial growth factor and MET inhibition is believed to address the MET escape pathway , which is thought to be the cause of nonsustained tumor responses resulting from inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor alone . Gene transfer of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 protects PC12 cells from injury : involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathways . Gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases may utilize the expression of neurotrophic factors because of their potential to promote survival and regeneration of injured neuronal cells . Increasing numbers of these factors are being considered for gene transfer , but their specificity and efficacy in neuroprotection are greatly variable . The major aims of this study were to carry out gene transfer of various neurotrophic factors and investigate their mechanisms of action as well as their protective effects on the viability of rat pheochromocytoma ( PC12 ) cells . We used glutamate , S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine ( P60880 ) , and staurosporine to induce excitatory damage , oxidative stress , and apoptosis , respectively , because these mechanisms are thought to participate in various disease processes leading to degeneration of cells . We utilized adenovirus vectors for efficient gene transfer of trophic factors ( glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor [ P39905 ] and cardiotrophin-1 [ Q16619 ] ) or calbindin-D28k . We found that P39905 and Q16619 gene transfers were equally effective in saving PC12 cells from injury , but calbindin expression did not show any beneficial effects . P39905 gene transfer was much more efficient in protecting PC12 cells from damage than direct P39905 administration . The protection by P39905 expression against staurosporine was mediated through both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MAPK kinase ; MEK ) pathways , but only the MEK pathway was involved in the protection against P60880 . In contrast , the protective effect of P39905 against glutamate toxicity was independent of these P07949 -dependent signal transduction pathways . A recombinant single-chain P13232 /HGFbeta hybrid cytokine induces juxtacrine interactions of the P13232 and P14210 ( c- DB00134 ) receptors and stimulates the proliferation of CFU- P28222 , CLPs , and pre-pro-B cells . A novel recombinant interleukin-7/hepatocyte growth factor beta-chain ( P13232 /HGFbeta ) hybrid cytokine was constructed as a single chain ( sc ) composed of P13232 and HGFbeta connected by a flexible linker . Unlike recombinant ( r ) P13232 , which stimulated pro-B cells and pre-B cells only , scIL-7/HGFbeta stimulated the proliferation of pre-pro-B cells , common lymphoid progenitors ( CLPs ) , and colony-forming unit ( CFU ) - P28222 in cultures of P13232 -/- mouse BM cells . When injected in vivo , 3- to 4-fold more splenic B-lineage cells appeared in recipients of bone marrow ( BM ) cells from the scIL-7/HGFbeta-stimulated cultures than from rIL-7-stimulated cultures . Moreover , on a per-cell basis , scIL-7/HGFbeta culture-generated cells produced 16- to 20-fold more BM and splenic B-lineage cells than did normal BM cells . Antibody blocking , receptor phosphorylation , and confocal microscopy demonstrated that scIL-7/HGFbeta signals though both the P13232 and P14210 ( c- DB00134 ) receptors , which form IL-7R/c- DB00134 complexes on the surface of CLPs and pre-pro-B cells . In addition , the IL-7Ralpha chain , gammac chain , and c- DB00134 were coisolated from purified CLPs and pre-pro-B cells on scIL-7/HGFbeta affinity gels , indicating that they are major components of the P13232 /HGFbeta receptor . Hence , the present results demonstrate that the P13232 /HGFbeta hybrid cytokine efficiently and selectively stimulates the most primitive B-lineage precursors in BM by inducing juxtacrine interactions between the P13232 and c- DB00134 receptors . Multiple antigenic polypeptide composed of heparanase B‑cell epitopes shrinks human hepatocellular carcinoma in mice . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti‑growth effect of the self‑designed multiple antigenic polypeptide ( Q96HU1 ) vaccine comprising B‑cell epitopes of heparanase ( Q9Y251 ) on HCC97‑H hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) in mice . The polyclonal antibodies against the B‑cell epitopes of Q9Y251 were prepared by immunizing rabbits with freshly synthesized Q96HU1 vaccine . HCC‑bearing models were constructed on BALB/c nude mice . Anti‑ Q96HU1 antibodies were administrered to the models to assess the effects on Q9Y251 activity , HCC growth , the expression of P15692 / P09038 and the value of micro‑vessel density ( P53602 ) . The anti‑ Q96HU1 antibodies were harvested , purified and identified . These antibodies were able to specifically bind with the dominant epitopes of the precursor protein and large subunit monomer of Q9Y251 , decrease Q9Y251 activity , suppress the expressions of P15692 and P09038 , reduce the P53602 , and markedly shrink the HCC volume . Based on these findings , Q96HU1 vaccine based on the B‑cell epitopes of Q9Y251 seemed to provide theoretical evidence for further study of the synthesized Q9Y251 Q96HU1 vaccine in the treatment of HCC . Role of O60674 - P40763 in O60603 -mediated tissue factor expression . P13726 ( TF ) is a core protein with an essential function in the coagulation cascade that maintains the homeostasis of the blood vessels . TF not only participates in neointima formation , but also causes the development of atherosclerosis . This study investigated the mechanism regulating TF expression in macrophages using Pam3 CSK4 , a O60603 ligand . Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression in two types of macrophages ( Raw264.7 and BMDM ) , but not in O60603 KO mice derived BMDM . Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression was inhibited by pretreatment with pan-JAK inhibitor or O60674 inhibitor AG490 . O60674 knock-down by siRNA inhibited Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression . Pam3 CSK4 stimulated P40763 phosphorylation ( S727 ) , while P40763 knock-down by siRNA reduced Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression . These results suggest that Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression is regulated by the O60674 - P40763 signaling pathway . Pam3 CSK4 , unlike increased TF expression , significantly decreased P41220 expression , while P41220 overexpression decreased Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression . Inhibition of TF by P41220 WT did not occur in mutants with flawed Q99697 domains . We also investigated the correlation between P41220 and P40763 phosphorylation . P41220 knock-down elevated Pam3 CSK4 induced P40763 phosphorylation , but P41220 overexpression had the opposite effect on P40763 phosphorylation . These results suggest that , while Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression is regulated by O60674 - P40763 signaling , P41220 is a negative regulator targeted to P40763 . DB01356 inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity and mimics wingless signalling in intact cells . BACKGROUND : Exposing eukaryotic cells to lithium ions ( Li+ ) during development has marked effects on cell fate and organization . The phenotypic consequences of Li+ treatment on Xenopus embryos and sporulating Dictyostelium are similar to the effects of inhibition or disruption , respectively , of a highly conserved protein serine/threonine kinase , glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK-3 ) . In Drosophila , the GSK-3 homologue is encoded by zw3sgg , a segment-polarity gene involved in embryogenesis that acts downstream of wg . In higher eukaryotes , GSK-3 has been implicated in signal transduction pathways downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases . RESULTS : We investigated the effect of Li+ on the activity of the GSK-3 family . At physiological doses , Li+ inhibits the activity of human P49841 and Drosophila Zw3Sgg , but has no effect on other protein kinases . The effect of Li+ on GSK-3 is reversible in vitro . Treatment of cells with Li+ inhibits GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau . Li+ treatment of Drosophila S2 cells and rat PC12 cells induces accumulation of cytoplasmic Armadillo/beta-catenin , demonstrating that Li+ can mimic Wingless signalling in intact cells , consistent with its inhibition of GSK-3 . CONCLUSIONS : Li+ acts as a specific inhibitor of the GSK-3 family of protein kinases in vitro and in intact cells , and mimics Wingless signalling . This reveals a possible molecular mechanism of Li+ action on development and differentiation . Human platelet antigen genotype is associated with progression of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C . Although progression of fibrosis in the chronic hepatitis C depends on environmental , viral , and host factors , genetic polymorphisms have been associated recently with this progression , including the expression of integrins , adhesion proteins . Some integrins expressed on the platelet membrane show polymorphic antigenic determinants called human platelet antigens ( Q9Y251 ) , where the major ones are Q9Y251 -1 , -3 , -5 . The association between HCV infection and Q9Y251 -5b has been demonstrated . Similarly , the Q9Y251 profile could determine if Q9Y251 is related to progression of fibrosis . The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between the frequencies of Q9Y251 -1 , -3 , and -5 and degree of fibrosis in HCV-infected patients . Genomic DNA from 143 HCV-infected patients was used as the source for Q9Y251 genotyping by PCR-SSP or PCR-RFLP . Progression of fibrosis was evaluated using the METAVIR scoring system , and the patients were grouped according to degree of fibrosis into P55008 ( n = 81 , with F1 , portal fibrosis without septa or F2 , few septa ) and G2 ( n = 62 , with P13726 , numerous septa , or F4 , cirrhosis ) . Statistical analysis was performed using the proportional odds model . The genotypic frequency of Q9Y251 -1a/1b was significantly higher in the patients in G2 . To evaluate the influence of the time of infection to the development of fibrosis and its effect on the genetic factor Q9Y251 -1 , 96 patients from 143 studied were evaluated considering the time of HCV infection , and these results suggest that the Q9Y251 -1a/1b genotype promotes the development of fibrosis in HCV infection with time . DB08875 ( DB05153 ) , a novel MET and P35968 inhibitor , simultaneously suppresses metastasis , angiogenesis , and tumor growth . The signaling pathway of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) is important for cell growth , survival , and motility and is functionally linked to the signaling pathway of P15692 , which is widely recognized as a key effector in angiogenesis and cancer progression . Dysregulation of the MET/ P15692 axis is found in a number of human malignancies and has been associated with tumorigenesis . DB08875 ( DB05153 ) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor with potent activity toward MET and P15692 receptor 2 ( P35968 ) , as well as a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases that have also been implicated in tumor pathobiology , including P07949 , P10721 , P30530 , and P36888 . Treatment with cabozantinib inhibited MET and P35968 phosphorylation in vitro and in tumor models in vivo and led to significant reductions in cell invasion in vitro . In mouse models , cabozantinib dramatically altered tumor pathology , resulting in decreased tumor and endothelial cell proliferation coupled with increased apoptosis and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in breast , lung , and glioma tumor models . Importantly , treatment with cabozantinib did not increase lung tumor burden in an experimental model of metastasis , which has been observed with inhibitors of P15692 signaling that do not target MET . Collectively , these data suggest that cabozantinib is a promising agent for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in cancers with dysregulated MET and VEGFR signaling . DB08875 ( DB05153 ) for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic progressive medullary thyroid cancer . DB08875 ( DB05153 ) is an oral multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor manufactured by Exelixis Inc. , CA , USA . It mainly inhibits three tyrosine kinase receptors : MET , P35968 and P07949 . In both preclinical and clinical studies it has been shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis , invasiveness and metastases . The most frequent side effects are fatigue , diarrhea , decreased appetite , nausea , weight loss and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia . A Phase III clinical trial ( EXAM study ) of DB05153 versus placebo in advanced and progressive medullary thyroid cancer showed a 28 versus 0 % overall response rate and a progression-free survival of 11.2 versus 4.0 months ( hazard ratio : 0.28 ; 95 % CI : 0.19-0.40 ; p < 0.0001 ) in patients treated with cabozantinib and placebo , respectively . The drug has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of advanced/progressive metastatic medullary thyroid cancer in the USA . The P15941 is now evaluating its approval in Europe . DB08875 : a MET , P07949 , and P35968 tyrosine kinase inhibitor . DB08875 is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against MET , P35968 , P36888 , c- P10721 , and P07949 . Activity of cabozantinib toward a broad range of tumor models could be detected in several preclinical studies . Of note , cabozantinib decreases metastasis potential and tumor invasiveness when compared with placebo or agents that target VEGFR and have no activity against MET . Clinical phase I and II studies with cabozantinib have been conducted in various malignancies including medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) , NSCLC , breast , ovarian , pancreatic , and prostate cancer . In P04629 , gain of function mutations of P07949 are central for tumorigenesis . Hereditary forms of P04629 ( MEN II ) are caused by germline mutations of P07949 , in sporadic P04629 in up to 50 % of cases P07949 mutations occur . Additionally , activating molecular changes in VEGFR and MET pathways have also been implicated in P04629 progression . Clinical responses with cabozantinib in P04629 could be observed in early clinical trials , and following confirmation of clinical benefit in a randomized phase III trial , cabozantinib gained FDA approval for first-line treatment of advanced P04629 in 2012 . In prostate cancer models , MET expression increases with androgen ablation and clinical progression of bone and lymph node metastasis . A phase II trial with cabozantinib also showed very promising response rates in patients with metastatic prostate cancer . Therefore , randomized phase III studies are currently ongoing to validate the efficacy of cabozantinib in heavily pretreated prostate cancer patients . DB08875 and prostate cancer : inhibiting seed and disrupting soil ? Treatment with cabozantinib , an inhibitor of MET and P35968 signaling , has demonstrated clinical benefit in early trials in men with metastatic prostate cancer . Preclinical evidence suggests that cabozantinib can kill cancer cell seeds while disrupting angiogenesis and stromal cells in the metastatic soil . [ The role of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in pathogenesis of pancreatic pseudocysts ] . The investigation was conducted in 47 patients , operated on for pancreatic pseudocysts ( PP ) . Activity of matrix metalloproteinases ( P14780 ) and content of their tissue inhibitor ( P16035 ) were determined in the blood serum for estimation of inflammatory factors , hypoxia severity and state of the pancreatic tissue reconstruction . High activity of P14780 and P16035 in presence of PP types I and II was noted in patients , what , probably , is caused by compensation reaction , directed towards inhibition of the collagen system destruction ( predominantly of collagen type IV ) and prevention of further reconstruction of pancreatic connective tissue . While progressing of pancreatic fibrosis the P14780 activity and the P16035 level have lowered in comparison with these indices while its absence . In PP type III the P14780 activity was by 83.6 % higher , than in a control group , but , by 51.4 and 35.1 % lower , than in PP types I and IV . In all the patients endothelial dysfunction with endothelial injury was observed , witnessed by significant rising of the P15692 content in the blood serum . It have created favorable conditions for pancreatic tissue remodeling while parenchymal defect have been constituted by tissue , owing lower level of organization , including a cicatricial one . In cases of cellular repeated affection more activation of pancreatic stellate cells and enhancement of production of extracellular matrix component were noted . A phase I study of cabozantinib ( DB05153 ) in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer . BACKGROUND : DB08875 targets tyrosine kinases including MET , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) receptor 2 , and rearranged during transfection ( P07949 ) . Differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) is a tumor type that may be sensitive to cabozantinib . Therefore , we evaluated cabozantinib in a cohort of heavily pretreated patients with metastatic DTC . METHODS : This single-arm open-label phase I trial assessed the safety , tolerability , and antitumor activity of cabozantinib in DTC patients taking part in a drug-drug interaction study . Adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or surgically unresectable DTC ( including papillary , follicular , or Hürthle cell ) were enrolled . Patients received daily oral dosing of 140 mg cabozantinib . Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events ( AEs ) , vital signs , electrocardiograms , laboratory tests , and concomitant medications . Tumor response by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan was investigator assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.0 . RESULTS : The study enrolled 15 patients who had failed standard radioactive iodine therapy . Patients had received a median of two prior systemic agents , and 11 patients ( 73 % ) had previously received at least one P15692 pathway inhibiting therapy . Common AEs included diarrhea , nausea , fatigue , and decreased appetite . Partial response was reported in eight patients ( 53 % ) . Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were not reached . CONCLUSIONS : DB08875 demonstrates a safety profile similar to other multitargeted VEGFR inhibitors in advanced DTC patients . The antitumor activity observed in this study warrants further investigation of cabozantinib in patients with advanced DTC . Raddeanin A , a triterpenoid saponin isolated from Anemone raddeana , suppresses the angiogenesis and growth of human colorectal tumor by inhibiting P35968 signaling . Raddeanin A ( RA ) is an active triterpenoid saponin from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb , Anemone raddeana Regel . It was previously reported that RA possessed attractive antitumor activity through inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of multiple cancer cells . However , whether RA can inhibit angiogenesis , an essential step in cancer development , remains unknown . In this study , we found that RA could significantly inhibit human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) proliferation , motility , migration , and tube formation . RA also dramatically reduced angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) , restrained the trunk angiogenesis in zebrafish , and suppressed angiogenesis and growth of human HCT-15 colorectal cancer xenograft in mice . Western blot assay showed that RA suppressed P15692 -induced phosphorylation of P35968 and its downstream protein kinases including PLCγ1 , O60674 , Q05397 , Src , and Akt . Molecular docking simulation indicated that RA formed hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions within the DB00171 binding pocket of P35968 kinase domain . Our study firstly provides the evidence that RA has high antiangiogenic potency and explores its molecular basis , demonstrating that RA is a potential agent or lead candidate for antiangiogenic cancer therapy . Nongenomic , glucocorticoid receptor-mediated regulation of serotonin transporter cell surface expression in embryonic stem cell derived serotonergic neurons . Depressive disorders have been linked to the combined dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) -axis and the serotonergic system . The Q9Y251 -axis and serotonergic ( 5-HT ) neurons exert reciprocal regulatory actions . It has been reported that glucocorticoid-glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) signaling influences serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) transcription but data also points to the fact that 5-HTT expression is regulated nongenomically via redistribution of 5-HTT from the cell surface into intracellular compartments . In order to analyze the acute effects of glucocorticoids on 5-HTT cell surface localization we differentiated serotonergic neurons from mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells derived from the C57BL/6N blastocysts . These postmitotic 5-HT neurons express all relevant serotonergic markers following the application of a growth factor-based differentiation protocol . Increasing concentrations of the GR agonist dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) resulted in enhanced , dose-dependent 5-HTT cell surface localization in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide already 1h after incubation . Inhibition of GR function by the specific GR-antagonist mifepristone abolished the increase in 5-HTT cell surface localization . Hence , our data account for a nongenomic upregulation of 5-HTT cell surface expression by glucocorticoid-GR interaction which likely constitutes a rapid physiological response to increased levels of glucocorticoids as seen during stress . Taken together , we provide a cellular model to analyze and dissect glucocorticoid- P31645 interactions on a molecular level that corresponds to in vivo animal models using C57BL/6N mice . Cortagine infused into the medial prefrontal cortex attenuates predator-induced defensive behaviors and Fos protein production in selective nuclei of the amygdala in male CD1 mice . P06850 ( CRF ) plays an essential role in coordinating the autonomic , endocrine and behavioral responses to stressors . In this study , we investigated the role of CRF within the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) in modulating unconditioned defensive behaviors , by examining the effects of microinfusing cortagine a selective type-1 CRF receptor ( CRF1 ) agonist , or acidic-astressin a preferential CRF1 antagonist , into the mPFC in male CD-1 mice exposed to a live predator ( rat exposure test -- P07949 ) . Cortagine microinfusions significantly reduced several indices of defense , including avoidance and freezing , suggesting a specific role for CRF1 within the infralimbic and prelimbic regions of the mPFC in modulating unconditioned behavioral responsivity to a predator . In contrast , microinfusions of acidic-astressin failed to alter defensive behaviors during predator exposure in the P07949 . Cortagine microinfusions also reduced Fos protein production in the medial , central and basomedial , but not basolateral subnuclei of the amygdala in mice exposed to the rat predatory threat stimulus . These results suggest that CRF1 activation within the mPFC attenuates predator-induced unconditioned anxiety-like defensive behaviors , likely via inhibition of specific amygdalar nuclei . Furthermore , the present findings suggest that the mPFC represents a unique neural region whereby activation of CRF1 produces behavioral effects that contrast with those elicited following systemic administration of CRF1 agonists . The C-type lectin Q99685 expressed by dendritic cells detects glycan changes on P15941 in colon carcinoma . The epithelial mucin P15941 is a high molecular weight membrane glycoprotein frequently overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated in adenocarcinoma . Mucins normally contain high amounts of O-linked carbohydrate structures that may influence immune reactions to this antigen . During malignant transformation , certain glyco-epitopes of P15941 , such as Tn-antigen , TF-antigen and their sialylated forms become exposed . The role of these glycan structures in tumor biology is unknown , but their presence is known to correlate with poor prognosis in several adenocarcinomas . We analyzed the potency of P15941 containing Tn-antigens ( P15941 -Tn ) to target C-type lectins that function as carbohydrate recognition and uptake molecules on dendritic cells ( DC ) . We identified the macrophage galactose type C-type lectin ( Q99685 ) , expressed by both DC and macrophages , as the receptor for recognition and binding of P15941 -Tn . To validate the occurrence of Q99685 - P15941 interactions in situ , we studied the binding of Q99685 to P15941 in primary colon carcinoma tissue . Isolation of P15941 out of colon carcinoma tissue showed strong binding activity to Q99685 . Interestingly , Q99685 binding to P15941 was highly correlated to binding by the lectin Helix pomatia agglutinin ( Q9Y251 ) , which is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer . The detection of Q99685 positive cells in situ at the tumor site together with the modified glycosylation status of P15941 to target Q99685 on DC suggests that Q99685 positive antigen presenting cells may play a role in tumor progression . Q9Y251 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in the progression of oral mucosal melanoma . Oral mucosal melanoma is an aggressive neoplasm with poor prognosis . Q9Y251 is an endo-beta-d-glucuronidase , which cleaves heparan sulphate chains . The vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) is the most potent angiogenic mitogen and interaction with its receptor ( VEGFR ) has been associated with angiogenesis . We investigated the expression of these molecules in the progression of oral mucosal melanoma . Immunohistochemistry was carried out in 15 oral melanotic macules and 19 oral melanomas using heparanase , P15692 , P35968 , P28906 and Ki-67 . Microvessel density was determined and subjected to statistical analysis . Q9Y251 and P35968 were not expressed in the oral melanotic macule . Atypical melanocytes and melanoma cells expressed heparanase , P15692 and P35968 . An intense expression was noted in the early invasive phase , which marks the crucial transition from in situ to the invasive phase . In the invasive component , heparanase was intense but selective in the invasive fronts and at the periphery of nests unlike the extensive expression of P15692 and P35968 . However , hot spots were only observed at the periphery of the nests . In conclusion , melanoma cells expressed heparanase , P15692 and P35968 . The coexpression of these molecules in atypical melanocytes and melanoma cells suggests their function in cell migration and invasion . Moreover , the intense expression in the crucial transition from in situ to the invasive phase suggests their role in the progression of the tumor . The role of P15692 and P35968 in angiogenesis was evident only at the periphery of the nests in the invasive components . DB08875 inhibits growth of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer and affects bone remodeling . DB08875 is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases , including MET and P35968 . In a phase II clinical trial in advanced prostate cancer ( PCa ) , cabozantinib treatment improved bone scans in 68 % of evaluable patients . Our studies aimed to determine the expression of cabozantinib targets during PCa progression and to evaluate its efficacy in hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa in preclinical models while delineating its effects on tumor and bone . Using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays containing normal prostate , primary PCa , and soft tissue and bone metastases , our data show that levels of MET , P-MET , and P35968 are increasing during PCa progression . Our data also show that the expression of cabozantinib targets are particularly pronounced in bone metastases . To evaluate cabozantinib efficacy on PCa growth in the bone environment and in soft tissues we used androgen-sensitive LuCaP 23.1 and castration-resistant C4-2B PCa tumors . In vivo , cabozantinib inhibited the growth of PCa in bone as well as growth of subcutaneous tumors . Furthermore , cabozantinib treatment attenuated the bone response to the tumor and resulted in increased normal bone volume . In summary , the expression pattern of cabozantinib targets in primary and castration-resistant metastatic PCa , and its efficacy in two different models of PCa suggest that this agent has a strong potential for the effective treatment of PCa at different stages of the disease . Small in-frame deletion in the epidermal growth factor receptor as a target for DB05294 . DB05294 is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( P35968 / P35968 ) tyrosine kinase , with additional activity against epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase . DB05294 inhibits angiogenesis and growth of a wide range of tumor models in vivo . Gefitinib ( " DB00317 " ) is a selective P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in cancer cell proliferation . Here , the ability of gefitinib and DB05294 to inhibit tumor cell proliferation was examined directly in eight cancer cell lines in vitro , and a strong correlation was noted between the IC(50) values of gefitinib and DB05294 ( r = 0.79 ) . No correlation was observed between the sensitivity to DB05294 and the level of P00533 or VEGFR expression . The NSCLC cell line PC-9 was seen to be hypersensitive to gefitinib and DB05294 , and a small ( 15-bp ) in-frame deletion of an DB00171 -binding site ( exon 19 ) in the P00533 was detected ( delE746-A750-type deletion ) . To clarify the involvement of the deletional mutation of P00533 in the cellular sensitivity to DB05294 , we examined the effect of this agent on HEK293 stable transfectants expressing deletional P00533 that designed as the same deletion site observed in PC-9 cells ( 293-pDelta15 ) . These cells exhibited a 60-fold higher sensitivity to DB05294 compared with transfectants expressing wild-type P00533 . DB05294 inhibited the phosphorylation of the mutant P00533 by 10-fold compared with cells with wild-type P00533 . In conclusion , the findings suggested that a small in-frame deletion in the P00533 increased the cellular sensitivity to DB05294 . Feasibility of using molecular docking-based virtual screening for searching dual target kinase inhibitors . Multitarget agents have been extensively explored for solving limited efficacies , poor safety , and resistant profiles of an individual target . Theoretical approaches for searching and designing multitarget agents are critically useful . Here , the performance of molecular docking to search dual-target inhibitors for four kinase pairs ( P24941 - P49841 , P00533 -Src , Lck-Src , and Lck- P35968 ) was assessed . First , the representative structures for each kinase target were chosen by structural clustering of available crystal structures . Next , the performance of molecular docking to distinguish inhibitors from noninhibitors for each individual kinase target was evaluated . The results show that molecular docking-based virtual screening illustrates good capability to find known inhibitors for individual targets , but the prediction accuracy is structurally dependent . Finally , the performance of molecular docking to identify the dual-target kinase inhibitors for four kinase pairs was evaluated . The analyses show that molecular docking successfully filters out most noninhibitors and achieves promising performance for identifying dual-kinase inhibitors for P24941 - P49841 and Lck- P35968 . But a high false-positive rate leads to low enrichment of true dual-target inhibitors in the final list . This study suggests that molecular docking serves as a useful tool in searching inhibitors against dual or even multiple kinase targets , but integration with other virtual screening tools is necessary for achieving better predictions . P00797 inhibition with aliskiren . 1. Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties . Molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have led to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors , such as aliskiren . 2 . DB09026 has a low bioavailability ( between 2.6 and 5.0 % ) compensated by its high potency to inhibit renin ( IC50 : 0.6 nmol/L ) and a long plasma half-life ( 23-36 h ) , which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing . 3 . The once-daily administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers BP as strongly as standard doses of established angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1 ) receptor blockers ( losartan , valsartan , irbesartan ) , hydrochlorothiazide , angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( ramipril and lisinopril ) or long acting calcium channel blockers ( amlodipine ) . In combination therapy , aliskiren further decreases blood pressure when combined with either hydrochlorothiazide , amlodipine , irbesartan or ramipril . 4 . The biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those of angiotensin I-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibition and Ang II antagonism , particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the bradykinin-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway and possibly the (pro)renin receptor . 5 . Blockade of the renin angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) with P12821 inhibitors , AT1 receptor blockers or a combination of these drugs has become one of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine . However , it remains unclear how to optimize DB01367 blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal benefits . In this context , renin inhibition to render the DB01367 fully quiescent is a new possibility requiring further study . Synaptic and photoreceptor components in retinal pigment epithelial cell transplanted retinas of Royal College of Surgeons dystrophic rats . Plexiform layer synaptic and photoreceptor cell components were investigated in retinas of Royal College of Surgeons ( RCS ) dystrophic rats transplanted with normal retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells by immunocytochemistry using previously characterized monoclonal antibodies . In retinas of normal adult rats and Q96AT9 -cell transplanted retinas of 4 month-old RCS rats , HNK-1 , a marker for a carbohydrate of the neural cell adhesion molecule ( N- P62158 ) , was detected immunocytochemically in the inner and outer plexiform layers and ganglion cell bodies and their axons . HNK-1 was also detected in the inner plexiform layer of nontreated retinas of 4 month-old RCS rats , but was reduced to scattered patches in the outer plexiform layer . In addition , immunoreactivity for the SVP-38 antibody recognizing synaptophysin was found in both plexiform layers of normal adult rat retinas and Q96AT9 -transplanted retinas of 4 month-old RCS rats . Furthermore , photoreceptor cell bodies and their inner and outer segments were immunostained for the opsin monoclonal antibody P07949 -P1 in retinas of normal adult rats and Q96AT9 -cell transplanted retinas of 4 month-old RCS rats . However , in nontreated retinas of 4-month-old RCS rats , only immunostained debris material was detected . These results strongly suggest that normal Q96AT9 transplants not only rescue photoreceptor cells in RCS rats , but also maintain an essential functional capacity , in this case , synaptic components in the plexiform layers . DB08875 overcomes crizotinib resistance in P08922 fusion-positive cancer . PURPOSE : P08922 rearrangement leads to constitutive P08922 activation with potent transforming activity . In an ongoing phase I trial , the Q9UM73 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) crizotinib shows remarkable initial responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harboring P08922 fusions ; however , cancers eventually develop crizotinib resistance due to acquired mutations such as G2032R in P08922 . Thus , understanding the crizotinib-resistance mechanisms in P08922 -rearranged NSCLC and identification of therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance are required . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The sensitivity of P04233 - P08922 -transformed Ba/ P13726 cells to multiple Q9UM73 inhibitors was examined . Acquired P08922 inhibitor-resistant mutations in P04233 - P08922 fusion were screened by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis with Ba/ P13726 cells . To overcome the resistance mutation , we performed high-throughput drug screening with small-molecular inhibitors and anticancer drugs used in clinical practice or being currently tested in clinical trials . The effect of the identified drug was assessed in the P04233 - P08922 -mutant Ba/ P13726 cells and crizotinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cells ( MGH047 ) harboring G2032R-mutated P04233 - P08922 . RESULTS : We identified multiple novel crizotinib-resistance mutations in the P08922 kinase domain , including the G2032R mutation . As the result of high-throughput drug screening , we found that the cMET/ P07949 /VEGFR inhibitor cabozantinib ( DB05153 ) effectively inhibited the survival of P04233 - P08922 wild-type ( WT ) and resistant mutants harboring Ba/ P13726 and MGH047 cells . Furthermore , cabozantinib could overcome all the resistance by all newly identified secondary mutations . CONCLUSIONS : We developed a comprehensive model of acquired resistance to P08922 inhibitors in NSCLC with P08922 rearrangement and identified cabozantinib as a therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance . Implantation of P15692 transfected preadipocytes improves vascularization of fibrin implants on the cylinder chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) model . The successful substitution or augmentation of soft tissues by implantation of three dimensional cell constructs , consisting of human preadipocytes and fibrin glue as a carrier matrix , requires a rapid and homogeneous vascularization of the whole implant in order to provide a sufficient blood supply of centrally situated cells . Previous investigations have shown that under in vivo conditions primary human preadipocytes induce vascularization of fibrin matrices by secretion of several growth factors , such as P15692 and P09038 . The current study investigates whether vascularization of implants can be improved by transplantation of preadipocytes following transfection with a P15692 -vector . Transfection was performed by electroporation with an pCMX-GFP and pCMX-VEGF165 vector . Transfection efficiency ( GFP expression ) and P15692 expression were determined in vitro by FACS analysis and P15692 immunoassay , respectively . In vivo investigations to determine the vascularization of the implants were performed on the cylinder chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) . Four million P15692 transfected cells were transferred within a fibrin matrix onto the P62158 on the 7(th) day of incubation and after 8 days the vascularization of the implant was histologically examined and evaluated by means of a computer-assisted image analysis program . Transfection of preadipocytes with the GFP vector by electroporation yielded transfection efficiencies between 12 % and 41 % of surviving cells . Results of the P15692 immunoassay demonstrated that P15692 expression was significantly higher following transfection . Investigations on the P62158 outlined a significantly higher rate of vascularization in the transfected vs. control population . Our investigations demonstrate that primary human preadipocytes can be successfully transfected by electroporation with a P15692 vector . The enhanced P15692 expression on transfected cells results in an increase of vascularization of the cell constructs on the P62158 . Novel withanolides target medullary thyroid cancer through inhibition of both P07949 phosphorylation and the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway . BACKGROUND : Despite development of current targeted therapies for medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) , long-term survival remains unchanged . Recently isolated novel withanolide compounds from Solanaceae physalis are highly potent against MTCs . We hypothesize that these withanolides uniquely inhibit P07949 phosphorylation and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway in P04629 cells as a mechanism of antiproliferation and apoptosis . METHODS : P04629 cells were treated with novel withanolides and P04629 -targeted drugs . In vitro studies assessed cell viability and proliferation ( MTS ; trypan blue assays ) , apoptosis ( flow cytometry with P08758 /PI staining ; confirmed by Western blot analysis ) , long-term cytotoxic effects ( clonogenic assay ) , and suppression of key regulatory proteins such as P07949 , Akt , and P42345 ( by Western blot analysis ) . RESULTS : The novel withanolides potently reduced P04629 cell viability ( half maximal inhibitory concentration [ IC(50) ] , 270-2,850 nmol/L ; 250-1,380 nmol/L for vandetanib ; 360-1,640 nmol/L for cabozantinib ) with induction of apoptosis at < 1,000 nmol/L of drug . Unique from other targeted therapies , withanolides suppressed P07949 and Akt phosphorylation and protein expression ( in a concentration- and time-dependent manner ) as well as P42345 activity and translational activity of Q13541 and protein synthesis mediated by p70S6kinase activation at IC(50) concentrations . CONCLUSION : Novel withanolides from Physalis selectively and potently inhibit P04629 cells in vitro . Unlike other P04629 -targeted therapies , these compounds uniquely inhibit both P07949 kinase activity and the Akt/ P42345 prosurvival pathway . Further translational studies are warranted to evaluate their clinical potential . P10145 and P14902 expression by human gingival fibroblasts via TLRs . Human gingival fibroblasts ( HGFs ) , a predominant cell type in tooth-supporting structure , are presently recognized for their active role in the innate immune response . They produce a variety of inflammatory cytokines in response to microbial components such as LPS from the key periodontal pathogen , Porphyromonas gingivalis . In this study , we demonstrated that HGFs expressed mRNA of TLRs 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 9 , but not TLRs 7 , 8 , and 10 . Stimulation of HGFs with highly purified O60603 ligand ( P. gingivalis LPS ) , O15455 ligand ( poly(I:C) ) , O00206 ligand ( Escherichia coli LPS ) , and O60602 ligand ( Salmonella typhimurium flagellin ) led to expression of P10145 and P14902 . A potent TLR 9 ligand , CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 had no effect , although HGFs showed a detectable Q9NR96 mRNA expression . No significant enhancement on P10145 or P14902 expression was observed when HGFs were stimulated with various combinations of TLR ligands . Surprisingly , the Q9NR96 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 was able to specifically inhibit poly(I:C)-induced P10145 and P14902 expression . P01375 enhanced TLR ligand-induced P10145 production in HGFs , whereas P01579 enhanced TLR ligand-induced P14902 expression . P14210 production of P14902 in response to P. gingivalis LPS , P01579 , or the two in combination inhibited T cell proliferation in MLRs . The observed T cell inhibition could be reversed by addition of either 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan or l-tryptophan . Our results suggest an important role of HGFs not only in orchestrating the innate immune response , but also in dampening potentially harmful hyperactive inflammation in periodontal tissue . [ Serotonin transporter gene and stress reactivity in unipolar depression. Role of the Q9Y251 system as endophenotype of the P31645 gene ] . BACKGROUND : A length polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene ( 5-HTTLPR ) is associated with both depression and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) system activity . A dysregulation of the Q9Y251 system is considered to be a candidate endophenotype of depression . The objective of the present study was an investigation of a possible gene-endophenotype-interaction between 5-HTTLPR and Q9Y251 system activity in a sample of inpatients with major depression . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 237 inpatients with major depression were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and participated in a combined dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone test ( DB00514 - P06850 test ) as well as using the Hamilton score ( Hamilton rating scale for depression ) to determine the severity of the psychopathology . RESULTS : Patients with the ss-genotype showed a significantly higher Q9Y251 -system activity in comparison to patients with the lI-genotype , but no association between 5-HTTLPR and the severity of psychopathology could be detected . CONCLUSIONS : The results of the current study demonstrate an influence of 5-HTTLPR on dysregulation of the Q9Y251 system in patients with major depression and support the hypothesis that 5-HTTLPR- and Q9Y251 -system-interaction constitutes an important component in the pathogenesis of depression . Q9Y251 -mediated loss of nuclear syndecan-1 enhances histone acetyltransferase ( O60235 ) activity to promote expression of genes that drive an aggressive tumor phenotype . Q9Y251 acts as a master regulator of the aggressive tumor phenotype in part by enhancing expression of proteins known to drive tumor progression ( e.g. P15692 , P14780 , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) , and O14788 ) . However , the mechanism whereby this enzyme regulates gene expression remains unknown . We previously reported that elevation of heparanase levels in myeloma cells causes a dramatic reduction in the amount of syndecan-1 in the nucleus . Because syndecan-1 has heparan sulfate chains and because exogenous heparan sulfate has been shown to inhibit the activity of histone acetyltransferase ( O60235 ) enzymes in vitro , we hypothesized that the reduction in nuclear syndecan-1 in cells expressing high levels of heparanase would result in increased O60235 activity leading to stimulation of protein transcription . We found that myeloma cells or tumors expressing high levels of heparanase and low levels of nuclear syndecan-1 had significantly higher levels of O60235 activity when compared with cells or tumors expressing low levels of heparanase . High levels of O60235 activity in heparanase-high cells were blocked by SST0001 , an inhibitor of heparanase . Restoration of high syndecan-1 levels in heparanase-high cells diminished nuclear O60235 activity , establishing syndecan-1 as a potent inhibitor of O60235 . Exposure of heparanase-high cells to anacardic acid , an inhibitor of O60235 activity , significantly suppressed their expression of P15692 and P14780 , two genes known to be up-regulated following elevation of heparanase . These results reveal a novel mechanistic pathway driven by heparanase expression , which leads to decreased nuclear syndecan-1 , increased O60235 activity , and up-regulation of transcription of multiple genes that drive an aggressive tumor phenotype . P10275 expression in C-cells and in medullary thyroid carcinoma . Recent studies have shown a higher incidence of C-cell hyperplasia ( CCH ) in men compared with women in postmortem thyroid tissues . We postulated that the expression of androgen receptor ( AR ) protein may , in part , explain the differences . To test this hypothesis , we examined thyroid tissue from 27 consecutive autopsy cases for the presence of CCH ( defined as > 50 C-cells/x100 magnification in three fields ) and for AR expression in autopsy cases and in 43 medullary thyroid carcinomas ( MTCs ) from patients with sporadic and familial disease as well as two multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A patients with only CCH . CCH was present in 8 of 20 males ( 40 % ) and in 1 of 7 females ( 14 % ) at autopsy . AR protein was detected in most surgically resected thyroids with P04629 and CCH ( 80 % ) , but in only 25 % of autopsy thyroids , probably reflecting postmortem degradation of the receptor protein . Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of AR mRNA in P04629 and in papillary thyroid carcinomas . These results support the observation that CCH is more common in postmortem thyroids of males and suggest that the presence of AR with higher circulating levels of androgens may contribute to the higher incidence of CCH in men . DB08875 : a review of its use in patients with medullary thyroid cancer . DB08875 ( Cometriq(®) ) is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors , including those involved in the pathogenesis of medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) [ i.e. rearranged during transfection ( P07949 ) , MET and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) -2 ] . DB08875 is indicated for the treatment of adults with progressive , unresectable locally advanced ( in the EU ) or metastatic ( in the EU and USA ) P04629 . Compared with placebo , cabozantinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival , reflecting a 72 % reduction in the risk of disease progression or death , in patients with unresectable , locally advanced or metastatic P04629 participating in a multinational , phase III study . A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving cabozantinib than those receiving placebo achieved an objective response or disease stabilization ( i.e. a complete or partial response , or stable disease ) . The overall survival benefit with cabozantinib is as yet unclear , with no significant benefit observed in two interim analyses ( one prespecified , and one unplanned and conducted at the request of the US FDA ) . The tolerability profile of oral cabozantinib is typical for a small molecule targeting the VEGFR and other tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways , with adverse events associated with the inhibition of the P15692 pathway ( e.g. gastrointestinal perforation , haemorrhage , hypertension and venous thrombosis ) reported in the phase III study . Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally managed with supportive therapy , dose reductions and/or dose interruptions . Although final overall survival data are awaited , current evidence suggests cabozantinib to be a valuable treatment option for adults with progressive , unresectable locally advanced or metastatic P04629 . Adjuvant effects of formalin-inactivated HSV through activation of dendritic cells and inactivation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer immunotherapy . Use of adequate adjuvant is necessary for induction of effective antitumor immune responses . To develop an effective adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy , we selected formalin-inactivated (f)-HSV as an adjuvant component , and analyzed the mechanisms underlying its adjuvant effects . First , we found that f-HSV can induce the tumor antigen-specific CTLs by enhancing antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells ( DCs ) , mainly through O60603 , but not Q9NR96 . Next , f-HSV was also found to prevent the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) . We demonstrated that the expansion of MDSCs in the blood and spleen during tumor progression required B cells producing the inflammatory angiogenesis factors , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -A and neuropilin-1 ( NRP-1 ) , a co-receptor for P15692 receptor-2 ( P35968 ) . Interestingly , the transmembrane-type NRP-1 on B cells changed to soluble-type NRP-1 ( sNRP-1 ) by f-HSV treatment . We further showed that the sNRP-1 and P15692 secreted from B cells by f-HSV treatment could abrogate the immunosuppressive ability of MDSCs . These results suggest that f-HSV can enhance antitumor immune responses as an adjuvant , not only through activation of DCs , but also inactivation of MDSCs via B cells . No significant association between genetic variants in 7 candidate genes and response to methylphenidate treatment in adult patients with ADHD . Results from pharmacogenetic investigations of methylphenidate ( DB00422 ) response in patients with ADHD are still inconsistent , especially among adults . This study investigates the role of genetic variants ( P31645 , P28222 , Q8IWU9 , P09172 , P21917 , P21964 , and P60880 ) in the response to DB00422 in a sample of 164 adults . Genes were chosen owing to previous evidence for an influence in ADHD susceptibility . No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between DB00422 responders and nonresponders were detected . In conclusion , our findings do not support an effect of these genes in the pharmacogenetics of DB00422 among adults with ADHD .
Aripiprazole : a novel atypical antipsychotic drug with a uniquely robust pharmacology . Aripiprazole ( DB01238 ) is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been recently introduced for clinical use in the treatment of schizophrenia . Aripiprazole has a unique pharmacologic profile that includes partial agonism at several G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) [ especially dopamine ( D2 ) and P08908 ] and antagonistic action at others ( especially 5- Q13049 ) . Clinical trials indicate that aripiprazole is effective in treating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . In short-term studies rapid onset of action ( within one week ) has been demonstrated . Preliminary data indicate that aripiprazole may also be effective in the treatment of manic symptoms of bipolar disorder . At recommended doses , aripiprazole appears to be safe and well tolerated in most adult patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder . There is only limited information available on the use of aripiprazole in children and adolescents , and pilot data suggest that a revised dosing strategy , based on weight , is indicated in this population . In the long-term studies , the use of aripiprazole was associated with continued efficacy , good compliance and increased time-to-relapse . Aripiprazole represents the first functionally selective atypical antipsychotic drug . Gene expression and molecular changes in cerebral arteries following subarachnoid hemorrhage in the rat . OBJECT : The authors investigated early changes in the cerebral arteries of rats that occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage ( Q53FZ2 ) . METHODS : Messenger RNA was investigated by performing microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analyses , and protein expression was shown by performing immunohistochemical studies . The array data indicated that the initial processes that occur after Q53FZ2 involve activation of genes involved in angiogenesis , inflammation , and extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) remodeling . The real-time PCR investigation confirmed upregulation of genes that were observed using the microarray to be regulated , including P35228 , P45452 , and cxcl2 . The authors also verified the upregulation of previously implicated genes for G-protein-coupled receptors ( endothelin B [ ETB ] , angiotensin 1 [ AT1 ] , and P50052 ) and metalloproteinase 9 . The results of an immunohistochemical study confirmed that receptor genes that were seen to be regulated produced an increase in protein expression . Double immunostaining of rat cerebral arteries with endothelial cell- or smooth-muscle cell-specific antibodies verified that an increase in ETB , 5-hydrotryptamine ( P28222 ) , and P28221 receptor expression occurs in smooth-muscle cells . CONCLUSIONS : Processes occurring after Q53FZ2 lead to enhanced arterial contractility and Q13201 remodeling either directly or through angiogenesis and inflammation . These processes are active via an increase in metalloproteinase expression , the presence of proangiogenic factors , and the expression of proinflammatory genes . Role of presynaptic serotonergic receptors on the mechanism of action of P08908 and P28222 agonists on masculine sexual behaviour : physiological and pharmacological implications . In order to establish whether the P08908 or the 5HT1B agonists , 8-OH-DPAT or TFMPP , produce their facilitatory or inhibitory actions on masculine sexual behaviour via a mechanism involving : ( a ) the serotonin synthesis or release ; ( b ) the stimulation of presynaptic receptors , or ( c ) the stimulation of somatodendritic receptors , three series of experiments were performed . The administration of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor , p-chlorophenylalanine ( p- P15085 , 300 mg/kg x 3 days ) , facilitated sexual behaviour but does not interfere neither with the inhibitory nor with the facilitatory effects of TFMPP ( 0.5 mg/kg ) or 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.5 mg/kg ) , respectively . The icv or the intraraphé administration of the serotonergic neurotoxin , 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine ( 5,7- DB02901 ) , slightly stimulated masculine sexual behaviour and produced a decrease in serotonin and its metabolite levels . In lesioned animals TFMPP ( 0.5 mg/kg ) resulted in an inhibitory effect reflected as a prolongation of the ejaculation latency . The inhibitory effect of this drug on mounting behaviour was not observed in 5,7- DB02901 treated rats . In lesioned animals 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.5 mg/kg ) produced the same facilitatory effect . Present data indicate that serotonergic postsynaptic receptors mediate both the inhibitory and the facilitatory actions of TFMPP or 8-OH-DPAT in copulation . All data further support the idea that endogenous serotonin acts via the stimulation of P28222 receptors to induce its inhibitory effects on masculine sexual behaviour . P01308 and adiponectin inhibit the TNFalpha-induced DB01686 accumulation in human endothelial cells : the role of DDAH . OBJECTIVE : P01308 and adiponectin exert important effects on the vasculature . We wanted to explore whether the P29474 inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine ( DB01686 ) contribute to their effects . METHODS : Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) and human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAECs ) were incubated with growth medium in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) , D-glucose , insulin or adiponectin . Further , cells exposed to TNFalpha for 24h were co-stimulated with insulin or adiponectin for additional 24h . Concentrations of DB01686 in conditioned media and activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase ( DDAH ) in cell lysates were determined . RESULTS : The dose-dependent TNFalpha-induced DB01686 accumulation was significantly inhibited when co-stimulated with insulin or adiponectin in both cell lines ( p < 0.01 for all ) , accompanied by significant increases in DDAH activity in all conditions . P01308 alone resulted in a significant , but inversely dose-dependent accumulation of DB01686 as compared to control cells in both cell lines , accompanied by increased DDAH activity . Q15848 alone tended , dose-dependently to decrease DB01686 , but without an increase of DDAH activity . CONCLUSION : The results indicate that DB01686 accumulation in human cultured endothelial cells is influenced by both insulin and adiponectin , and both mediators counteract the TNFalpha-induced accumulation of DB01686 through the DDAH pathway . DB08895 in kidney transplantation . INTRODUCTION : This review will discuss the mechanism of action and important kidney transplant clinical trial data for the small molecule Janus kinase ( JAK ) 3 inhibitor tofacitinib , formerly known as CP-690,550 and tasocitinib . AREAS COVERED : Successful kidney transplantation requires adequate immunosuppression . Current maintenance immunosuppressive protocols which rely on calcineurin inhibitors have long-term nephrotoxicity and negative impact on cardiometabolic risk factors . JAKs are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that participate in the signaling of a broad range of cell surface receptors , particularly members of the cytokine receptor common gamma ( cγ ) chain family . P52333 inhibition has immunosuppressive effects and treatment with tofacitinib in clinical trials has demonstrated efficacy in autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis . Nonhuman primate models of renal transplantation demonstrated prolonged graft survival with tofacitinib compared to control . Renal transplant clinical trials in humans have demonstrated tofacitinib to be noninferior to cyclosporine in terms of rejection rates and graft survival . There was also a lower rate of new onset diabetes after transplant . However , there was a trend toward more infections , including cytomegalovirus and BK virus nephritis . EXPERT OPINION : DB08895 may be a promising alternative to calcineurin inhibitors . The optimal therapeutic window is still being determined . DB00171 -sensitive potassium channel activation induces angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo . Intense research is conducted to identify new molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis . Previous studies have shown that the angiogenic effects of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) depend on the activation of DB00171 -sensitive potassium channels ( KATP ) and that P23582 ( P09543 ) , which can act through KATP , promotes endothelial cell growth . We therefore investigated whether direct KATP activation induces angiogenic responses and whether it is required for the endothelial responses to P09543 or vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . Chick chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) angiogenesis was similarly enhanced by the direct KATP channel activator 2-nicotinamidoethyl acetate ( SG-209 ) and by P09543 or P15692 . The KATP inhibitors glibenclamide and 5-hydroxydecanoate ( 5-HD ) reduced basal and abolished P09543 -induced P62158 angiogenesis . In vitro , the direct KATP openers nicorandil and SG-209 and the polypeptides P15692 and P09543 increased proliferation and migration in bEnd.3 mouse endothelial cells . In addition , P15692 and P09543 induced cord-like formation on Matrigel by human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . All these in vitro endothelial responses were effectively abrogated by glibenclamide or 5-HD . In HUVECs , a small-interfering RNA-mediated decrease in the expression of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel ( Kir ) 6.1 subunit impaired cell migration and network morphogenesis in response to either SG-209 or P09543 . We conclude that 1 ) direct pharmacologic activation of KATP induces angiogenic effects in vitro and in vivo , 2 ) angiogenic responses to P09543 and P15692 depend on KATP activation and require the expression of the Kir6.1 KATP subunit , and 3 ) KATP activation may underpin angiogenesis to a variety of vasoactive stimuli , including H2S , P15692 , and P09543 . Differential regulation of membrane guanylyl cyclases in congestive heart failure : natriuretic peptide receptor ( NPR ) -B , Not P16066 , is the predominant natriuretic peptide receptor in the failing heart . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) and B-type natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) bind natriuretic peptide receptor ( NPR ) -A and decrease blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy by elevating cGMP concentrations . Physiological responses to P01160 and DB04899 are diminished in congestive heart failure ( CHF ) by an unknown mechanism . P23582 ( P09543 ) binding to P20594 decreases cardiac hypertrophy , but the effect of CHF on P20594 is unknown . Here , we measured P01160 / P16066 -dependent and P09543 / P20594 -dependent guanylyl cyclase activities in membranes from failing and nonfailing hearts . Transaortic banding of mice resulted in marked CHF as indicated by increased heart/body weight ratios , increased left ventricular diameters , and decreased ejection fractions . In nonfailed hearts , saturating P01160 concentrations increased particulate guanylyl cyclase activity almost 10-fold , whereas saturating P09543 concentrations increased activity 6.9-fold , or to about 70 % of the P01160 response . In contrast , in failed heart preparations , P09543 elicited twice as much activity as P01160 due to dramatic reductions in P16066 activity without changes in P20594 activity . For the first time , these data indicate that P20594 activity represents a significant and previously unappreciated portion of the natriuretic peptide-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity in the normal heart and that P20594 accounts for the majority of the natriuretic peptide-dependent activity in the failed heart . Based on these findings , we suggest that drugs that target both NPRs may be more beneficial than drugs like nesiritide ( Natrecor ) that target P16066 alone . Angiotensin II regulates vascular and endothelial dysfunction : recent topics of P30556 signaling in the vasculature . Accumulating evidence strongly implicates angiotensin II ( AngII ) intracellular signaling in mediating cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension , atherosclerosis and restenosis after vascular injury . In vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) , through its G-protein-coupled AngII Type 1 receptor ( AT(1) ) , AngII activates various intracellular protein kinases , such as receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases , which includes epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) , c-Src , Q14289 , Q05397 , O60674 . In addition , AngII activates serine/threonine kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) family , P08133 S6 kinase , Akt/protein kinase B and various protein kinase C isoforms . In VSMCs , AngII also induces the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which play critical roles in activation and modulation of above signal transduction . Less is known about endothelial cell ( EC ) AngII signaling than VSMCs , however , recent studies suggest that endothelial AngII signaling negatively regulates the nitric oxide ( NO ) signaling pathway and thereby induces endothelial dysfunction . Moreover , in both VSMCs and ECs , AngII signaling cross-talk with insulin signaling might be involved in insulin resistance , an important risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases . In fact , clinical and pharmacological studies showed that AngII infusion induces insulin resistance and AngII converting enzyme inhibitors and AT(1) receptor blockers improve insulin sensitivity . In this review , we focus on the recent findings that suggest the existence of novel signaling mechanisms whereby AngII mediates processes , such as activation of receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases and ROS , as well as cross-talk between insulin and NO signal transduction in VSMCs and ECs . Agonist selectivity for three species of natriuretic peptide receptor-A . We determined the nucleotide sequence of mouse natriuretic peptide receptor-A ( P16066 ) cDNA and compared the revised deduced amino acid sequence with those of rat and human P16066 . The ligand selectivity of these three receptor/guanylyl cyclases was examined by whole-cell stimulation of cGMP production . The 28-amino acid atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) has only one difference among these three species , i.e. , human DB00134 -12 versus rat and mouse DB00167 -12 . However , despite the nearly invariant P01160 sequence among these species , P01160 analogs have marked differences in ED50 values and maximal cGMP responses among the three receptors . With the natriuretic peptide analogs we tested , human P16066 is less sensitive than rat or mouse P16066 to changes in the 17-amino acid , disulfide-bonded ring of P01160 and to the species differences in brain natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) but is more sensitive to deletions in the carboxyl tail of P01160 . The P01160 determinants of agonist potency have therefore changed for different species of P16066 . This is reflected in the amino acid sequence divergence in the receptor extracellular domains and in the divergence and specificity of DB04899 among species . Our results suggest that the coevolution of P16066 and DB04899 has thus been constrained within the context of the conserved P01160 sequence . O14965 regulates O60674 - P40763 activity in human gastric and esophageal cancers . O14965 is a frequently amplified and overexpressed gene in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas ( UGCs ) . Using in vitro cell models of UGCs , we investigated whether O14965 can regulate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( P40763 ) . Our data indicate that overexpression of O14965 in FLO-1 and AGS cells increase P40763 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 site , whereas O14965 genetic depletion by siRNA results in decreased phosphorylation levels of P40763 in FLO-1 and MKN45 cells . Immunofluorescence analysis showed that O14965 overexpression enhanced P40763 nuclear translocation while O14965 genetic knockdown reduced the nuclear translocation of P40763 in AGS and FLO-1 cells , respectively . Using a luciferase reporter assay , we demonstrated that O14965 expression induces transcriptional activity of P40763 . Pharmacological inhibition of O14965 by DB05220 reduced P40763 phosphorylation along with down-regulation of P40763 pro-survival targets , P10415 and Q07820 . Moreover , by using clonogenic cells survival assay , we showed that DB05220 single dose treatment reduced the ability of FLO-1 and AGS cells to form colonies . Additional experiments utilizing cell models of overexpression and knockdown of O14965 indicated that P40763 upstream non-receptor tyrosine kinase O60674 ( O60674 ) is mediating the effect of O14965 on P40763 . The inhibition of O60674 using O60674 -specific inhibitor AZD1480 or siRNA knockdown , in presence of O14965 overexpression , abrogated the O14965 -mediated P40763 activation . These results confirm that the O14965 - O60674 axis is the main mechanism by which O14965 regulates P40763 activity . In conclusion , we report , for the first time , that O14965 promotes P40763 activity through regulating the expression and phosphorylation levels of O60674 . This highlights the importance of targeting O14965 as a therapeutic approach to treat gastric and esophageal cancers . Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . DB08895 is the first in a new class of nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) , a targeted , synthetic DMARD , approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARD . DB08895 , an orally administered Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor , decreases T-cell activation , pro-inflammatory cytokine production , and cytokine signaling by inhibiting binding of type I cytokine receptors family and γ-chain cytokines to paired P23458 / P52333 receptors . The net effect of tofacitinb 's mechanism of action is decreased synovial inflammation and structural joint damage in RA patients . To date , six phase 3 trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib under the oral rheumatoid arthritis triaLs ( ORAL ) series . This review describes the pharmacology of the novel agent , tofacitinib , and details the safety and efficacy data of the ORAL trials . Prevention of thrombus formation and growth by antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II-dependent thrombin inhibitors : importance of heparin cofactor II . DB01109 ( HEP ) prevents thrombus formation ( TF ) and thrombus growth ( TG ) , by accelerating thrombin ( THR ) inhibition by antithrombin III ( P01008 ) . Recent studies suggest that dermatan sulphate which catalyzes thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II ( HCII ) , can inhibit TF and TG as effectively as HEP . This study compared the antithrombotic effects of HEP and another agent , DB06271 ( SLX ) which catalyzes thrombin inhibition by P01008 and HCII simultaneously . TF was induced in rabbit jugular veins , using the stasis/hypercoagulation model . TG was measured as the accretion of 125I-fibrin onto existing thrombi in rabbit jugular veins . HEP and SLX inhibited TF when given in doses of 10 and 5 anti-thrombin U/kg , respectively . SLX ( 16 anti-thrombin U/kg or 260 micrograms/kg ) was more effective than HEP ( 120 anti-thrombin U/kg or 800 micrograms/kg ) in preventing TG when administered either as a bolus or by continuous infusion . These data suggest that agents which accelerate THR inhibition by both P01008 and HCII simultaneously , can inhibit TF and TG with less systemic anticoagulation than comparable antithrombotic doses of HEP . Combination therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma : additive preclinical efficacy of the HDAC inhibitor DB06603 with sorafenib . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a heterogeneous cancer in which sorafenib is the only approved systemic therapy . Histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) are commonly dysregulated in cancer and therefore represent promising targets for therapies , however their role in HCC pathogenesis is still unknown . We analyzed the expression of 11 HDACs in human HCCs and assessed the efficacy of the pan-HDAC inhibitor DB06603 alone and in combination with sorafenib in preclinical models of liver cancer . METHODS : Gene expression and copy number changes were analyzed in a cohort of 334 human HCCs , while the effects of DB06603 and sorafenib were evaluated in three liver cancer cell lines and a murine xenograft model . RESULTS : Aberrant HDAC expression was identified and validated in 91 and 243 HCCs , respectively . Upregulation of O15379 and Q9UQL6 mRNAs was significantly correlated with DNA copy number gains . Inhibiting HDACs with DB06603 led to strong anti-tumoral effects in vitro and vivo , enhanced by the addition of sorafenib . Cell viability and proliferation declined , while apoptosis and autophagy increased . DB06603 increased histone H3 and HSP90 acetylation , downregulated O15392 ( survivin ) and upregulated CDH1 . Combination therapy with DB06603 and sorafenib significantly decreased vessel density , and most significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival in HCC xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : Aberrant expression of several HDACs and copy number gains of O15379 and Q9UQL6 occur in HCC . Treatment with DB06603 combined with sorafenib demonstrated the highest preclinical efficacy in HCC models , providing the rationale for clinical studies with this novel combination . P11362 - 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A heteroreceptor complexes and their enhancement of hippocampal plasticity . BACKGROUND : The hippocampus and its 5-hydroxytryptamine transmission plays an important role in depression related to its involvement in limbic circuit plasticity . METHODS : The analysis was made with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer , co-immunoprecipitation , in situ proximity ligation assay , binding assay , in cell western and the forced swim test . RESULTS : Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analysis , fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ( P11362 ) -5-hydroxytryptamine 1A ( P08908 ) receptor complexes have been demonstrated and their specificity and agonist modulation characterized . Their presence based on co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay has also been indicated in hippocampal cultures and rat dorsal hippocampal formation showing a neuronal location . In vitro assays on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation have shown synergistic increases in signaling on coactivation with fibroblast growth factor 2 ( P09038 ) and a P08908 agonist , and dependent on the heteroreceptor interface . In vitro and in vivo studies also revealed a P08908 agonist induced phosphorylation of P11362 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in rat hippocampus without changing P09038 levels . Co-activation of the heteroreceptor also resulted in synergistic increases in extensions of PC12 cells and neurite densities and protrusions in primary hippocampal cultures dependent on the receptor interface . The combined acute and repeated intracerebroventricular treatment with P09038 and 8-OH-DPAT was found to produce evidence of highly significant antidepressant actions in the forced swim test . CONCLUSIONS : The findings indicate that neurotrophic and antidepressant effects of 5-HT in brain may , in part , be mediated by activation of the P08908 receptor protomer in the hippocampal P11362 - P08908 receptor complex enhancing the P11362 signaling . Risk variants in the P04271 gene predict elevated P04271 serum concentrations in healthy individuals . Several lines of evidence suggest an important role of the P04271 protein and its coding gene in different neuropathological and psychiatric disorders like dementia , bipolar affective disorders and schizophrenia . To clarify whether a direct link exists between gene and gene product , that is , whether P04271 variants directly modulate P04271 serum concentration , 196 healthy individuals were assessed for P04271 serum concentrations and genotyped for five potentially functional P04271 SNPs . Functional variants of the serotonergic genes P08908 and 5-HTT possibly modulating P04271 serum levels were also studied . Further , publicly available human postmortem gene expression data were re-analyzed to elucidate the impact of P04271 , P08908 and 5-HTT SNPs on frontal cortex P04271 mRNA expression . Several P04271 SNPs , particularly rs9722 , and the P04271 haplotype T-G-G-A ( including rs2186358-rs11542311-rs2300403-rs9722 ) were associated with elevated P04271 serum concentrations ( Bonferroni corrected P < 0.05 ) . Of these , rs11542311 was also associated with P04271 mRNA expression directly ( Bonferroni corrected P = 0.05 ) and within haplotype G-A-T-C ( rs11542311-rs2839356-rs9984765-rs881827 ; P = 0.004 ) , again with the G-allele increasing P04271 expression . Our results suggest an important role of P04271 SNPs on P04271 serum concentrations and P04271 mRNA expression . It hereby links recent evidence for both , the impact of P04271 gene variation on various neurological or psychiatric disorders like dementia , bipolar affective disorders and schizophrenia and the strong relation between P04271 serum levels and these disorders . High glucose-mediated imbalance of nitric oxide synthase and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase expression in endothelial cells . The mechanisms involved in endothelial dysfunction are multifactorial . A correlation between oxidative stress and derangements of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) pathways in altered endothelial homeostasis has been most studied and demonstrated in different pathophysiological conditions . NOS activities are regulated by endogenous inhibitors such as asymmetric DB01686 ( DB01686 ) that is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase ( DDAH ) . Since recent data demonstrated that some endothelial dysfunction may be related to reduced expression and/or activity of DDAH , the aim of the present research was to investigate the expression of O95865 and NOS isoforms in high glucose-mediated oxidative stress . Endothelial cells were incubated with normal ( 7 mM ) and high concentrations ( 33 mM ) of D-glucose for 5 days ; mannose ( 26 mM ) plus D-glucose ( 7 mM ) was used as osmotic control . Data obtained in the present study show that the exposure for 5 days to high glucose increases oxidative stress , reduces O95865 and P29474 expression and increases P35228 expression . These results indicate that O95865 and P35228 / P29474 dysregulation may play a key role in high glucose-mediated oxidative stress , suggesting that selective modulation of DDAH isoforms may result in selective inhibition/activation of NOS isoforms , thereby providing a novel strategy of approach in vascular complications of several pathologies . Pyrrolo[1,2-f]triazines as O60674 inhibitors : achieving potency and selectivity for O60674 over P52333 . SAR studies of pyrrolo[1,2-f]triazines as O60674 inhibitors is presented . Achieving O60674 inhibition selectively over P52333 is discussed . Could treatment with arundic acid ( DB05343 ) increase vulnerability for depression ? Arundic acid ( DB05343 ) is believed to be neuroprotective because of its actions on glia cells ; i.e. , its inhibitory effects on the synthesis of a calcium-binding protein P04271 . DB05343 is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of patients with stroke and Alzheimer 's disease . Recent clinical studies point to a pervasive comorbidity of depression with stroke and Alzheimer 's disease . Previously , P04271 has been implicated in the pathobiological mechanisms of depression . Preclinical studies have shown that antidepressant treatment significantly increases brain P04271 . Here we hypothesize that available data that link P04271 with depression , along with the proposed inhibitory action of DB05343 on P04271 synthesis , indicate that this compound could increase vulnerability for depression in patients at risk for this disorder , and we propose that evaluation of patients with stroke and Alzheimer 's disease for the presence of depression should be routine in clinical trials employing DB05343 . Although it may be open for discussion whether the neuroprotective effects of DB05343 are exclusively due to its inhibition of P04271 synthesis , the latter action of DB05343 warrants studies of the effects of this drug in the pathobiology of depression . DB06603 synergizes with bortezomib to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and ubiquitinated protein accumulation in renal cancer cells . BACKGROUND : Inducing endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress is a novel strategy used to treat malignancies . Inhibition of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) 6 by the HDAC inhibitor DB06603 hinders the refolding of unfolded proteins by increasing the acetylation of heat shock protein 90 . We investigated whether combining DB06603 with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib would kill cancer cells effectively by inhibiting the degradation of these unfolded proteins , thereby causing ubiquitinated proteins to accumulate and induce ER stress . METHODS : Caki-1 , ACHN , and 769-P cells were treated with DB06603 and/or bortezomib . Cell viability , clonogenicity , and induction of apoptosis were evaluated . The in vivo efficacy of the combination was evaluated using a murine subcutaneous xenograft model . The combination-induced ER stress and ubiquitinated protein accumulation were assessed . RESULTS : The combination of DB06603 and bortezomib induced apoptosis and inhibited renal cancer growth synergistically ( combination indexes < 1 ) . It also suppressed colony formation significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . In a murine subcutaneous tumor model , a 10-day treatment was well tolerated and inhibited tumor growth significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . Enhanced acetylation of the Q9UBN7 substrate alpha-tubulin was consistent with the suppression of Q9UBN7 activity by DB06603 , and the combination was shown to induce ER stress and ubiquitinated protein accumulation synergistically . CONCLUSIONS : DB06603 inhibits renal cancer growth by synergizing with bortezomib to induce ER stress and ubiquitinated protein accumulation . The current study provides a basis for testing the combination in patients with advanced renal cancer . Aripiprazole : a review of its use in the treatment of manic episodes in adolescents with bipolar I disorder . Aripiprazole ( DB01238 (®) ) is an atypical antipsychotic that is widely used in the treatment of psychiatric conditions . Unlike other currently available atypical antipsychotics that primarily have varying degrees of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism , aripiprazole is a partial agonist at D2 and serotonin P08908 receptors , which may explain differences in tolerability profiles . Recently in the EU , oral aripiprazole 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in adolescents ( aged ≥13 years ) with bipolar I disorder . Approval was based on a phase 3 , 30-week US trial in children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder experiencing manic or mixed episodes . Using trial data together with ancillary analyses , the European Medicines Agency concluded that aripiprazole 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks was effective in reducing symptoms of mania , but because of the high drop-out rate , efficacy over 30 weeks of treatment was not proven . Aripiprazole was generally well tolerated in the phase 3 trial . Ancillary analyses indicated that tolerability was less favourable in younger ( 10-12 years ) than in older ( ≥13 years ) subjects , and less favourable with the higher ( 30 mg/day ) than the lower dosage ( 10 mg/day ) . The drug is associated with sedation , weight gain and extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) , although the incidence of EPS over 12 weeks was not significantly different between aripiprazole 10 mg/day and placebo . Data comparing the use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of mania in adolescents with bipolar I disorder are limited , but evidence shows that aripiprazole provides a valuable additional therapeutic option for use in this population . Cyclic guanosine monophosphate responses to atrial natriuretic factor , brain natriuretic peptide , but not P23582 , and the characterization of their receptors in rat medullary thick ascending limb . The effects of atrial natriuretic factor ( ANF ) , brain natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) , and P23582 ( P09543 ) on renal medullary thick ascending limb ( mTAL ) have not been fully understood . The aim of this study is to examine the second-messenger responses of rat mTAL to ANF , DB04899 , and P09543 . Characterizations of the ANF , DB04899 , and P09543 receptors in mTAL were also performed by radioligand studies . Results showed that ANF and DB04899 were both capable of eliciting cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) responses in mTAL . Conversely , no cGMP response was observed upon stimulation by P09543 in mTAL . The presence of ANF receptors was demonstrated by radioligand studies . One receptor site was found , and the Kd and maximum binding capacity were 4.0 +/- 0.45 nmol/L and 277.8 +/- 47.7 fmol/mg protein , respectively . DB04899 receptors were also found in mTAL , and ANF and DB04899 were sharing the same receptor . On the contrary , no P09543 receptor could be shown by radioligand studies . These results suggest that guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors ( atrial natriuretic peptide receptor-A [ P16066 ] ) specific for ANF and DB04899 are present in rat mTAL , while those for P09543 ( P20594 ) are absent . ANF and DB04899 but not P09543 act on mTAL to control water excretion . The novel synthetic retinoid 6-[3-adamantyl-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid ( CD437 ) causes apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells through rapid activation of caspases . The synthetic retinoid 6-[3-adamantyl-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid ( CD437 ) , which was originally developed as an retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) -gamma agonist , induces rapid apoptosis in all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) -sensitive and DB00755 -resistant clones of the NB4 cell line , a widely used experimental model of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . In addition , the compound is apoptogenic in primary cultures of freshly isolated APL blasts obtained from a newly diagnosed case and an DB00755 -resistant relapsed patient . NB4 cells in the S-phase of the cycle are most sensitive to CD437-triggered apoptosis . CD437-dependent apoptosis does not require de novo protein synthesis and activation of P13631 or any of the other nuclear retinoic acid receptors . The process is preceded by rapid activation of a caspase-like enzymatic activity capable of cleaving the fluorogenic DEVD but not the fluorogenic YVAD tetrapeptide . Increased caspase activity correlates with caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation . Inhibition of caspases by z-VAD suppresses the nuclear DNA degradation observed in NB4 cells treated with CD437 , as well as the degradation of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-7 . CD437-dependent activation of caspases is preceded by release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol of treated cells . Leakage of cytochrome c lays upstream of caspase activation , because the phenomenon is left unaffected by pretreatment of NB4 cells with z-VAD . Treatment of APL cells with CD437 is associated with a caspase-dependent degradation of promyelocytic leukemia- P10276 , which can be completely inhibited by z-VAD . Neuronal ablation of p-Akt at Ser473 leads to altered P08908 /2A receptor function . The serotonergic system regulates a wide range of behavior , including mood and impulsivity , and its dysregulation has been associated with mood disorders , autism spectrum disorder , and addiction . Diabetes is a risk factor for these conditions . P01308 resistance in the brain is specifically associated with susceptibility to psychostimulant abuse . Here , we examined whether phosphorylation of Akt , a key regulator of the insulin signaling pathway , controls serotonin ( 5-HT ) signaling . To explore how impairment in Akt function regulates 5-HT homeostasis , we used a brain-specific rictor knockout ( KO ) mouse model of impaired neuronal phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 . Cortical P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptor binding was significantly elevated in rictor KO mice . Concomitant with this elevated receptor expression , the P08908 receptor agonist 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) led to an increased hypothermic response in rictor KO mice . The increased cortical P08908 receptor density was associated with higher P08908 receptor levels on the cortical cell surface . In contrast , rictor KO mice displayed significantly reduced head-twitch response ( HTR ) to the 5- Q13049 /C agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine ( DOI ) , with evidence of impaired 5- Q13049 /C receptor signaling . In vitro , pharmacological inhibition of Akt significantly increased P08908 receptor expression and attenuated DOI-induced 5- Q13049 receptor signaling , thereby lending credence to the observed in vivo cross-talk between neuronal Akt signaling and 5-HT receptor regulation . These data reveal that defective central Akt function alters 5-HT signaling as well as 5-HT-associated behaviors , demonstrating a novel role for Akt in maintaining neuronal 5-HT receptor function . Arundic acid ( DB05343 ) ameliorates delayed ischemic brain damage by preventing astrocytic overproduction of P04271 . After focal cerebral ischemia , the infarct volume increases rapidly within acute infarct expansion ( initial 12 to 24 h ) and continues slowly during delayed infarct expansion ( 25 to 168 h ) . While acute infarct expansion represents progressive necrosis within the ischemic core , delayed infarct expansion starts as disseminated apoptotic cell death in a narrow rim surrounding the infarct border , which gradually coalesces to form a larger infarct . Discovery of a distinct correlation between reactive astrogliosis along the infarct border and delayed infarct expansion in the rodent ischemia model led us to investigate the possible causal relationship between the two events . Specifically , the calcium binding protein P04271 exerts detrimental effects on cell survival through activation of various intracellular signaling pathways , resulting in altered protein expression . Arundic acid [ ( R ) -(-)-2-propyloctanoic acid , DB05343 ] is a novel agent that inhibits P04271 synthesis in cultured astrocytes . In the rodent ischemia model , this agent was shown to inhibit both the astrocytic overexpression of P04271 and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways in the peri-infarct area . Concurrently , delayed infarct expansion was prevented , and neurologic deficits were promptly ameliorated . The results of subsequent studies suggest that the efficacy of arundic acid is mediated by restoring the activity of astroglial glutamate transporters via enhanced genetic expression . Pulmonary arterial dysfunction in insulin resistant obese Zucker rats . BACKGROUND : P01308 resistance and obesity are strongly associated with systemic cardiovascular diseases . Recent reports have also suggested a link between insulin resistance with pulmonary arterial hypertension . The aim of this study was to analyze pulmonary vascular function in the insulin resistant obese Zucker rat . METHODS : Large and small pulmonary arteries from obese Zucker rat and their lean counterparts were mounted for isometric tension recording . mRNA and protein expression was measured by RT-PCR or Western blot , respectively . KV currents were recorded in isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells using the patch clamp technique . RESULTS : Right ventricular wall thickness was similar in obese and lean Zucker rats . Lung Q13873 , KV1.5 and 5- Q13049 receptor mRNA and protein expression and KV current density were also similar in the two rat strains . In conductance and resistance pulmonary arteries , the similar relaxant responses to acetylcholine and nitroprusside and unchanged lung P29474 expression revealed a preserved endothelial function . However , in resistance ( but not in conductance ) pulmonary arteries from obese rats a reduced response to several vasoconstrictor agents ( hypoxia , phenylephrine and 5-HT ) was observed . The hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors was reversed by L-NAME and prevented by the P35228 inhibitor 1400W . CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to rat models of type 1 diabetes or other mice models of insulin resistance , the obese Zucker rats did not show any of the characteristic features of pulmonary hypertension but rather a reduced vasoconstrictor response which could be prevented by inhibition of P35228 . Investigation of the hub genes and related mechanism in ovarian cancer via bioinformatics analysis . BACKGROUND : Ovarian cancer is a cancerous growth arising from the ovary . OBJECTIVE : This study was aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of the development and progression of the ovarian cancer . METHODS : We first identified the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) between the ovarian cancer samples and the healthy controls by analyzing the GSE14407 affymetrix microarray data , and then the functional enrichments of the DEGs were investigated . Furthermore , we constructed the protein-protein interaction network of the DEGs using the STRING online tools to find the genes which might play important roles in the progression of ovarian cancer . In addition , we performed the enrichment analysis to the PPI network . RESULTS : Our study screened 659 DEGs , including 77 up- and 582 down-regulated genes . These DEGs were enriched in pathways such as Cell cycle , p53 signaling pathway , Pathways in cancer and Drug metabolism . P24864 , O95067 and P20815 were the significant genes identified from these pathways . Protein-protein interaction ( PPI ) network was constructed and network Module A was found closely associated with ovarian cancer . Hub nodes such as P15692 , P62158 , O15392 and P28340 were found in the PPI network . Module A was related to biological processes such as mitotic cell cycle , cell cycle , nuclear division , and pathways namely Cell cycle , Oocyte meiosis and p53 signaling pathway . CONCLUSIONS : It indicated that ovarian cancer was closely associated to the dysregulation of p53 signaling pathway , drug metabolism , tyrosine metabolism and cell cycle . Besides , we also predicted genes such as P24864 , O95067 , P20815 and P15692 might be target genes for diagnosing the ovarian cancer . Regulation of P40763 by histone deacetylase-3 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma : implications for therapy . Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) with an activated B-cell ( DB01048 ) gene-expression profile has been shown to have a poorer prognosis compared with tumors with a germinal center B-cell type . ABC cell lines have constitutive activation of P40763 ; however , the mechanisms regulating P40763 signaling in lymphoma are unknown . In studies of class-I histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) expression , we found overexpression of O15379 in phospho P40763 -positive DLBCL and the O15379 was found to be complexed with P40763 . Inhibition of HDAC activity by DB06603 ( LBH589 ) increased p300-mediated P40763 (Lys685) acetylation with increased nuclear export of P40763 to the cytoplasm . HDAC inhibition abolished P40763 (Tyr705) phosphorylation with minimal effect on P40763 (Ser727) and O60674 tyrosine activity . pSTAT3(Tyr705)-positive DLBCLs were more sensitive to HDAC inhibition with LBH589 compared with pSTAT3(Tyr705)-negative DLBCLs . This cytotoxicity was associated with downregulation of the direct P40763 target Mcl-1 . O15379 knockdown upregulated P40763 (Lys685) acetylation but prevented P40763 (Tyr705) phosphorylation and inhibited survival of pSTAT3-positive DLBCL cells . These studies provide the rationale for targeting P40763 -positive DLBCL tumors with HDAC inhibitors . Genome-wide association studies identify P30532 /3 and Q13639 in the development of airflow obstruction . RATIONALE : Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified loci influencing lung function , but fewer genes influencing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) are known . OBJECTIVES : Perform meta-analyses of GWAS for airflow obstruction , a key pathophysiologic characteristic of P48444 assessed by spirometry , in population-based cohorts examining all participants , ever smokers , never smokers , asthma-free participants , and more severe cases . METHODS : Fifteen cohorts were studied for discovery ( 3,368 affected ; 29,507 unaffected ) , and a population-based family study and a meta-analysis of case-control studies were used for replication and regional follow-up ( 3,837 cases ; 4,479 control subjects ) . Airflow obstruction was defined as Q99581 (1) and its ratio to FVC ( Q99581 (1)/FVC ) both less than their respective lower limits of normal as determined by published reference equations . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The discovery meta-analyses identified one region on chromosome 15q25.1 meeting genome-wide significance in ever smokers that includes A2RU49 , P48200 , and P30532 / P32297 genes . The region was also modestly associated among never smokers . Gene expression studies confirmed the presence of P30532 /3 in lung , airway smooth muscle , and bronchial epithelial cells . A single-nucleotide polymorphism in Q13639 , a gene previously related to Q99581 (1)/FVC , achieved genome-wide statistical significance in combined meta-analysis . Top single-nucleotide polymorphisms in Q9H013 , P10826 , O14495 , and Q8TE59 were nominally replicated in the P48444 meta-analysis . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest an important role for the P30532 /3 region as a genetic risk factor for airflow obstruction that may be independent of smoking and implicate the Q13639 gene in the etiology of airflow obstruction . Combined treatment with DB02546 , bortezomib , and clarithromycin for concomitant targeting of aggresome formation and intracellular proteolytic pathways enhances ER stress-mediated cell death in breast cancer cells . The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the autophagy-lysosome pathway are two major intracellular protein degradation systems . We previously reported that clarithromycin ( P62158 ) blocks autophagy flux , and that combined treatment with P62158 and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( BZ ) enhances ER-stress-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells , whereas treatment with P62158 alone results in almost no cytotoxicity . Since Q9UBN7 is involved in aggresome formation , which is recognized as a cytoprotective response serving to sequester misfolded proteins and facilitate their clearance by autophagy , we further investigated the combined effect of vorinostat ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( DB02546 ) ) , which has a potent inhibitory effect for Q9UBN7 , with P62158 and BZ in breast cancer cell lines . DB02546 exhibited some cytotoxicity along with an increased acetylation level of α-tubulin , a substrate of Q9UBN7 . Combined treatment of DB02546 , P62158 , and BZ potently enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect compared with treatment using each reagent alone or a combination of two of the three . Expression levels of ER-stress-related genes , including the pro-apoptotic transcription factor P35638 ( P35638 ) , were maximally induced by the simultaneous combination of three reagents . Like breast cancer cell lines , a wild-type murine embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity and maximally up-regulated Chop after combined treatment with DB02546 , P62158 , and BZ ; however , a Chop knockout MEF cell line almost completely canceled this enhanced effect . The specific Q9UBN7 inhibitor tubacin also exhibited a pronounced cytocidal effect with a combination of P62158 plus BZ . These data suggest that simultaneous targeting of intracellular proteolytic pathways and Q9UBN7 enhances ER-stress-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells . Serotonin induces the expression of tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , or 5-HT ) , released from activated platelets , not only accelerates aggregation of platelets but also is known to promote mitosis , migration , and contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . These effects are considered to contribute to thrombus formation and atherosclerosis . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 5-HT on the expressions of coagulative and fibrinolytic factors in rat aortic endothelial cells . Endothelial cells were stimulated with various concentrations of 5-HT ( 0.1 approximately 10 microM ) , and the expressions of tissue factor ( TF ) , tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( P10646 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , and tissue-type plasminogen activator ( TPA ) messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) were evaluated by Northern blot analysis . The activities of TF and P05121 were also measured . TF and P05121 mRNA were increased significantly in a concentration- and time-dependent manner . However , P10646 and TPA mRNA expression did not change . The inductions of TF and P05121 mRNAs were inhibited by a 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist ( methiothepin ) and a selective 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist ( D6RGH6 -9042 ) . These results indicate that 5-HT increases procoagulant activity and reduces fibrinolytic activities of endothelial cells through the 5- Q13049 receptor . It was concluded that the modulation of procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic activities of endothelial cells by 5-HT synergistically promotes thrombus formation at the site of vessel injury with the platelet aggregation , VSMC contraction , and VSMC proliferation . Characterization of a novel Q13639 receptor antagonist of the azabicycloalkyl benzimidazolone class : DAU 6285 . Three chemical classes of serotonin Q13639 receptor agonists have been identified so far : 5-substituted indoles ( e.g. 5-HT ) , benzamides ( e.g. renzapride ) and benzimidazolones ( e.g. BIMU 8 ) . In a search for Q13639 receptor antagonists , we have discovered that the benzimidazolone derivative DAU 6285 ( for structure see text ) , is 3-5 times more potent than tropisetron in blocking 5-HT , renzapride and BIMU 8 induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in mouse embryo colliculi neurons . Schild plot analysis yielded Ki values of 220 , 181 and 255 nmol/l , respectively . In addition , DAU 6285 showed poor activity as a 5- Q9H205 receptor ligand with respect to tropisetron , as demonstrated by in vitro binding studies ( Ki , 322 vs 2.8 nmol/l ) and by its antagonistic activity in the Bezold-Jarisch reflex test ( ID50 , 231 vs 0.5 micrograms/kg , i.v. ) . No significant binding ( Ki greater than 10 mumol/l ) of DAU 6285 to serotonergic P08908 , P28222 , P28335 , P28221 , and 5-HT2 receptors as well as to adrenergic alpha 1 , alpha 2 , dopaminergic D1 , D2 or muscarinic M1-M3 receptor subtypes was found . The data indicate that DAU 6285 has a somewhat higher affinity than tropisetron for Q13639 receptors , a property confirmed in functional tests , and much lower affinity than tropisetron for 5- Q9H205 receptors . The compound represents a new interesting tool for investigating the pharmacological and physiological properties of Q13639 receptors . Blockade of P30556 reduces oxidative stress in adipose tissue and ameliorates adipocytokine dysregulation . Dysregulated production of adipocytokines may be involved in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associated with metabolic syndrome . The aim of this study was to determine the effects of treatment with angiotensin II ( Ang II ) type-1 receptor blocker ( ARB ) on the regulation of adipocytokines . DB00275 , an ARB , significantly blunted the age- and body weight-associated falls in plasma adiponectin both in genetically and diet-induced obese mice , without affecting body weight , but had no effect on plasma adiponectin levels in lean mice . DB00275 also ameliorated dysregulation of adipocytokines in obesity , such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and serum amyloid A3 . DB00275 significantly reduced reactive oxygen species originating from accumulated fat and attenuated the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phospho hydrogenase oxidase subunits in adipose tissue . In cultured adipocytes , olmesartan acted as an antioxidant and improved adipocytokine dysregulation . Our results indicate that blockade of Ang II receptor ameliorates adipocytokine dysregulation and that such action is mediated , at least in part , by targeting oxidative stress in obese adipose tissue . Ang II signaling and subsequent oxidative stress in adipose tissue may be potential targets for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in metabolic syndrome and also in metabolic syndrome-based CKD . [ Leukemia- and lymphoma-associated flow cytometric , cytogenetic , and molecular genetic aberrations in healthy individuals ] . Most leukemia and lymphoma cases are characterized by specific flow cytometric , cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations , which can also be detected in healthy individuals in some cases . The authors review the literature concerning monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis , and the occurrence of chromosomal translocations t(14;18) and t(11;14) , P06748 - Q9UM73 fusion gene , O60674 V617F mutation , P11274 - P00519 fusion gene , P41212 - Q01196 ( P41212 - Q01196 ) , Q03164 - P51825 and P29590 - P10276 fusion gene in healthy individuals . At present , we do not know the importance of these aberrations . From the authors review it is evident that this phenomenon has both theoretical and practical ( diagnostic , prognostic , and therapeutic ) significance . Expression of renin-angiotensin system components in the early bovine embryo . The renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) , mainly associated with the regulation of blood pressure , has been recently investigated in female reproductive organs and the developing foetus . Angiotensin II ( Ang II ) influences oviductal gamete movements and foetal development , but there is no information about DB01367 in the early embryo . The aim of this study was to determine whether DB01367 components are present in the pre-implantation embryo , to determine how early they are expressed and to investigate their putative role at this stage of development . Bovine embryos produced in vitro were used for analysis of DB01367 transcripts ( RT-PCR ) and localisation of the receptors P30556 and P50052 ( immunofluorescent labelling ) . We also investigated the effects of Ang II , DB00275 ( P30556 antagonist ) and PD123319 ( P50052 antagonist ) on oocyte cleavage , embryo expansion and hatching . Pre-implanted embryos possessed P30556 and P50052 but not the other DB01367 components . Both receptors were present in the trophectoderm and in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst . P30556 was mainly localised in granular-like structures in the cytoplasm , suggesting its internalisation into clathrin-coated vesicles , and P50052 was found mainly in the nuclear membrane and in the mitotic spindle of dividing trophoblastic cells . Treating embryos with PD123319 increased the proportion of hatched embryos compared with the control . These results , the first on DB01367 in the early embryo , suggest that the pre-implanted embryo responds to Ang II from the mother rather than from the embryo itself . This may be a route by which the maternal DB01367 influences blastocyst hatching and early embryonic development . Preclinical to clinical translation of tofacitinib , a Janus kinase inhibitor , in rheumatoid arthritis . A critical piece in the translation of preclinical studies to clinical trials is the determination of dosing regimens that allow maximum therapeutic benefit with minimum toxicity . The preclinical pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile of tofacitinib , an oral Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor , in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis ( mCIA ) model was compared with clinical PK/PD data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Preclinical evaluations included target modulation and PK/PD modeling based on continuous subcutaneous infusion or oral once- or twice-daily ( P55957 ) dosing paradigms in mice . The human PK/PD profile was obtained from pooled data from four phase 2 studies in patients with RA , and maximal effect models were used to evaluate efficacy after 12 weeks of tofacitinib treatment ( 1-15 mg P55957 ) . In mCIA , the main driver of efficacy was inhibition of cytokine receptor signaling mediated by P23458 heterodimers , but not O60674 homodimers , and continuous daily inhibition was not required to maintain efficacy . Projected efficacy could be predicted from total daily exposure irrespective of the oral dosing paradigm , with a total steady-state plasma concentration achieving 50 % of the maximal response ( Cave50 ) of ~100 nM . DB08895 potency ( ED50 ) in clinical studies was ~3.5 mg P55957 ( 90 % confidence interval : 2.3 , 5.5 ) or total Cave50 of ~40 nM , derived using Disease Activity Scores from patients with RA . The collective clinical and preclinical data indicated the importance of Cave as a driver of efficacy , rather than maximum or minimum plasma concentration ( Cmax or Cmin ) , where Cave50 values were within ~2-fold of each other . Aripiprazole : pharmacodynamics of a dopamine partial agonist for the treatment of schizophrenia . Aripiprazole is the first approved atypical antipsychotic with a mechanism of action that exerts a partial agonism with high affinity at DB00988 D2- and Serotonin- P08908 -receptors as well as an antagonism at Serotonin-5- Q13049 -receptors . Aripiprazole provides good clinical effectiveness and a favorable profile of safety and tolerability . The special pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole are described herein . Ca2+-calmodulin and janus kinase 2 are required for activation of sodium-proton exchange by the Gi-coupled 5-hydroxytryptamine 1a receptor . The type 1 sodium-proton exchanger ( P19634 ) is expressed ubiquitously and regulates key cellular functions , including mitogenesis , cell volume , and intracellular pH . Despite its importance , the signaling pathways that regulate P19634 remain incompletely defined . In this work , we present evidence that stimulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A ( P08908 ) receptor results in the formation of a signaling complex that includes activated O60674 ( Jak2 ) , Ca2+/calmodulin ( P62158 ) , and P19634 , and which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of P62158 . The signaling pathway also involves rapid agonist-induced association of P62158 and P19634 as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation studies and by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies in living cells . We propose that P19634 is activated through this pathway : P08908 receptor --> G(i2)alpha and/or G(i3)alpha --> Jak2 activation --> tyrosine phosphorylation of P62158 --> increased binding of P62158 to P19634 --> induction of a conformational change in P19634 that unmasks an obscured proton-sensing and/or proton-transporting region of P19634 --> activation of P19634 . The G(i/o)-coupled P08908 receptor now joins a handful of Gq-coupled receptors and hypertonic shock as upstream activators of this emerging pathway . In the course of this work , we have presented clear evidence that P62158 can be activated through tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of a significant role for elevated intracellular Ca2+ . We have also shown for the first time that the association of P62158 with P19634 in living cells is a dynamic process . DB01686 and oxidative stress . Elevated plasma concentrations of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine ( DB01686 ) represent a novel risk factor for the development of endothelial dysfunction and a predictor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality . However , it is unknown whether elevated DB01686 plasma concentrations may be considered simply as a marker for cardiovascular disease or whether increased DB01686 levels per se may predispose to the development of vascular disease . There is experimental and clinical evidence linking endothelial dysfunction to increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals such as superoxide anion . Oxidative stress has been shown to increase the activity of arginine methylating and DB01686 degrading enzymes leading to increased DB01686 concentrations . Interestingly , the endothelial nitric oxide synthase may become uncoupled in the presence of high DB01686 levels further contributing to the vascular oxidative stress burden . It remains to be established to what extent DB01686 is able to interact with P29474 in vivo . Possible mechanisms underlying increased oxidative stress in the setting of elevated DB01686 concentrations and therapeutic implications will be discussed . P51955 mediates P00352 -dependent drug resistance in multiple myeloma . We reported previously that increased expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ( P00352 ) in multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a marker of tumor-initiating cells ( TICs ) that is further associated with chromosomal instability ( Q96GD0 ) . Here we demonstrate that member A1 of the P00352 family of proteins , P00352 , is most abundantly expressed in myeloma . Enforced expression of P00352 in myeloma cells led to increased clonogenicity , tumor formation in mice , and resistance to myeloma drugs in vitro and in vivo . The mechanism underlying these phenotypes included the P00352 -dependent activation of drug-efflux pump , P08183 , and survival proteins , AKT and P10415 . Over expression of P00352 in myeloma cells led to increased mRNA and protein levels of NIMA-related kinase 2 ( P51955 ) , whereas shRNA-mediated knock down of P51955 decreased drug efflux pump activity and drug resistance . The activation of P51955 in myeloma cells relied on the P00352 -dependent generation of the retinoid X receptor α ( RXRα ) ligand , 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9CRA ) - not the retinoic acid receptor α ( RARα ) ligand , all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) . These findings implicate the P00352 -RXRα- P51955 pathway in drug resistance and disease relapse in myeloma and suggest that specific inhibitors of P00352 are worthy of consideration for clinical development of new approaches to overcome drug resistance in myeloma . Normal and perturbed endothelial cells from canine femoral arteries and femoral veins exhibit heterogeneity in hemostatic properties and growth characteristics . BACKGROUND : We sought to examine the heterogeneity of endothelial cells from the same anatomic site but different vascular systems and described P04275 ( P04275 ) release and morphological change in response to injury-associated factor in femoral vessels from canine in vitro . METHODS : Levels of hemostatic factors ( P04275 , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1( P05121 ) , antithrombin III ( P01008 ) , in tissue sections and cultured endothelial cells of canine femoral arteries and canine femoral veins were compared by the immunohistochemistry technique . In addition to comparing cell growth density and cell protein contents , cultured femoral arterial endothelial cells ( FAECs ) and cultured femoral venous endothelial cells ( FVECs ) were incubated with a series concentration of basic fibroblast factor ( P09038 ) ( 1 , 10 , 100 ng/ml ) for up to 48 hours to test the amount of P04275 secretion and morphological change . RESULTS : Both in tissue sections and cultured cells , the levels of P04275 are higher in FVECs than in FAECs . We were unable to differentiate the level of P05121 and P01008 difference between FAECs and FVECs. P09038 ( 10 ng/ml ) significantly increased P04275 secretion from cultured FAECs but not from FVECs . The size of cultured FAECs is smaller than of FVECs ; however , FAECs have higher amounts of protein contents than FVECs . CONCLUSIONS : These comparative studies provide evidence indicating that the characteristics of FVECs differ from those of FAECs . These differences may be indicated heterogeneity with either inherited or acquired thrombotic disease . Agonist-promoted down-regulation and functional desensitization in two naturally occurring variants of the human serotonin1A receptor . We recently reported two naturally occurring polymorphisms of the human serotonin1A ( P08908 ) receptor : glycine22 --> serine ( Ser22 ) and isoleucine28 --> valine ( Val28 ) in the putative aminoterminal domain of the receptor . To investigate the regulatory properties of these variants , the wild type ( WT ) and variant P08908 receptors were stably expressed in CHO- P04264 cells . WT , Ser22 , and Val28 displayed similar high-affinity binding to [ 3H ] -8-OH-DPAT . Competition experiments with P08908 agonists and antagonists demonstrated similar pharmacological profiles . Receptor agonist-promoted down-regulation was tested by exposure to 100 mumol/L 8-OH-DPAT . After 24-h exposure , WT and Val28 underwent 59.3 +/- 3.9 % and 59.5 +/- 1.4 % reduction in receptor density respectively , whereas the degree of down-regulation was significantly lower for Ser22 ( 21.4 +/- 4.2 % ) . Cell treatment for 24 h with 100 mumol/L 8-OH-DPAT reduced the 5-HT-induced inhibition of DB02527 accumulation by 24.9 +/- 5.1 % for WT and 16.4 +/- 0.8 % for Val28 , but only by 4.8 +/- 3 % for Ser22 . We conclude that the Ser22 variant is capable of attenuating agonist-mediated receptor down-regulation and desensitization . Induction of apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma cells by AHPN/CD437 is mediated by retinoic acid receptors . Retinoids have great promise in the area of cancer therapy and chemoprevention . These natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A have been shown to play an important role in regulating cell differentiation and proliferation . While all-trans-retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of several ovarian tumor cell lines , other ovarian carcinoma cell lines have been found to be resistant to retinoid dependent growth suppression . Interestingly , a novel synthetic retinoid , CD437 or AHPN , has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of both DB00755 -sensitive ( CA-OV3 ) and DB00755 -resistant ( SK-OV3 ) ovarian tumor cell lines as well as to induce apoptosis . The overall goal of this research was to understand the mechanism by which AHPN/CD437 induces apoptosis in ovarian tumor cell lines . Since a number of studies have demonstrated the importance of nuclear receptors ( RARs and RXRs ) in mediating cellular responses to retinoids , we wished to determine the role of RARs in mediating the AHPN/CD437 response . We modulated RAR level and function by overexpressing either wild type P13631 or a pan dominant negative mutant of all RAR subtypes called P10826 ( R269Q ) , or through the use of an P13631 antagonist , MM11253 . We found that inhibition of RAR function reduced but did not eliminate induction of apoptosis in both CA-OV3 and SK-OV3 cells by AHPN/CD437 . Likewise , overexpression of wild type P13631 was found to increase apoptosis after treatment with AHPN/CD437 . Our results suggest that in ovarian carcinomas , AHPN/CD437 induced apoptosis is mediated at least in part via an RAR pathway . Growth rates of hprt and tk mutant CHO cell lines . The growth rates of 31 X-ray-induced hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase ( hprt ) deficient mutants of CHO- P04264 cells were measured . Mutants had been classified as ( 1 ) full-deletion , ( 2 ) partial deletion or rearrangement , or ( 3 ) unchanged by Southern blot analyses . No relationship between growth rate and deletion type was observed . Even where all hprt-specific bands were missing , proliferation rates in culture were normal . Additionally , in CHO- P01008 -2 cells , which are heterozygous at the tk locus , no difference in growth rates between a spontaneous hprt mutant and its parent was observed , although double hprt-tk-/- mutants grew more slowly . Role of the P08908 receptor in development of the neonatal rat brain : preliminary behavioral studies . Serotonin exerts an influence on the prenatal development of rat brain . However , later developmental times may be more applicable to the understanding of the role of serotonin in human developmental disorders . Therefore , the current study was undertaken to gain preliminary information on the postnatal effects of serotonin on rat brain development . As the P08908 receptor has been shown to be involved in much of the developmental functions of serotonin , an agonist for this receptor , 8-hydroxy-DPAT ( 8-OH-DPAT ) , was used . Neonatal rat pups at three ages ( postnatal days , PNDs ) 3-10 , 10-17 or 17-24 ) were injected daily with 1 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT and evaluated for behavioral consequences . The youngest group showed accelerated incisor eruption and eye-opening , a possible consequence of P08908 receptor interactions with epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) . Behaviorally , the animals were more anxious . Animals treated from P01160 10-17 , showed no change in craniofacial development but showed greater behavioral maturity in measures of spontaneous alternation and activity in the open field . The oldest animals ( P01160 17-24 ) showed no behavioral alterations , suggesting that this time length is beyond the critical period for serotonin 's influence in brain development . Activation of the JAK/ P35610 pathway in vascular smooth muscle by serotonin . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) is a vasoconstrictor and mitogen whose levels are elevated in diabetes . Previous studies have shown the presence of 5- Q13049 , P41595 , and P28222 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . There are currently no data regarding P41595 and P28222 receptor activation of the JAK/ P35610 pathway in VSMCs and resultant potential alterations in 5-HT signaling in diabetes . Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT differentially activates the JAK/ P35610 pathway in VSMCs under conditions of normal ( 5 mM ) and high ( 25 mM ) glucose . Treatment of rat VSMCs with 5-HT ( 10(-6) M ) resulted in time-dependent activation ( approximately 2-fold ) of O60674 , P23458 , and P42224 , but not P40763 ( maximal at 5 min , returned to baseline by 30 min ) . The P41595 receptor agonist BW723C86 and the P28222 receptor agonist CGS12066A ( 10(-9)-10(-5) M , 5-min stimulation ) did not activate the JAK/ P35610 pathway . Treatment with the 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist ketanserin ( 10 nM ) inhibited O60674 activation by 5-HT . Treatment of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with ketanserin ( 5 mg.kg-1.day-1 ) reduced activation of O60674 and P42224 but not P40763 in endothelium-denuded thoracic aorta in vivo . 5-HT ( 10(-6) M ) treatment resulted in increased cell proliferation and increased DNA synthesis , which were inhibited by the O60674 inhibitor AG490 . Further studies with apocynin , diphenyleneiodonium chloride , catalase , and virally transfected superoxide dismutase had no effect at either glucose concentration on activation of the JAK/ P35610 pathway by 5-HT . Therefore , we conclude that 5-HT activates O60674 , P23458 , and P42224 via the 5- Q13049 receptors in a reactive oxygen species-independent manner under both normal and high glucose conditions . Immunohistochemical analysis of brain lesions using P04271 and glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies in arundic acid- ( DB05343 ) treated stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats . Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRSP ) used as a model of essential hypertension cause a high incidence of brain stroke on the course of hypertension . Incidences and sizes of brain lesions are known to relate to the astrocyte activities . Therefore , relation between brain damage and the expression profile of the astrocytes was investigated with morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses using astrocyte marker antibodies of P04271 and glial fibrillary acidic protein ( P14136 ) with or without arundic acid administration , a suppressor on the activation of astrocytes . Arundic acid extended the average life span of SHRSP . An increase in brain tissue weight was inhibited concomitant with a lower rate of gliosis/hemosiderin deposit/scarring in brain lesions . P04271 - or P14136 -positive dot and filamentous structures were decreased in arundic acid-treated SHRSP , and this effect was most pronounced in the cerebral cortex , white matter , and pons , and less so in the hippocampus , diencephalon , midbrain , and cerebellum . Blood pressure decreased after administration of arundic acid in the high-dose group ( 100 mg/kg/day arundic acid ) , but not in the low-dose group ( 30 mg/kg/day ) . These data indicate that arundic acid can prevent hypertension-induced stroke , and may inhibit the enlargement of the stroke lesion by preventing the inflammatory changes caused by overproduction of the P04271 protein in the astrocytes . Comparison of effects of olmesartan and telmisartan on blood pressure and metabolic parameters in Japanese early-stage type-2 diabetics with hypertension . P30556 blockers ( ARBs ) are regarded as first-line treatments for type-2 diabetes with hypertension . Despite the availability of various types of ARBs , there are no comparative studies of their effects on patients with diabetes . In this open-label prospective crossover study , we compared the effects of olmesartan ( 20 mg/day ) and telmisartan ( 40 mg/day ) . Twenty Japanese early-stage type-2 diabetes patients with hypertension treated with valsartan ( 80 mg/day ) for at least 8 weeks were recruited to this study . At study entry , valsartan was changed to olmesartan ( 20 mg/day ) or telmisartan ( 40 mg/day ) and administered for 8 weeks . The drugs were then switched and treatment was continued for another 8 weeks . We analyzed the blood pressure lowering effects of each drug by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at 0 , 8 , and 16 weeks . Simultaneously , we measured metabolic parameters and inflammation markers . DB00275 lowered mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure more significantly than did telmisartan . While there were no differences between the groups in metabolic parameters , including HbA1c and adiponectin , the decreases in serum interleukin-6 and highly sensitive P02741 were more significant by olmesartan treatment . Our results indicate that olmesartan has more potent arterial blood pressure lowering and anti-inflammatory effects than telmisartan .
The role of Q12809 K+ channels and a functional link between Q12809 K+ channels and P48061 in acute leukemic cell migration . Stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( P48061 ) and its unique receptor , P61073 , regulate stem/progenitor cell migration and retention in the bone marrow and are required for hematopoiesis . Recent studies found that Q12809 K(+) channels were important regulators of tumor cell migration . In this study , we investigated whether P48061 induced acute leukemic cell migration associated with Q12809 K(+) channels . Our results showed that E-4031 , a specific Q12809 K(+) channels inhibitor , significantly blocked P48061 -induced migration of leukemic cell lines , primary acute leukemic cells , leukemic stem cells and HEK293T cells transfected with herg-pEGFP . The migration of phenotypically recognizable subsets gave the indication that lymphoblastic leukemic cells were inhibited more than myeloid cells while in the presence of E-4031 which maybe associated with herg expression . P48061 increased Q12809 K(+) current expressed in oocytes and HEK293T cells transfected with herg-pEGFP . There were no significant changes of P61073 expression on both HL-60 cells and primary leukemic cells regardless if untreated or treated with E-4031 for 24 h ( P > 0.05 ) . The Q12809 K(+) current increased by P48061 might contribute to the mechanism of P48061 -induced leukemic cell migration . The data suggested that Q12809 K(+) channels functionally linked to cell migration induced by P48061 . No activation of human pregnane X receptor by hyperforin-related phloroglucinols . The acylated phloroglucinol , hyperforin , the main active ingredient of St . John 's Wort , exerts antidepressant properties via indirect inhibition of serotonin reuptake by selectively activating the canonical transient receptor potential channel 6 ( Q9Y210 ) . DB01892 treatment can lead to drug-drug interactions due to potent activation of the nuclear receptor O75469 ( O75469 ) , a key transcriptional regulator of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport . It was previously shown that synthetic acylated phloroglucinol derivatives activate Q9Y210 with similar potency as hyperforin . However , their interaction potential with O75469 remained unknown . Here we investigated five synthetic Q9Y210 -activating phloroglucinol derivatives and four Q9Y210 -nonactivating compounds compared with hyperforin and rifampicin for their potential to activate O75469 in silico and in vitro . Computational O75469 pharmacophore modeling did not indicate potent agonist or antagonist interactions for the Q9Y210 -activating derivatives , whereas one of them was suggested by docking studies to show both agonist and antagonist interactions . DB01892 and rifampicin treatment of HepG2 cells cotransfected with human O75469 expression vector and a P08684 promoter-reporter construct resulted in potent O75469 -dependent induction , whereas all Q9Y210 -activating compounds failed to show any O75469 activation or to antagonize rifampicin-mediated P08684 promoter induction . DB01892 and rifampicin treatment of primary human hepatocytes resulted in highly correlated induction of O75469 target genes , whereas treatment with the phloroglucinol derivatives elicited moderate gene expression changes that were only weakly correlated with those of rifampicin and hyperforin treatment . These results show that Q9Y210 -activating phloroglucinols do not activate O75469 and should therefore be promising new candidates for further drug development . Gain-of-function mutations in transient receptor potential P13671 ( Q9Y210 ) activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) . Gain-of-function mutations in the canonical transient receptor potential 6 ( Q9Y210 ) gene are a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) . The mechanisms whereby abnormal Q9Y210 activity results in proteinuria remain unknown . The P27361 /2 MAPKs are activated in glomeruli and podocytes in several proteinuric disease models . We therefore examined whether FSGS-associated mutations in Q9Y210 result in activation of these kinases . In 293T cells and cultured podocytes , overexpression of gain-of-function Q9Y210 mutants resulted in increased P27361 /2 phosphorylation , an effect dependent upon channel function . Pharmacologic inhibitor studies implicated several signaling mediators , including calmodulin and calcineurin , supporting the importance of Q9Y210 -mediated calcium influx in this process . Through medium transfer experiments , we uncovered two distinct mechanisms for P29323 activation by mutant Q9Y210 , a cell-autonomous , P01133 receptor-independent mechanism and a non-cell-autonomous mechanism involving metalloprotease-mediated release of a presumed P01133 receptor ligand . The inhibitors KN-92 and H89 were able to block both pathways in mutant Q9Y210 expressing cells as well as the prolonged elevation of intracellular calcium levels upon carbachol stimulation seen in these cells . However , these effects appear to be independent of their effects on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and PKA , respectively . Phosphorylation of DB00156 -70 , DB00133 -282 , and DB00135 -31/285 were not necessary for P29323 activation by mutant Q9Y210 , although a phosphomimetic Q9Y210 S282E mutant was capable of P29323 activation . Taken together , these results identify two pathways downstream of mutant Q9Y210 leading to P29323 activation that may play a role in the development of FSGS . [ Changes in chemokine receptor 4 , interleukin-6 , and collagen X expression in the ATDC5 cell line stimulated by cyclic tensile strain and stromal cell-derived factor-1 ] . OBJECTIVE : This study further explores the stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( P48061 ) /chemokine receptor 4 ( P61073 ) signaling axis mechanism in temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis ( OA ) by detecting the changes in P61073 , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , and collagen X expression in the ATDC5 cell line stimulated by the cyclic tensile strain and P48061 . METHODS : P01308 -transferrin-selenium ( ITS ) was used to induce ATDC5 cells to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells . After three weeks , the cells were divided into two groups : those with and without cyclic tensile strain . These groups were further divided into the negative control and P48061 groups . Strain force of 20 % was applied . After 12 h , the total proteins were extracted from cells of the four groups , and Western blot analysis was used to detect the changes in P61073 , P05231 , and collagen X expression . RESULTS : P48061 could enhance P61073 , P05231 , and collagen X expressions in the chondrocytes , and 20 % tensile strain force could further upregulate the three factors . CONCLUSION : Under abnormal tensile force , P48061 can upregulate its specific receptor P61073 , thus increasing its-binding efficiency and resulting in the activation of the P48061 / P61073 axis . This condition enhances the expressions of P05231 and other inflammatory factors and directly damages to cartilage tissue . Such damage directly promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy , which enhances collagen X expression . P01308 action on H292 bronchial carcinoma cells as compared to normal bronchial epithelial cells . DB00030 may contribute to bronchial carcinoma due to P08069 activation by high local concentrations . Therefore , effects of insulin and P05019 on human bronchial carcinoma cells ( H292 ) and normal bronchial epithelium cells ( P02100 ) were studied . TGF-β was included since it also influences carcinoma progression . H292 and P02100 cells expressed both the insulin receptor and the P08069 ; in H292 cells an additional , shorter , splicing variant ( IR-A ) of the insulin receptor was present . P06213 expression was around four to five times higher in H292 than in P02100 cells at mRNA and protein levels . P01308 and TGF-β exerted contrary actions on proliferation and gene expression in H292 cells . Genes regulated by insulin , P05019 , and TGF-β were linked to inflammation , cell adhesion , muscle contraction and differentiation . P01308 and P05019 also suppressed DNA repair genes . EC(50) for insulin-induced proliferation was around 5 nM in H292 and around 30 nM P02100 cells . The EC(50) values for gene expression ranged from 9 to 90 nM in both cell types , dependent on the gene studied . In H292 cells , the proliferative response was much stronger if TGF-β was present . In P02100 cells this interaction of insulin and TGF-β was not observed , and changes in gene expression were mostly lower by at least 10-fold as compared to H292 . All in all , the insulin effects in H292 were generally much stronger than in P02100 cells and - with regard to proliferation - occurred at lower concentrations . Thus , insulin will hardly induce cancer from normal bronchial cells but may favour progression of pre-existing tumours . Transcript profiling in peripheral T-cell lymphoma , not otherwise specified , and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identifies distinct tumor profile signatures . To glean biological differences and similarities of peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified [ PTCL-NOS ] to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , a transcriptosome analysis was done on five PTCL-NOS and four DLBCL patients and validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR on 10 selected genes . Normal peripheral blood T cells , peripheral blood B cells , and lymph node were used as controls . The resultant gene expression profile delineated distinct " tumor profile signatures " for PTCL-NOS and DLBCL . Several highly overexpressed genes in both PTCL-NOS and DLBCL involve the immune network , stroma , angiogenesis , and cell survival cascades that make important contributions to lymphomagenesis . Inflammatory chemokines and their receptors likely play a central role in these complex interrelated pathways : P13500 and P61073 in PTCL-NOS and P13501 and P32246 in DLBCL . Highly overexpressed oncogenes unique to PTCL-NOS are P17947 , O14965 , alpha- P09619 , and O60880 , whereas in DLBCL they are P11309 , Q9P1W9 , P07948 , Q16548 , and P51153 . Oncogenes common to both lymphomas are Q9Y5Q3 , MET , NF-kappaB2 , P06239 , and P07948 . Several tumor suppressors are also down-regulated ( P56180 , MGC154 , Q13635 , P78524 , and P41567 ) . This study illustrates the relevance of tumor-stroma immune trafficking and identified potential novel prognostic markers and targets for therapeutic intervention . Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors reduce human dendritic cell inflammatory cytokine production and Th1-polarizing capacity . Inhibitors of DB02527 -specific phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) 4 have been shown to inhibit inflammatory mediator release and T cell proliferation , and are considered candidate therapies for T(h)1-mediated diseases . However , little is known about how DB05876 inhibitors influence dendritic cells ( DC ) , the cells responsible for the priming of naive T(h) cells . Therefore , we investigated the PDE profile of monocyte-derived DC , and whether DB05876 inhibitors modulate DC cytokine production and T cell-polarizing capacity . We mainly found DB02527 -specific DB05876 enzymatic activity in both immature and mature DC . In contrast to monocytes that mainly express Q07343 , we found that P27815 is the predominant DB05876 subtype present in DC . Immature DC showed reduced ability to produce IL-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha upon lipopolysaccharide or P29965 ( P29965 ) stimulation in the presence of DB05876 inhibitors , whereas cytokine production upon P29965 stimulation of fully mature DC in the presence of DB05876 inhibitors was not affected . Exposure to DB05876 inhibitors for 2 days during DC maturation did not influence T cell-stimulatory capacity or acquisition of a mature phenotype , but increased the expression of the chemokine receptor P61073 . Furthermore , DC matured in the presence of DB05876 inhibitors showed reduced capacity to produce IL-12p70 and P01375 upon subsequent P29965 stimulation . Using these DB05876 inhibitor-matured DC to stimulate naive T cells resulted in a reduction of P01579 -producing ( T(h)1 ) cells . These findings indicate that DB05876 inhibitors can affect T cell responses by acting at the DC level and may increase our understanding of the therapeutic implication of DB05876 inhibitors for T(h)1-mediated disorders . Comparison of three GPCR structural templates for modeling of the Q9H244 nucleotide receptor . The P2Y(12) receptor ( P2Y(12)R ) is an ADP-activated G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) that is an important target for antithrombotic drugs . Three homology models of P2Y(12)R were compared , based on different GPCR structural templates : bovine rhodopsin ( bRHO ) , human A(2A) adenosine receptor ( A(2A)AR ) , and human P61073 ( P61073 ) . By criteria of sequence analysis ( 25.6 % identity in transmembrane region ) , deviation from helicity in the second transmembrane helix ( TM2 ) , docked poses of ligands highlighting the role of key residues , accessibility of a conserved disulfide bridge that is reactive toward irreversibly-binding antagonists , and the presence of a shared disulfide bridge between the third extracellular loop ( EL3 ) and the N-terminus , the P61073 -based model appeared to be the most consistent with known characteristics of P2Y(12)R . The docked poses of agonist 2MeSADP and charged anthraquinone antagonist PSB-0739 in the binding pocket of P2Y(12)R-CXC agree with previously published site-directed mutagenesis studies of Arg256 and Lys280 . A sulfonate at position 2 of the anthraquinone core created a strong interaction with the Lys174(EL2) side chain . The docking poses of the irreversibly-binding , active metabolite ( existing as two diastereoisomers in vivo ) of the clinically utilized antagonist DB00758 were compared . The free thiol group of the 4S diastereoisomer , but not the 4R isomer , was found in close proximity ( ~4.7 Å ) to the sulfur atom of a disulfide bridge involving Cys175 , suggesting greater activity in covalent binding . Therefore , ligand docking to the P61073 -based model of the P2Y(12)R predicted poses of both reversibly and irreversibly-binding small molecules , consistent with observed pharmacology and mutagenesis studies . DB01093 -treated HL60 cells : a model of neutrophil-like cells mainly expressing Q07343 subtype . The human promyelocytic HL60 cells acquired a neutrophilic phenotype after a 7- to 10-day DB01093 treatment . Fc gammaRII was up-regulated . Fc gammaRI was also up-regulated by an additional P01579 treatment . These cells are able to produce O2*- by NADPH oxidase activation in the presence of immune complexes or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) . A change of their DB05876 subtype profile was also observed : Q07343 was the predominant isoenzyme , Q08499 was down-regulated and P27815 was no longer detectable . Additionally , the more NADPH oxidase was activated by PMA , the less P27815 was expressed , suggesting that NADPH oxidase activity could be used as a surrogate marker of P27815 down-regulation . DB01954 and DB03849 ( cilomilast ) , two selective DB05876 inhibitors , dose-dependently inhibited receptor-coupled activation of superoxide . These results suggest that Q07343 is the main subtype involved in regulating superoxide induced by Fc gammaRs activation . Furthermore , these cells , expressing almost exclusively Q07343 subtype , could be useful to identify selective Q07343 inhibitors . [ Medication of the month. DB08816 ( Brilique ) : potent oral antagonist of platelet activity ] . Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel combined with aspirin reduces ischemic events in acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) . The individual response to clopidogrel is , however , very variable from one subject to another , and the risk of events seems higher when platelet inhibition is insufficient . DB08816 is a potent oral inhibitor of platelet activity . It binds reversibly to the Q9H244 adenosine diphosphate . The platelet inhibition that it induces is faster and more pronounced than that of clopidogrel . In patients who have an ACS ( PLATO study ) with or without ST-segment elevation , treatment with ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel significantly reduced the rate of death from vascular causes , myocardial infarction , or stroke , without an increase in the rate of overall major bleeding but with an increase in the rate of non-procedure-related bleeding . In Belgium , Brilique is currently indicated in combination with aspirin for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with ACS . Acute renal failure from hemoglobinuric and interstitial nephritis secondary to iodine and mefenamic acid . DB00784 ingestion , usually in excess and over prolonged period is known to produce interstitial nephritis , or less commonly papillary necrosis , with acute renal failure . However , it is not dose-dependent for the induction of tubulointerstitial damage . Excess iodine ingestion is known to produce toxicity and possible death , but acute renal failure is rare . There is evidence from clinical and experimental data that iodine has toxic effect on tubular epithelial cells . Iodine has not been documented to produce red cell hemolysis and hemoglobinuria . We present a unique case of acute renal failure from hemoglobinuric and acute interstitial nephritis secondary to suicidal ingestion of potassium iodide solution and also ingestion of a few mefenamic acid tablets . These agents led to potentiation of the renal injury from hemoglobinuric tubulopathy , probably from the iodine , and renal dysfunction from alteration of renal perfusion by selective P23219 inhibition of prostaglandin production , and induction of acute interstitial nephritis from mefenamic acid , leading to acute renal failure which was reversible by hemodialysis and supportive therapy . DB00452 -arginine conjugate , a novel HIV-1 Tat antagonist : synthesis and anti-HIV activities . HIV-1 transactivating protein Tat is essential for virus replication and progression of HIV disease . HIV-1 Tat stimulates transactivation by binding to HIV-1 transactivator responsive element ( TAR ) RNA , and while secreted extracellularly , it acts as an immunosuppressor , an activator of quiescent T-cells for productive HIV-1 infection , and by binding to CXC chemokine receptor type 4 ( P61073 ) as a chemokine analogue . Here we present a novel HIV-1 Tat antagonist , a neomycin B-hexaarginine conjugate ( NeoR ) , which inhibits Tat transactivation and antagonizes Tat extracellular activities , such as increased viral production , induction of P61073 expression , suppression of CD3-activated proliferation of lymphocytes , and upregulation of the CD8 receptor . Moreover , Tat inhibits binding of fluoresceine isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -labeled NeoR to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , indicating that Tat and NeoR bind to the same cellular target . This is further substantiated by the finding that NeoR competes with the binding of monoclonal Abs to P61073 . Furthermore , NeoR suppresses HIV-1 binding to cells . Importantly , NeoR accumulates in the cell nuclei and inhibits the replication of M- and T-tropic HIV-1 laboratory isolates ( EC(50) = 0.8-5.3 microM ) . A putative model structure for the TAR-NeoR complex , which complies with available experimental data , is presented . We conclude that NeoR is a multitarget HIV-1 inhibitor ; the structure , and molecular modeling and dynamics , suggest its binding to TAR RNA . NeoR inhibits HIV-1 binding to cells , partially by blocking the P61073 HIV-1 coreceptor , and it antagonizes Tat functions . NeoR is therefore an attractive lead compound , capable of interfering with different stages of HIV infection and AIDS pathogenesis . Association study of 25 type 2 diabetes related Loci with measures of obesity in Indian sib pairs . Obesity is an established risk factor for type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and they are metabolically related through the mechanism of insulin resistance . In order to explore how common genetic variants associated with T2D correlate with body mass index ( BMI ) , we examined the influence of 25 T2D associated loci on obesity risk . We used 5056 individuals ( 2528 sib-pairs ) recruited in Indian Migration Study and conducted within sib-pair analysis for six obesity phenotypes . We found associations of variants in P61073 ( rs932206 ) and Q03014 ( rs5015480 ) with higher body mass index ( BMI ) ( β=0.13 , p=0.001 ) and ( β=0.09 , p=0.002 ) , respectively and weight ( β=0.13 , p=0.001 ) and ( β=0.09 , p=0.001 ) , respectively . P61073 variant was also strongly associated with body fat ( β=0.10 , p=0.0004 ) . In addition , we demonstrated associations of P61073 and Q03014 with overweight/obesity ( OR=1.6 , p=0.003 ) and ( OR=1.4 , p=0.002 ) , respectively , in 1333 sib-pairs ( 2666 individuals ) . We observed marginal evidence of associations between variants at six loci ( Q9NQB0 , Q9Y4Z2 , Q9Y261 , LOC646279 , FLJ39370 and Q6YHU6 ) and waist hip ratio ( WHR ) , BMI and/or overweight which needs to be validated in larger set of samples . All the above findings were independent of daily energy consumption and physical activity level . The risk score estimates based on eight significant loci ( including nominal associations ) showed associations with WHR and body fat which were independent of BMI . In summary , we establish the role of T2D associated loci in influencing the measures of obesity in Indian population , suggesting common underlying pathophysiology across populations . Growth factors expression in patients with erosive esophagitis . Although the pathogenesis and treatment of erosive esophagitis ( EE ) is well recognized , little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of mucosal healing in EE patients . In this pilot study , we enrolled typical EE patients to evaluate what kinds of growth factors and their receptors were activated in their injured esophageal mucosa . Forty endoscopically proved EE patients were consecutively enrolled . Messenger RNA expressions , which includes keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) and its receptor ( P21802 ) , epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) and its receptor ( HGFR ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 , were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Data were compared between the injured EE mucosa and their normal esophageal mucosa above EE . The mRNA expressions of P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and P35354 , but not P00533 , KGF , P21802 , P09038 , and P23219 , were significantly increased in the injured mucosa of EE patients compared with those of normal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) . The study found that P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and , P35354 are activated in the injured mucosa of EE patients ; their activation might be involved in mucosal repair and ulcer healing of EE . Effect of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of glimepiride in a Korean population . BACKGROUNDS : DB00222 is a commonly used sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent . There is considerable interindividual variation in the response to sulfonylurea for patients with type 2 diabetes . The purpose of this study was to investigate whether genetic variations influence the efficacy of glimepiride in healthy Korean subjects . METHODS : A single 2-mg oral dose of glimepiride was administered to 46 healthy volunteers . Serial blood sampling for 12h after oral dosing was performed for determination of plasma glimepiride , glucose and insulin levels . We tested the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in four candidate genes with the efficacy of glimepiride . RESULTS : Pharmacodynamic profiles for plasma glucose and insulin showed no statistically significant differences among genotype groups , and parameters were not different from one another . There were no association of the Q14654 , O75052 , Q9NQB0 and Q09428 gene polymorphisms and the efficacy of glimepiride . CONCLUSIONS : Knowledge of these polymorphisms provides no clinical useful information for the pharmacogenetic therapeutic approach for Korean patients with type 2 diabetes . Phosphodiesterase inhibitors control A172 human glioblastoma cell death through DB02527 -mediated activation of protein kinase A and Epac1/Rap1 pathways . AIMS : We investigated whether DB02527 -mediated protein kinase A(PKA) and Epac1/Rap1 pathways differentially affect brain tumor cell death using 4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidone(rolipram) , specific phosphodiesterase type IV ( PDE IV ) inhibitor . MAIN METHODS : A172 and U87MG human glioblastoma cells were used . Percentage of cell survival was determined by MTT assay . PKA and Epac1/Rap1 activation was determined by western blotting and pull-down assay , respectively . Cell cycle and hypodiploid cell formation were assessed by flow cytometry analysis . KEY FINDINGS : Non-specific PDE inhibitors , isobutylmethylxanthine( DB07954 ) and theophylline reduce survival percentage of A172 and U87MG cells . The expression of P27815 and Q07343 was detected in A172 and U87MG cells . DB01954 -treated A172 or U87MG cell survival was lower in the presence of forskolin , adenylate cyclase activator , than that in its absence . Co-treatment with rolipram and forskolin also enhanced CREB phosphorylation on serine 133 that was inhibited by H-89 , PKA inhibitor and DB02527 -responsive guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1(Epac1) , a Rap GDP exchange factor-mediated Rap1 activity in A172 cells . When A172 cells were treated with cell-permeable dibutyryl- DB02527 (dbcAMP) , PKA activator or 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate(CPT) , Epac1 activator , basal level of cell death was increased and cell cycle was arrested at the phase of G2/M . DB01954 -induced A172 cell death was also increased by the co-treatment with dbcAMP or CPT , but it was inhibited by the pre-treatment with H-89 . SIGNIFICANCE : These findings demonstrate that PKA and Epac1/Rap1 pathways could cooperatively play a role in rolipram-induced brain tumor cell death . It suggests that rolipram might regulate glioblastoma cell density through dual pathways of PKA- and Epac1/Rap1-mediated cell death and cell cycle arrest . Bcr-Abl activates O14965 and Q96GD4 in chronic myeloid leukemia cells via AKT signaling . This study explored molecular mechanisms by which Bcr-Abl induced expression of O14965 and B ( O14965 and Q96GD4 ) in chronic myeloid leukemia cells . Lentiviral transduction of Bcr-Abl into either Ba/ P13726 or P28906 (+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells potently increased levels of O14965 and Q96GD4 in association with phosphorylation of AKT and stimulated their proliferation . Bcr-Abl-mediated expression of O14965 and Q96GD4 were decreased in P28906 (+) HSPCs when AKT was inactivated by an shRNA against AKT , suggesting that Bcr-Abl induced expression of O14965 and Q96GD4 via AKT signaling . DB05220 , an inhibitor of O14965 , significantly inhibited the proliferation of freshly isolated P28906 (+) CML cells in a dose-dependent manner as measured by colony forming assay . Importantly , inhibition of O14965 in P28906 (+) leukemia cells freshly isolated from individuals with blast crisis of CML with Bcr-Abl T315I mutant ( n = 2 ) by DB05220 significantly impaired the engraftment of these cells in severely immunocompromised mice and decreased the weight of spleens . Taken together , Bcr-Abl induces expression of O14965 and Q96GD4 at least in part via AKT . Inhibition of O14965 could be useful to overcome imatinib-resistance mediated by Bcr-Abl mutants . P48061 and [N33A] P48061 in 5637 and HeLa cells : regulating P00533 phosphorylation via calmodulin/calcineurin . In the human neoplastic cell lines 5637 and HeLa , recombinant P48061 elicited , as expected , downstream signals via both G-protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent pathways responsible for inducing a rapid and a late wave , respectively , of P27361 /2 phosphorylation . In contrast , the structural variant [N33A] P48061 triggered no β-arrestin-dependent phosphorylation of P27361 /2 , and signaled via G protein-dependent pathways alone . Both P48061 and [N33A] P48061 , however , generated signals that transinhibited P00533 phosphorylation via intracellular pathways . 1 ) Prestimulation of P61073 / P00533 -positive 5637 or HeLa cells with P48061 modified the HB- P01133 -dependent activation of P00533 by delaying the peak phosphorylation of tyrosine 1068 or 1173 . 2 ) Prestimulation with the synthetic variant [N33A] P48061 , while preserving P61073 -related chemotaxis and P61073 internalization , abolished P00533 phosphorylation . 3 ) In cells knockdown of β-arrestin 2 , P48061 induced a full inhibition of P00533 like [N33A] P48061 in non-silenced cells . 4 ) P00533 phosphorylation was restored as usual by inhibiting PCK , calmodulin or calcineurin , whereas the inhibition of CaMKII had no discernable effect . We conclude that both recombinant P48061 and its structural variant [N33A] P48061 may transinhibit P00533 via G-proteins/calmodulin/calcineurin , but [N33A] P48061 does not activate β-arrestin-dependent P27361 /2 phosphorylation and retains a stronger inhibitory effect . Therefore , we demonstrated that P48061 may influence the magnitude and the persistence of signaling downstream of P00533 in turn involved in the proliferative potential of numerous epithelial cancer . In addition , we recognized that [N33A] P48061 activates preferentially G-protein-dependent pathways and is an inhibitor of P00533 . DB01184 treatment for gastroparesis : demographic and pharmacogenetic characterization of clinical efficacy and side-effects . BACKGROUND : DB01184 is a useful alternative to metoclopramide for treatment of gastroparesis due to better tolerability . Effectiveness and side-effects from domperidone may be influenced by patient-related factors including polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes , drug transporters , and domperidone targets . AIMS : The aim of this study was to determine if demographic and pharmacogenetic parameters of patients receiving domperidone are associated with response to treatment or side-effects . METHODS : Patients treated with domperidone for gastroparesis provided saliva samples from which DNA was extracted . Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in seven candidate genes ( P08183 , P10635 , P14416 , P15382 , Q9Y6J6 , Q12809 , P51787 ) were used for genotyping . SNP microarrays were used to assess single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ADRA1A , P35368 , and P25100 loci . RESULTS : Forty-eight patients treated with domperidone participated in the study . DNA was successfully obtained from each patient . Age was associated with effectiveness of domperidone ( p=0.0088 ) . Genetic polymorphism in Q12809 was associated with effectiveness of domperidone ( p=0.041 ) . The efficacious dose was associated with polymorphism in P08183 gene ( p=0.0277 ) . The side-effects of domperidone were significantly associated with the SNPs in the promoter region of P25100 gene . CONCLUSIONS : Genetic characteristics associated with response to domperidone therapy included polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene P08183 , the potassium channel Q12809 gene , and α1D -- adrenoceptor P25100 gene . Age was associated with a beneficial response to domperidone . If verified in a larger population , this information might be used to help determine which patients with gastroparesis might respond to domperidone and avoid treatment in those who might develop side-effects . Post-translational and cell type-specific regulation of P61073 expression by cytokines . We have investigated the regulation and function of the chemokine receptor P61073 on neutrophils . P61073 is hardly detectable on neutrophils in the peripheral blood . However , overnight culture strongly up-regulates P61073 expression on the cell surface . The functional activity of P61073 on cultured neutrophils was confirmed by stromal cell-derived factor ( SDF ) -induced migration and up-regulation of the integrins CD11b and CD11c . P61073 surface expression on neutrophils but not on lymphocytes and monocytes is rapidly down-regulated after stimulation with P01375 and P01579 , resulting in significantly decreased SDF-induced functional responses of neutrophils . In contrast to surface expression , P61073 mRNA expression was several-fold increased in cytokine-stimulated neutrophils , suggesting a post-translational regulation . By confocal microscopy we demonstrate that P61073 is internalized after stimulation with P01375 and P01579 . Tauhe down-modulation of P61073 surface expression in response to P01375 and P01579 was fully reversible after cytokine removal . Further , P61073 down-modulation could be completely blocked by hypertonic sucrose and significantly reduced by chlorpromazine indicating the involvement of clathrin-coated pits . Internalization of P61073 by cytokines in a cell type-specific manner is a novel and functionally important mechanism of chemokine receptor regulation .
Q03181 is up-regulated during vascular lesion formation and promotes post-confluent cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells . Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) delta is widely expressed in many tissues , the role of PPARdelta is poorly understood . In this study , we report that PPARdelta was up-regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) during vascular lesion formation . By using Northern blot analysis , we demonstrated that PPARdelta was increased by 3-4-fold in VSMC treated with platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( 20 ng/ml ) . In addition , PDGF-induced PPARdelta mRNA expression neither needs de novo protein synthesis nor affects the stability of PPARdelta mRNA in VSMC . Preincubation of VSMC with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor ( LY294002 , 50 micromol/liter ) or infection of VSMC with an adenovirus carrying the gene for a dominant negative form of Akt abrogated PDGF-induced PPARdelta mRNA expression , suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of PDGF-induced PPARdelta mRNA expression in VSMC . To explore the role of PPARdelta in VSMC , we generated rat vascular smooth muscle cells ( A7r5 ) stably overexpressing PPARdelta and the control green fluorescent protein . Overexpression of PPARdelta in VSMC increased post-confluent cell proliferation by increasing the cyclin A and P24941 as well as decreasing p57(kip2) . Taken together , the results suggest that PPARdelta plays an important role in the pathology of diseases associated with VSMC proliferation , such as primary atherosclerosis and restenosis . DB01393 restores the inhibition of DB00094 -induced follicular development and steroidogenesis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma pathway in an in vitro mouse preantral follicle culture . We recently reported that bezafibrate , a lipid-lowering drug of the fibrate class , administered in addition to clomiphene citrate ( CC ) successfully induced ovulation in CC-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) patients . We hypothesized that bezafibrate may directly affect ovarian follicle development . P01308 resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are important for the pathogenesis of PCOS . In this study , we first examined the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , which plays a role in insulin resistance , on follicle development by using the follicle culture system . P01375 significantly inhibited follicle-stimulating hormone ( DB00094 ) -induced follicle development , 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) secretion , and ovulation rate in a dose-dependent manner . We then examined whether bezafibrate treatment could rescue the inhibition of DB00094 -induced follicle development and steroidogenesis by P01375 . DB01393 treatment rescued inhibition of follicle development , secretion of E2 , and ovulation rate by P01375 . We examined the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) subtypes in mouse preantral follicles . As the protein expression of only P37231 was observed in mouse preantral follicles , we examined whether bezafibrate could affect follicle development and steroidogenesis through P37231 pathways . Treatment with GW1929 , a selective P37231 agonist , restored inhibition of DB00094 -induced follicle development and steroidogenesis by P01375 , whereas treatment with GW9662 , a selective P37231 antagonist , canceled the restorative effects of bezafibrate . Collectively , the results in this study suggest that bezafibrate may directly exhibit a restorative effect on the inhibition of ovarian follicle development and steroidogenesis by P01375 through the P37231 pathway . P06401 level as a predictor of response to megestrol acetate in advanced breast cancer : a retrospective study . DB00351 ( 160 mg/day ) produced a response rate of 44 % in a retrospective series of 39 evaluable patients with advanced breast cancer . The estrogen-receptor ( ER ) level was greater than 10 fmols/mg of protein in 28 patients , and the progesterone-receptor ( PR ) level was greater than 10 fmols/mg of protein in 26 patients . ER and PR levels , age , and disease-free interval were analyzed for their relationship to response . The PR was the single best predictor of response to megestrol acetate ; the addition of ER added 2 % to the predictive accuracy rate of PR alone . P62937 -deficient mice are resistant to immunosuppression by cyclosporine . DB00091 is an immunosuppressive drug that is widely used to prevent organ transplant rejection . Known intracellular ligands for cyclosporine include the cyclophilins , a large family of phylogenetically conserved proteins that potentially regulate protein folding in cells . Immunosuppression by cyclosporine is thought to result from the formation of a drug-cyclophilin complex that binds to and inhibits calcineurin , a serine/threonine phosphatase that is activated by TCR engagement . Amino acids within the cyclophilins that are critical for binding to cyclosporine have been identified . Most of these residues are highly conserved within the 15 mammalian cyclophilins , suggesting that many are potential targets for the drug . We examined the effects of cyclosporine on immune cells and mice lacking Ppia , the gene encoding the prototypical cyclophilin protein cyclophilin A . TCR-induced proliferation and signal transduction by Ppia(-/-) P01730 (+) T cells were resistant to cyclosporine , an effect that was attributable to diminished calcineurin inhibition . Immunosuppressive doses of cyclosporine failed to block the responses of Ppia(-/-) mice to allogeneic challenge . Rag2(-/-) mice reconstituted with Ppia(-/-) splenocytes were also cyclosporine resistant , indicating that this property is intrinsic to Ppia(-/-) immune cells . Thus , among multiple potential ligands , CypA is the primary mediator of immunosuppression by cyclosporine . The glial cell modulator and phosphodiesterase inhibitor , DB05066 ( ibudilast ) , attenuates prime- and stress-induced methamphetamine relapse . Stress and renewed contact with drug ( a " slip " ) have been linked to persisting relapse of methamphetamine abuse . Human brain microglial activation has been linked with methamphetamine abuse , and inhibitors of glial cell activation , certain phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) inhibitors , and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor ( P39905 ) have been reported to modulate drug abuse effects . Our objective was to determine whether the glial cell attenuator , 3-isobutyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo-[1,5-a]pyridine ( DB05066 , ibudilast ) , a non-selective PDE inhibitor and promoter of P39905 , could reduce stress- and methamphetamine prime-induced reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking behavior . Male Long-Evans hooded rats were trained to lever press reinforced with 0.1 mg/kg i.v. methamphetamine infusion according to fixed-ratio 1 ( FR1 ) reinforcement schedules during daily , 2-hour experimental sessions . After performance had stabilized , lever pressing was extinguished for 12 consecutive sessions and doses of 0 ( vehicle ) , 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg DB05066 were then administered intraperitoneally b.i.d. on the last 2 days of extinction and then once on the testday to separate groups of 12 rats . During testing , the rats were given 15 min of intermittent footshock or a 1 mg/kg i.p. methamphetamine prime followed by a 2-hour reinstatement test session . DB05066 significantly reduced response levels of footshock-induced ( 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg ) and prime-induced ( 7.5 mg/kg ) reinstatement of extinguished methamphetamine-maintained responding . DB05066 has properties consistent with the ability to attenuate relapse precipitated by stress and methamphetamine " slips " during abstinence . These results thus reinforce interest in atypical neurobiological mechanisms which could be exploited for developing novel medications for treating drug abuse disorders . Anti-allergic function and regulatory mechanisms of KR62980 in allergen-induced airway inflammation . The ligand-activated transcription factor , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 )gamma , and its ligands inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production by immune cells , thus exerting anti-inflammatory activity . As a non-thiazolidinedione PPARgamma ligand , KR62980 has anti-diabetic and anti-adipogenic activities , but its anti-inflammatory function has yet to be characterized . In this study , we investigated the functions and mechanisms of KR62980 in the activation and differentiation of P01730 + T helper ( Th ) cells by comparing its effects with those of a thiazolidinedione PPARgamma ligand , rosiglitazone . KR62980 dose-dependently and significantly suppressed TCR-triggered Th cell proliferation by suppressing P60568 /IL-2Ralpha-mediated signaling . Both KR62980 and rosiglitazone suppressed IFNgamma production in a dose-dependent manner , whereas P05112 gene expression was specifically suppressed by only KR62980 . In addition , sustained KR62980 treatment diminished Th2 cytokine production by inhibiting c-Maf expression . In vivo administration of KR62980 in a model of allergic asthma significantly attenuated eotaxin-induced eosinophil infiltration , allergic cytokine production and collagen deposition in the lung . KR62980 also decreased goblet cell hyperplasia in the airway and mucous cell metaplasia in nasal epithelium , concurrent with decreases of allergic Th2 cytokines and Q16552 in the draining lymph node . In conclusion , a novel PPARgamma ligand , KR62980 , suppresses in vitro Th2 cell differentiation and attenuates in vivo OVA-induced airway inflammation , suggesting a beneficial role for KR62980 in the treatment of allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis . Effects of Q07869 agonists on proliferation and differentiation in human urothelium . Systemic treatment of rats with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) agonists ( mainly of dual alpha/gamma activity ) has indicated that they may invoke non-genotoxic carcinogenesis in the epithelial lining of the urinary tract ( urothelium ) . Although there is evidence in the male rat to support an indirect effect via a crystaluria-induced urothelial damage response , there is other evidence to indicate a direct signalling effect on the urothelium and hence the full implication for using these drugs in man is unclear . Numerous reports have demonstrated that PPARs are expressed within the urothelium of different species , including man , and from an early developmental stage . We have developed methods to maintain normal human urothelial ( NHU ) cells in culture , where the cells retain Q07869 expression and express a highly proliferative phenotype , mediated via autocrine stimulation of the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) receptor . We have shown that specific activation of PPARgamma results in a programme of gene expression changes associated with late/terminal cytodifferentiation , including induction of cytokeratins CK13 and CK20 , tight junction-associated claudin 3 , and uroplakins UPK1a and O00526 , but this is dependent upon inhibition of the signalling cascade downstream of the P01133 receptor . This indicates a subtle balance in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation in urothelium , with PPARgamma agonists promoting differentiation . Our data indicate that human urothelium is a target tissue for PPARgamma signalling , but it has yet to be determined whether dual agonists could have a modulatory effect on the proliferation/differentiation balance . Blocking cannabinoid P21554 receptors for the treatment of nicotine dependence : insights from pre-clinical and clinical studies . Tobacco use is one of the leading preventable causes of death in developed countries . Since existing medications are only partially effective in treating tobacco smokers , there is a great need for improved medications for smoking cessation . It has been recently proposed that cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonists represent a new class of therapeutic agents for drug dependence , and notably , nicotine dependence . Here , we will review current evidence supporting the use of this class of drugs for smoking cessation treatment . Pre-clinical studies indicate that nicotine exposure produces changes in endocannabinoid content in the brain . In experimental animals , N-piperidinyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)- DB01213 -3-carboxamide ( rimonabant , SR141716 ) and N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide ( AM251 ) , two cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonists , block nicotine self-administration behavior , an effect that may be related to the blockade of the dopamine-releasing effects of nicotine in the brain . DB06155 also seems efficacious in decreasing the influence of nicotine-associated stimuli over behavior , suggesting that it may act on two distinct neuronal pathways , those implicated in drug-taking behavior and those involved in relapse phenomena . The utility of rimonabant has been evaluated in several clinical trials . It seems that rimonabant is an efficacious treatment for smoking cessation , although its efficacy does not exceed that of nicotine-replacement therapy and its use may be limited by emotional side effects ( nausea , anxiety and depression , mostly ) . DB06155 also appears to decrease relapse rates in smokers . These findings indicate significant , but limited , utility of rimonabant for smoking cessation . Coadministrating luteolin minimizes the side effects of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole . P11511 inhibitors ( AIs ) have been used as adjuvant therapeutic agents for breast cancer . Their adverse side effect on blood lipid is well documented . Some natural compounds have been shown to be potential AIs . In the present study , we compared the efficacy of the flavonoid luteolin to the clinically approved AI letrozole ( DB01006 ; Novartis Pharmaceuticals , East Hanover , NJ ) in a cell and a mouse model . In the in vitro experimental results for aromatase inhibition , the Ki values of luteolin and letrozole were estimated to be 2.44 µM and 0.41 nM , respectively . Both letrozole and luteolin appeared to be competitive inhibitors . Subsequently , an animal model was used for the comparison . P11511 -expressing MCF-7 cells were transplanted into ovariectomized athymic mice . Luteolin was given by mouth at 5 , 20 , and 50 mg/kg , whereas letrozole was administered by intravenous injection . Similar to letrozole , luteolin administration reduced plasma estrogen concentrations and suppressed the xenograft proliferation . The regulation of cell cycle and apoptotic proteins-such as a decrease in the expression of Bcl-xL , cyclin-A/D1/E , P24941 /4 , and increase in that of Bax-was about the same in both treatments . The most significant disparity was on blood lipids . In contrast to letrozole , luteolin increased fasting plasma high-density lipoprotein concentrations and produced a desirable blood lipid profile . These results suggested that the flavonoid could be a coadjuvant therapeutic agent without impairing the action of AIs . 25-Hydroxycholesterol is not a ligand for the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 ( Q13285 ) . The orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 ( Q13285 ) is involved in the transcriptional regulation of all the steroid hydroxylase genes , and also regulates the transcription of the genes for Müllerian Inhibitory substance ( P03971 ) , alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormone , LHbeta , oxytocin , P30968 , Q01718 , prolactin receptor , DAX-1 , and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein . Other members of the nuclear receptor gene family , including steroid hormone , thyroid hormone , retinoic acid , Q07869 , and vitamin D receptors must bind ligand to activate transcription , but Q13285 has been considered to be an orphan nuclear receptor because , when identified , it had no known ligand . A recent publication suggested that transcriptional regulation by Q13285 , expressed in a non-steroidogenic CV-1 cells , could be activated by oxysterols suggesting that these compounds could serve as natural ligands for Q13285 . We now demonstrate that 25-hydroxycholesterol , either added exogenously or synthesized endogenously in steroidogenic mouse Leydig MA-10 cells , did not act as a ligand for Q13285 , as it did not increase transcription from six different Q13285 -dependent DNA sequences . Furthermore , the abundance of these oxysterols in MA-10 cells was much less than concentrations needed for activation of Q13285 in CV-1 cells , indicating that Q13285 is not constitutively bound by ligand in MA-10 cells . Thus , in steroidogenic cells , transcriptional regulation of the steroid hydroxylase genes by Q13285 does not depend upon the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol , and is not modified by its presence . P60568 suppression by 2-arachidonyl glycerol is mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma independently of cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 . 2-Arachidonyl glycerol ( 2-AG ) is an endogenous arachidonic acid derivative that binds cannabinoid receptors P21554 and CB2 and is hence termed an endocannabinoid . 2-AG also modulates a variety of immunological responses , including expression of the autocrine/paracrine T cell growth factor interleukin ( IL ) -2 . The objective of the present studies was to determine the mechanism responsible for P60568 suppression by 2-AG . Because of the labile properties of 2-AG , 2-AG ether , a nonhydrolyzable analog of 2-AG , was also used . Both 2-AG and 2-AG ether suppressed P60568 expression independently of P21554 and CB2 , as demonstrated in leukocytes derived from P21554 /CB2-null mice . Moreover , we demonstrated that both 2-AG and 2-AG ether treatment activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , as evidenced by forced differentiation of 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells into adipocytes , induction of aP2 mRNA levels , and activation of a PPARgamma-specific luciferase reporter in transiently transfected 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells . Consequently , the putative role of PPARgamma in P60568 suppression by 2-AG and 2-AG ether was examined in Jurkat T cells . Concordant with PPARgamma involvement , the PPARgamma-specific antagonist 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-(4-pyridyl)-benzamide ( T0070907 ) blocked 2-AG- and 2-AG ether-mediated P60568 suppression . Likewise , 2-AG suppressed the transcriptional activity of two transcription factors crucial for P60568 expression , nuclear factor of activated T cells and nuclear factor kappaB , in the absence but not in the presence of T0070907 . 2-AG treatment also induced PPARgamma binding to a Q07869 response element in activated Jurkat T cells . Together , the aforementioned studies identify PPARgamma as a novel intracellular target of 2-AG , which mediates the suppression of P60568 by 2-AG in a manner that is independent of P21554 and/or CB2 . Traditional Korean Herbal Formula Samsoeum Attenuates Adipogenesis by Regulating the Phosphorylation of P27361 /2 in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 Cells . Adipogenesis is the cell differentiation process from preadipocytes into adipocytes and the critical action in the development of obesity . In the present study , we conducted in vitro analyses to investigate the inhibitory effects of Samsoeum ( SSE ) , a traditional herbal decoction . SSE had no significant cytotoxic effect against either the undifferentiated or differentiated 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells . Oil Red O staining results showed that SSE significantly inhibited fat accumulation in adipocytes . SSE treatment consistently reduced the intracellular triglyceride content in the cells . SSE significantly inactivated glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GPDH ) , a major link between carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes , and markedly inhibited the production of leptin , an important adipokine , in differentiated cells . SSE markedly suppressed the mRNA expression of the adipogenesis-related genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( Q07869 -γ ) , CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha ( C/EBP-α ) , fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , lipoprotein lipase ( P06858 ) , and fatty acid binding protein 4 ( P15090 ) . Importantly , SSE increased the phosphorylation of P27361 /2 , but not p38 MAPK and JNK , in adipose cells . Overall , our results indicate that SSE exerts antiadipogenic activity and modulates expressions of adipogenesis-related genes and P27361 /2 activation in adipocytes . Gender difference in the activity but not expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in human lung adenocarcinoma cells . The higher frequency of lung adenocarcinoma in women smokers than in men smokers suggests a role for gender-dependent factors in the etiology of lung cancer . We evaluated estrogen receptor ( ER ) alpha and beta expression and activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and normal lung fibroblasts . Q8N1N2 -length ERalpha and ERbeta proteins were expressed in all cell lines with higher ERbeta than ERalpha . Although estradiol ( E(2) ) binding was similar , E(2) stimulated proliferation only in cells from females , and this response was inhibited by anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( DB04468 ) and DB00947 . In contrast , E(2) did not stimulate replication of lung adenocarcinoma cells from males and DB04468 or ICI did not block cell proliferation . Similarly , transcription of an estrogen response element-driven reporter gene was stimulated by E(2) in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females , but not males . P06401 ( PR ) expression was increased by E(2) in two out of five adenocarcinoma cell lines from females , but none from males . E(2) decreased P12830 protein expression in some of the cell lines from females , as it did in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , but not in the cell lines from males . Thus , ERalpha and ERbeta expression does not correlate with the effect of ER ligands on cellular activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells . On the other hand , coactivator Q15648 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females versus males and higher in adenocarcinoma cells than in normal human bronchial epithelial cells . Q15648 and other ER coregulators may contribute to differences in estrogen responsiveness between lung adenocarcinoma cells in females and males . DB00644 antagonist in the management of prostate cancer . DB00044 -releasing hormone ( P01148 ) agonist therapy to induce medical castration has become the most common form of hormonal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer . When treatment is started , P01148 agonists initially stimulate the release of LH , causing a surge in serum testosterone that can precipitate a " flare " phenomenon or worsening of disease , particularly in patients with bone metastatic disease . DB00644 ( DB00644 ) receptor antagonism represents a newer approach to medical castration . DB00106 is a pure P30968 antagonist that is devoid of any P01148 agonist activity . Results from 1 phase II and 3 phase III clinical trials demonstrate that abarelix produces medical castration more quickly and without causing testosterone surge , as compared with P01148 agonists with or without a nonsteroidal antagonist . The safety profile in terms of adverse events is comparable between the 2 types of treatment , but the lack of testosterone surge with abarelix might confer a safety advantage by abolishing the risk of a disease flare . Effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands , bezafibrate and fenofibrate , on adiponectin level . OBJECTIVE : Q15848 is adipose-specific secretory protein and acts as anti-diabetic and anti-atherosclerotic molecule . We previously found peroxisome proliferators response element in adiponectin promoter region , suggesting that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) ligands elevate adiponectin . Fibrates are known to be PPARalpha ligands and were shown to reduce risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease . Effect of fibrates on adiponectin has not been clarified , whereas thiazolidinediones enhance adiponectin . Thus , we explored the possibility and mechanism that fibrates enhance adiponectin in humans , mice , and cells . METHODS AND RESULTS : Significant increase of serum adiponectin was observed in bezafibrate-treated subjects compared with placebo group in patients enrolled in The DB01393 Infarction Prevention study . Higher baseline adiponectin levels were strongly associated with reduced risk of new diabetes . Fibrates , bezafibrate and fenofibrate , significantly elevated adiponectin levels in wild-type mice and 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . Such an effect was not observed in PPARalpha-deficient mice and adipocytes . Fibrates activated adiponectin promoter but failed to enhance its activity when the point mutation occurred in peroxisome proliferators response element site and the endogenous PPARalpha was knocked down by PPARalpha-RNAi . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that fibrates enhance adiponectin partly through adipose PPARalpha and measurement of adiponectin might be a useful tool for searching subjects at high risk for diabetes . Regulation of activating transcription factor-2 in early stage of the adipocyte differentiation program . p38beta mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is required for the differentiation of 3T3- Q9NUQ9 fibroblasts into adipocytes . Activating transcription factor-2 ( P39905 -2 ) is efficiently phosphorylated and activated by p38beta kinase . These findings led us to examine a regulatory role of P39905 -2 in adipocyte differentiation . The induction of P39905 -2 protein precedes the expression of the transcription factors , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) alpha . Consistent with early activation of p38beta kinase , the phosphorylation of P39905 -2 was also detected in early stage of adipocyte differentiation . P39905 -2 regulated gene transcription of PPARgamma , which was synergistically enhanced by p38beta kinase and C/EBPbeta proteins expression . Ectopic expression of P39905 -2 in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells induced the endogenous PPARgamma protein levels . These results suggest that P39905 -2 plays a role in a primary regulator of adipocyte differentiation with C/EBPbeta through promoting adipogenesis-inducing transcription factors including PPARgamma and becomes associated earlier in the differentiation program as mitotic clonal expansion proceeds and the cells become initially differentiated . Pharmacologic activation of mitochondrial biogenesis exerts widespread beneficial effects in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington 's disease . There is substantial evidence that impairment of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -γ-coactivator 1α ( P20142 -1α ) levels and activity play an important role in Huntington 's disease ( HD ) pathogenesis . We tested whether pharmacologic treatment with the pan- Q07869 agonist bezafibrate would correct a deficiency of P20142 -1α and exert beneficial effects in a transgenic mouse model of HD . We found that administration of bezafibrate in the diet restored levels of P20142 -1α , PPARs and downstream genes to levels which occur in wild-type mice . There were significant improvements in phenotype and survival . In the striatum , astrogliosis and neuronal atrophy were attenuated and numbers of mitochondria were increased . DB01393 treatment prevented conversion of type I oxidative to type II glycolytic muscle fibers and increased the numbers of muscle mitochondria . Finally , bezafibrate rescued lipid accumulation and apparent vacuolization of brown adipose tissue in the HD mice . These findings provide strong evidence that treatment with bezafibrate exerts neuroprotective effects which may be beneficial in the treatment of HD . Inhibition of the T790M gatekeeper mutant of the epidermal growth factor receptor by EXEL-7647 . PURPOSE : Agents inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) have shown clinical benefit in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer patients expressing amplified or mutationally activated P00533 . However , responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for P00533 gene mutations that confer resistance to DB00171 competitive P00533 inhibitors , such as erlotinib and gefitinib . We describe here the activity of EXEL-7647 ( DB05007 ) , a novel spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor with potent activity against the P01133 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase families , against both wild-type ( WT ) and mutant P00533 in vitro and in vivo . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The activity of P00533 inhibitors against WT and mutant EGFRs and their effect on downstream signal transduction was examined in cellular assays and in vivo using A431 and MDA-MB-231 ( WT P00533 ) and H1975 ( L858R and T790M mutant P00533 ) xenograft tumors . RESULTS : EXEL-7647 shows potent and long-lived inhibition of the WT P00533 in vivo . In addition , EXEL-7647 inhibits cellular proliferation and P00533 pathway activation in the erlotinib-resistant H1975 cell line that harbors a double mutation ( L858R and T790M ) in the P00533 gene . In vivo efficacy studies show that EXEL-7647 substantially inhibited the growth of H1975 xenograft tumors and reduced both tumor P00533 signaling and tumor vessel density . Additionally , EXEL-7647 , in contrast to erlotinib , substantially inhibited the growth and vascularization of MDA-MB-231 xenografts , a model which is more reliant on signaling through vascular endothelial growth factor receptors . CONCLUSIONS : These studies provide a preclinical basis for clinical trials of DB05007 in solid tumors and in patients bearing tumors that are resistant to existing P00533 -targeted therapies . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma is a target of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs mediating cyclooxygenase-independent inhibition of lung cancer cell growth . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) inhibit the growth of different cancer cell types , suggesting a broad role for their cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) targets and eicosanoid products in tumor cell growth . Sulindac sulfide , a P36551 inhibitor , inhibited the growth of non-small-cell lung cancers ( NSCLC ) both in soft agar and as xenografts in nude mice . Importantly , the concentration of sulindac sulfide required to inhibit NSCLC cell growth greatly exceeded the concentration required to inhibit prostaglandin ( PG ) E(2) synthesis in NSCLC cells , suggesting that NSAID inhibition of cell growth is mediated by additional targets distinct from P36551 . Both sulindac sulfide and ciglitazone , a defined peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) agonist , stimulated a promoter construct containing a Q07869 response element linked to luciferase and potently inhibited NSCLC cell growth at similar concentrations , indicating a role for PPARgamma as a target of NSAID action in these cells . Overexpression of PPARgamma in NSCLC cells strongly inhibited the transformed growth properties of the cells , providing a molecular confirmation of the results obtained with the PPARgamma agonists . Increased expression of PPARgamma , as well as ciglitazone and sulindac sulfide induced expression of P12830 , which has been linked to increased differentiation of NSCLC . Despite the fact that SCLC cell lines expressed little or no cytosolic phospholipase A(2) , P23219 , or P35354 , sulindac sulfide and PPARgamma agonists also inhibited the transformed growth of these lung cancer cells . We propose that PPARgamma serves as a target for NSAIDs that accounts for P36551 -independent inhibition of lung cancer cell growth . Inhibition of functional HER family members increases the sensitivity to docetaxel in human ovarian cancer cell lines . Human epidermal growth factor ( HER ) family-targeted therapy combined with standard cytotoxic agents might improve the treatment of ovarian cancer . Human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 , IGROV-1 , and SKOV-3 with differential P00533 , P04626 , and P21860 expression levels were used to study whether P00533 -directed ( cetuximab ) or P04626 -directed ( trastuzumab , pertuzumab ) monoclonal antibodies inhibited cell growth and abrogated activated receptor signaling routes . Possible increase of antiproliferative effects and further activation of caspase-3 as a read-out for apoptosis were analyzed when monoclonal antibodies were combined with docetaxel . Cetuximab alone inhibited cell growth in OVCAR-3 and IGROV-1 , which was more pronounced when combined with pertuzumab in OVCAR-3 . SKOV-3 cell growth was not significantly affected by any of the antibodies . Cetuximab increased the 50 % growth-inhibiting effects of docetaxel in OVCAR-3 and IGROV-1 , but not in SKOV-3 . Coaddition of pertuzumab to cetuximab plus docetaxel in OVCAR-3 and IGROV-1 , and , to a lesser extent trastuzumab in OVCAR-3 , inhibited cell growth even further . P42574 activation by docetaxel was enhanced after addition of cetuximab in OVCAR-3 and after addition of cetuximab plus pertuzumab in IGROV-1 and SKOV-3 . Functional P00533 -signaling , P04626 -signaling , and P21860 -signaling routes as shown from abrogation of P01133 -stimulated and heregulin-stimulated phosphorylated P27361 /2 by cetuximab , trastuzumab , and pertuzumab , respectively , were shown in OVCAR-3 and IGROV-1 , but hardly in SKOV-3 . DB06366 was able to abrogate phosphorylated P04626 by P01133 and heregulin , except in SKOV-3 . In conclusion , a combination of docetaxel with inhibitors of HER family members , such as cetuximab plus pertuzumab , may be considered for a clinical trial in ovarian carcinomas with functional receptors . Novel phenolic antioxidants as multifunctional inhibitors of inducible P19320 expression for use in atherosclerosis . A series of novel phenolic compounds has been discovered as potent inhibitors of P01375 -inducible expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P19320 ) with concurrent antioxidant and lipid-modulating properties . Optimization of these multifunctional agents led to the identification of 3a ( DB05399 ) as a clinical candidate with demonstrated efficacies in animal models of atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia .
Protein-repairing methionine sulfoxide reductases in photosynthetic organisms : gene organization , reduction mechanisms , and physiological roles . DB00134 oxidation to methionine sulfoxide ( MetSO ) is reversed by two types of methionine sulfoxide reductases ( MSRs ) , A and B , specific to the S- and R-diastereomers of MetSO , respectively . Q9UBK8 genes are found in most organisms from bacteria to human . In the current review , we first compare the organization of the Q9UBK8 gene families in photosynthetic organisms from cyanobacteria to higher plants . The analysis reveals that MSRs constitute complex families in higher plants , bryophytes , and algae compared to cyanobacteria and all non-photosynthetic organisms . We also perform a classification , based on gene number and structure , position of redox-active cysteines and predicted sub-cellular localization . The various catalytic mechanisms and potential physiological electron donors involved in the regeneration of Q9UBK8 activity are then described . Data available from higher plants reveal that MSRs fulfill an essential physiological function during environmental constraints through a role in protein repair and in protection against oxidative damage . Taking into consideration the expression patterns of Q9UBK8 genes in plants and the known roles of these genes in non-photosynthetic cells , other functions of MSRs are discussed during specific developmental stages and ageing in photosynthetic organisms . A transgenic platform for testing drugs intended for reversal of cardiac remodeling identifies a novel 11βHSD1 inhibitor rescuing hypertrophy independently of re-vascularization . RATIONALE : Rescuing adverse myocardial remodeling is an unmet clinical goal and , correspondingly , pharmacological means for its intended reversal are urgently needed . OBJECTIVES : To harness a newly-developed experimental model recapitulating progressive heart failure development for the discovery of new drugs capable of reversing adverse remodeling . METHODS AND RESULTS : A P15692 -based conditional transgenic system was employed in which an induced perfusion deficit and a resultant compromised cardiac function lead to progressive remodeling and eventually heart failure . Ability of candidate drugs administered at sequential remodeling stages to reverse hypertrophy , enlarged LV size and improve cardiac function was monitored . Arguing for clinical relevance of the experimental system , clinically-used drugs operating on the P00797 -Angiotensin- DB04630 -System ( RAAS ) , namely , the P12821 inhibitor Enalapril and the direct renin inhibitor Aliskerin fully reversed remodeling . Remodeling reversal by these drugs was not accompanied by neovascularization and reached a point-of-no-return . Similarly , the PPARγ agonist Pioglitazone was proven capable of reversing all aspects of cardiac remodeling without affecting the vasculature . Extending the arsenal of remodeling-reversing drugs to pathways other than RAAS , a specific inhibitor of 11β-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11β HSD1 ) , a key enzyme required for generating active glucocorticoids , fully rescued myocardial hypertrophy . This was associated with mitigating the hypertrophy-associated gene signature , including reversing the myosin heavy chain isoform switch but in a pattern distinguishable from that associated with neovascularization-induced reversal . CONCLUSIONS : A system was developed suitable for identifying novel remodeling-reversing drugs operating in different pathways and for gaining insights into their mechanisms of action , exemplified here by uncoupling their vascular affects . DB09078 : first global approval . DB09078 ( Lenvima™ ) is a multitargeted receptor kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial-derived growth factor receptors 1 , 2 and 3 , fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , platelet-derived growth factor receptor α , P07949 and P10721 . In addition to their role in normal cellular function , these kinases have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis , tumour growth and cancer progression . DB09078 is being developed by Eisai Co . Ltd for the treatment of solid tumours , primarily for differentiated thyroid cancer , and other malignancies . A capsule formulation of the drug has received approval in the USA for use in locally recurrent or metastatic , progressive , radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer . DB09078 is in pre-registration for this indication in the EU , Australia , Brazil , Canada , Japan , South Korea , Russia , Singapore and Switzerland , and is in phase 3 development in Argentina , Chile and Thailand . DB09078 has orphan designation in the EU and Japan for use in differentiated thyroid cancer . In addition , an ongoing global , phase 3 trial is evaluating the use of lenvatinib as first-line treatment in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . This article summarizes the milestones in the development of lenvatinib leading to this first approval in locally recurrent or metastatic , progressive , radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer . Pivotal role of the P06681 domain of the Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase in substrate selection . The P06681 -WW-HECT-type ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 play a critical role in embryogenesis and adult bone homeostasis via regulation of bone morphogenetic protein , Wnt , and RhoA signaling pathways . The intramolecular interaction between P06681 and HECT domains autoinhibits the ligase activity of Smurf2 . However , the role of the Smurf1 P06681 domain remains elusive . Here , we show that the P06681 -HECT autoinhibition mechanism is not observed in Smurf1 , and instead its P06681 domain functions in substrate selection . The Smurf1 P06681 domain exerts a key role in localization to the plasma membrane and endows Smurf1 with differential activity toward RhoA versus Q99717 and Runx2 . Crystal structure analysis reveals that the Smurf1 P06681 domain possesses a typical anti-parallel β-sandwich fold . Examination of the sulfate-binding site analysis reveals two key lysine residues , Lys-28 and Lys-85 , within the P06681 domain that are important for Smurf1 localization at the plasma membrane , regulation on cell migration , and robust ligase activity toward RhoA , which further supports a Ca(2+)-independent localization mechanism for Smurf1 . These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified role of the Smurf1 P06681 domain in substrate selection and cellular localization . P37268 inhibitors suppress triglyceride biosynthesis through the farnesol pathway in rat hepatocytes . We recently demonstrated that squalene synthase ( P37268 ) inhibitors reduce plasma triglyceride through an P01130 -independent mechanism in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits ( Hiyoshi et al. 2001. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 431 : 345-352 ) . The present study deals with the mechanism of the inhibition of triglyceride biosynthesis by the P37268 inhibitors ER-27856 and RPR-107393 in rat primary cultured hepatocytes . DB01076 , an P04035 inhibitor , had no effect on triglyceride biosynthesis , but reversed the inhibitory effect of the P37268 inhibitors . A squalene epoxidase inhibitor , NB-598 , affected neither triglyceride biosynthesis nor its inhibition by ER-27856 and RPR-107393 . The reduction of triglyceride biosynthesis by ER-27856 and RPR-107393 was potentiated by mevalonolactone supplementation . Treatment of hepatocytes with farnesol and its derivatives reduced triglyceride biosynthesis . In addition , we found that ER-27856 and RPR-107393 significantly reduced the incorporation of [1-(14)C]acetic acid into oleic acid , but not the incorporation of [1-(14)C]oleic acid into triglyceride . Though ER-27856 and RPR-107393 increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation , the inhibition of beta-oxidation by RS-etomoxir had little effect on their inhibition of triglyceride biosynthesis . These results suggest that P37268 inhibitors reduce triglyceride biosynthesis by suppressing fatty acid biosynthesis via an increase in intracellular farnesol and its derivatives . Identification of microRNAs involved in the modulation of pro-angiogenic factors in atherosclerosis by a polyphenol-rich extract from propolis . New vessel formation plays a critical role in the progression and vulnerability of atherosclerotic lesions . It has been shown that polyphenols from propolis attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis and also exert inhibitory effects on angiogenic factors . However , the mechanisms underlying these effects are not completely understood . Thus , this study aimed to identify microRNAs ( miRNAs ) involved in the modulation of pro-angiogenic factors in the atherosclerotic plaques of P01130 gene knockout mice treated with a polyphenol-rich extract of Chilean propolis . The progression of the atherosclerotic lesions was significantly attenuated in treated mice compared with control mice . Using microarray analysis and a bioinformatic approach , we identified 29 differentially expressed miRNAs . Many of these miRNAs were involved in biological processes associated with angiogenesis , such as the cell cycle , cell migration , cell growth and proliferation . Among them , three miRNAs ( miR-181a , miR-106a and miR-20b ) were over-expressed and inversely related to the expression of Vegfa ( vascular endothelial growth factor A ) and Hif1a ( hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha ) . In addition , P15692 protein expression was attenuated in histological sections obtained from the aortic sinuses of treated mice . P15692 is a key pro-angiogenic factor in atherosclerotic plaques , and Hif1a , which is expressed in the necrotic nucleus of the atheroma , is its main inducer . We found a correlation between the over-expression of miR-181a , miR-106a and miR-20b and their target genes , Hif1a and Vegfa , which is consistent with attenuation of the atherosclerotic lesion . In conclusion , our data analysis provides evidence that the anti-angiogenic effects of polyphenols from Chilean propolis can be modulated by miRNAs , in particular miR-181a , miR-106a and miR-20b . Treatment of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes . Our previous studies have shown vascular dysfunction in small coronary and mesenteric arteries in Zucker obese rats , a model of the metabolic syndrome , and Zucker Diabetic Fatty ( ZDF ) rats , a model of type 2 diabetes . Because of their lipid lowering action and antioxidant activity , we predicted that treatment with DB01098 , an P04035 inhibitor ( statin ) or Enalapril , an angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor would improve vascular dysfunction associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes . METHODS : 20-week-old Zucker obese and 16-week-old ZDF rats were treated with DB01098 ( 25 mg/kg/day ) or Enalapril ( 20 mg/kg/day ) for 12 weeks . We examined metabolic parameters , indices of oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in ventricular and mesenteric small arteries ( 75-175 microm intraluminal diameter ) from lean , Zucker obese and ZDF rats ( untreated and treated ) . RESULTS : Endothelial dependent responses were attenuated in coronary vessels from Zucker obese and ZDF rats compared to responses from lean rats . Both drugs improved metabolic parameters , oxidative stress , and vascular dysfunction in Zucker obese rats , however , only partial improvement was observed in ZDF rats , suggesting more aggressive treatment is needed when hyperglycemia is involved . CONCLUSION : Vascular dysfunction is improved when Zucker obese and , to a lesser degree , when ZDF rats were treated with DB01098 or Enalapril . Efficacy and safety of repeated dosing of netupitant , a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist , in treating overactive bladder . AIM : NK-1 receptors in sensory nerves , the spinal cord and bladder smooth muscle participate in complex sensory mechanisms that regulate bladder activity . This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a new P25103 antagonist , netupitant , in patients with OAB . METHODS : This was a phase II , multicenter , double-blind study in which adults with OAB symptoms > 6 months were randomized to receive 1 of 3 doses of netupitant ( 50 , 100 , 200 mg ) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks . The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in average number of daily micturitions at week 8 . Urinary incontinence , urge urinary incontinence ( UUI ) , and urgency episodes were also assessed . RESULTS : The primary efficacy endpoint was similar in the treatment groups ( -13.85 for placebo to -16.17 in the netupitant 200 mg group ) with no statistically significant differences between netupitant and placebo . The same was true for most secondary endpoints although a significant difference for improvement in UUI episodes and a trend for the greatest decrease in urgency episodes were seen in the netupitant 100 mg group . DB09048 was well tolerated with most treatment emergent adverse events ( AEs ) being mild . While the overall incidence of AEs increased with netupitant dose , there was no evidence for this dose dependency based on relationship to treatment , intensity , or time to onset . CONCLUSIONS : The study failed to demonstrate superiority of netupitant versus placebo in decreasing OAB symptoms , despite a trend favoring netupitant 100 mg . There were no safety concerns with daily administration of netupitant over 8 weeks . Gene expression studies provide clues to the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma : new evidence and a systematic review . BACKGROUND : Uterine leiomyomas are extremely common and a major cause of pelvic pain , bleeding , infertility , and the leading indication for hysterectomy . Familial and epidemiological studies provide compelling evidence that genetic alterations play an important role in leiomyoma development . METHODS : Using Affymetrix U133A GeneChip we analysed expression profiles of 22,283 genes in paired samples of leiomyoma and adjacent normal myometrium . We compared our results with previously published data on gene expression in uterine leiomyoma and identified the overlapping gene alterations . RESULTS : We detected 80 genes with average differences of > or = 2-fold and false discovery rates of < 5 % ( 14 overexpressed and 66 underexpressed ) . A comparative analysis including eight previous gene expression studies revealed eight prominent genes ( P07327 , P18847 , P29373 , O00622 , Q07507 , P42262 , P01344 , Q5EB52 ) identified by at least five different studies , eleven genes ( P00352 , P25063 , P29279 , O43602 , P28562 , P01100 , O60829 , P24592 , P41222 , P43115 , P04818 ) reported by four studies , twelve genes ( ABCA , P04083 , Q15847 , O00585 , P38936 , Q14194 , P54849 , P03372 , FY , Q99683 , P37173 , P35625 ) identified by three studies , and 40 genes reported by two different studies . CONCLUSIONS : Review of gene expression data revealed concordant changes in genes regulating retinoid synthesis , IGF metabolism , TGF-beta signaling and extracellular matrix formation . Gene expression studies provide clues to the relevant pathways of leiomyoma development . DB05294 improves anti-tumor effects of L19mTNFalpha in xenograft models of esophageal cancer . PURPOSE : Targeting the tumor vasculature by vascular disrupting agents ( VDAs ) has shown therapeutic activity in mouse models . In most cases , however , VDA efficacy is substantially compromised by the inability of these drugs to completely kill tumor cells located at the periphery of the tumor mass . In this study , we investigated anti-tumor effects of L19mTNFα , a fusion protein composed of Q9Y2K2 ( scFv ) , specific for the angiogenesis-associated ED-B containing fibronectin isoform , and murine TNFα , in xenograft models of esophageal cancer . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We evaluated ED-B expression in esophageal cancer samples . Subsequently , we generated subcutaneous xenografts from primary tumors , treated them with the L19mTNFα scFv , and determined effects on tumor vasculature , viability and proliferation , and P15692 expression and infiltration by hematopoietic cells . To overcome tumor resistance , L19mTNFα scFv was combined with vandetanib , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of P15692 receptor , epidermal growth factor receptor , and P07949 signaling . RESULTS : ED-B was broadly expressed by esophageal cancer cell lines , as well as xenografts and primary surgical samples of esophageal cancer . Administration of L19mTNFα acutely damaged tumor vasculature and increased necrosis , indicating a VDA-like activity of this immunoconjugate . This event was followed , however , by rapid tumor growth recovery associated with increased expression of P15692 and recruitment of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells into tumors . Combination of L19mTNFα with vandetanib severely impaired vascular functions in tumors , leading to a reduction of cell proliferation and increased necrosis , without apparent signs of toxicity . CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that a combination of vascular damaging agents with anti-angiogenic drugs could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for esophageal cancer . Integrin αvβ3 and P16070 pathways in metastatic prostate cancer cells support osteoclastogenesis via a Runx2/Smad 5/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand signaling axis . BACKGROUND : Bone loss and pathological fractures are common skeletal complications associated with androgen deprivation therapy and bone metastases in prostate cancer patients . We have previously demonstrated that prostate cancer cells secrete receptor activator of NF-kB ligand ( O14788 ) , a protein essential for osteoclast differentiation and activation . However , the mechanism(s) by which O14788 is produced remains to be determined . The objective of this study is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling O14788 expression in metastatic prostate cancer cells . RESULTS : We show here that phosphorylation of Smad 5 by integrin αvβ3 and Q13950 by P16070 signaling , respectively , regulates O14788 expression in human-derived PC3 prostate cancer cells isolated from bone metastasis . We found that Q13950 intranuclear targeting is mediated by phosphorylation of Smad 5 . Indeed , Q99717 knock-down via RNA interference and inhibition of Smad 5 phosphorylation by an αv inhibitor reduced Q13950 nuclear localization and O14788 expression . Similarly , knockdown of P16070 or Q13950 attenuated the expression of O14788 . As a result , conditioned media from these cells failed to support osteoclast differentiation in vitro . Immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarray sections containing primary prostatic tumor ( grade2-4 ) detected predominant localization of Q13950 and phosphorylated Smad 5 in the nuclei . Immunoblotting analyses of nuclear lysates from prostate tumor tissue corroborate these observations . CONCLUSIONS : Collectively , we show that P16070 signaling regulates phosphorylation of Q13950 . Localization of Q13950 in the nucleus requires phosphorylation of Smad-5 by integrin αvβ3 signaling . Our results suggest possible integration of two different pathways in the expression of O14788 . These observations imply a novel mechanistic insight into the role of these proteins in bone loss associated with bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer . DB09210 defines a new binding site for allosteric modulators of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid ( AMPA ) receptors . Glutamate receptors are the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the vertebrate central nervous system and are important potential drug targets for cognitive enhancement and the treatment of schizophrenia . Allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors promote dimerization by binding to a dimer interface and reducing desensitization and deactivation . The pyrrolidine allosteric modulators , piracetam and aniracetam , were among the first of this class of drugs to be discovered . We have determined the structure of the ligand binding domain of the AMPA receptor subtypes P42262 and P42263 with piracetam and a corresponding structure of P42263 with aniracetam . Both drugs bind to P42262 and P42263 in a very similar manner , suggesting little subunit specificity . However , the binding sites for piracetam and aniracetam differ considerably . DB04599 binds to a symmetrical site at the center of the dimer interface . DB09210 binds to multiple sites along the dimer interface with low occupation , one of which is a unique binding site for potential allosteric modulators . This new site may be of importance in the design of new allosteric regulators . O95760 augments DB05875 -induced P15692 secretion from human mast cells and is increased in psoriatic skin . The peptide DB05875 ( SP ) has been implicated in inflammatory conditions , such as psoriasis , where mast cells and P15692 are increased . A relationship between SP and P15692 has not been well studied , nor has any interaction with the proinflammatory cytokines , especially O95760 . Here we report that SP ( 0.1-10 microM ) induces gene expression and secretion of P15692 from human LAD2 mast cells and human umbilical core blood-derived cultured mast cells ( hCBMCs ) . This effect is significantly increased by coadministration of O95760 ( 5-100 ng/mL ) in both cell types . The effect of SP on P15692 release is inhibited by treatment with the P25103 antagonist 733,060 . SP rapidly increases cytosolic calcium , and so does O95760 to a smaller extent ; the addition of O95760 augments the calcium increase . SP-induced P15692 production involves calcium-dependent PKC isoforms , as well as the P29323 and JNK MAPKs . Gene expression of O95760 and histidine decarboxylase ( HDC ) , an indicator of mast cell presence/activation , is significantly increased in affected and unaffected ( at least 15 cm away from the lesion ) psoriatic skin , as compared with normal control skin . Immunohistochemistry indicates that O95760 is associated with endothelial cells in both the unaffected and affected sites , but is stronger and also associated with immune cells in the affected site . These results imply that functional interactions among SP , O95760 , and mast cells leading to P15692 release contribute to inflammatory conditions , such as the psoriasis , a nonallergic hyperproliferative skin inflammatory disorder with a neurogenic component . DB00898 dose-dependently elicits opposing regulatory effects on hippocampal AMPA receptor P42262 subunits through a zeta inhibitory peptide-sensitive kinase in adolescent and adult Sprague-Dawley rats . AMPA receptor P42262 subunits are strongly implicated in cognition , and prior work suggests that these subunits may be regulated by atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) isoforms . The present study assessed whether hippocampal and cortical AMPA receptor P42262 subunit regulation may be an underlying factor in known age-related differences to cognitive-impairing doses of ethanol , and if aPKC isoforms modulate such responses . Hippocampal AMPA receptor P42262 subunit , protein kinase Mζ ( PKMζ ) , and PKCι/λ expression were elevated during adolescence compared to adults . 1 h following a low-dose ( 1.0-g/kg ) ethanol exposure , hippocampal AMPA receptor P42262 subunit serine 880 phosphorylation was decreased in adolescents , but was increased in adults . Age-dependent changes in P42262 subunit phosphorylation were paralleled by alterations in aPKC isoforms , and zeta inhibitory peptide ( Q8N5A5 ) administration prevented ethanol-induced increases in both in adults . DB00898 -induced changes in P42262 subunit phosphorylation were associated with delayed regulation in synaptosomal P42262 subunit expression 24 h later . A higher ethanol dose ( 3.5-g/kg ) failed to elicit changes in most measures in the hippocampus at either age . Similar to the hippocampus , analysis of cerebral cortical tissue also revealed age-related declines . However , no demonstrable effects were found following a low-dose ethanol exposure at either age . High-dose ethanol exposure reduced adolescent P42262 subunit phosphorylation and aPKC isoform expression that were again accompanied by delayed reductions in synaptosomal P42262 subunit expression . Together , these results suggest that P42262 -containing AMPA receptor modulation by aPKC isoforms is age- , region- and dose-dependently regulated , and may potentially be involved in developmentally regulated ethanol-induced cognitive impairment and other ethanol behaviors . P10997 -driven metabolic reprogramming induces regression of p53-deficient tumours in vivo . P04637 is commonly altered in human cancer , and Tp53 reactivation suppresses tumours in vivo in mice ( P04637 and Tp53 are also known as p53 ) . This strategy has proven difficult to implement therapeutically , and here we examine an alternative strategy by manipulating the p53 family members , Tp63 and Tp73 ( also known as p63 and p73 , respectively ) . The acidic transactivation-domain-bearing ( TA ) isoforms of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53 , whereas the ΔN isoforms ( lacking the acidic transactivation domain ) of p63 and p73 are frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in a dominant-negative fashion against p53 , TAp63 and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour-suppressive functions . The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that promote tumour suppression , such as apoptosis and autophagy , thus a clear understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with alterations in the p53 pathway . Here we show that deletion of the ΔN isoforms of p63 or p73 leads to metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53-deficient tumours through upregulation of P10997 , the gene that encodes amylin , a 37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin by the β cells of the pancreas . We found that P10997 is causally involved in this tumour regression and that amylin functions through the calcitonin receptor ( CalcR ) and receptor activity modifying protein 3 ( O60896 ) to inhibit glycolysis and induce reactive oxygen species and apoptosis . DB01278 , a synthetic analogue of amylin that is currently used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes , caused rapid tumour regression in p53-deficient thymic lymphomas , representing a novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers . Crystallization and preliminary X-ray studies of ferric uptake regulator from Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense . Magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria have been widely used in studies of magnetic domains and in commercial applications . The iron content of magnetotactic bacteria is ∼100 times higher than that of Escherichia coli . Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense Q9UBK8 -1 can still take up iron even at high intracellular concentrations . Ferric uptake regulator ( Fur ) is a global iron-responsive regulator that affects magnetosome formation , iron transport and oxygen metabolism . However , the mechanism of iron uptake and homeostasis by M. gryphiswaldense Q9UBK8 -1 Fur is not clear . Here , the expression , purification and crystallization of apo and SeMet Fur from M. gryphiswaldense Q9UBK8 -1 are reported . The crystals belonged to space group P06681 . Matthews coefficient analysis and size-exclusion chromatography showed that the asymmetric unit probably contains one dimer of Fur . Diffraction data were optimized to 1.58 Å resolution for apo Fur and to 1.9 Å resolution for SeMet Fur . DB11582 suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by O14788 and cancer cells through inhibition of inflammatory pathways : a new use for an old drug . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Most patients with cancer die not because of the tumour in the primary site , but because it has spread to other sites . Common tumours , such as breast , multiple myeloma , and prostate tumours , frequently metastasize to the bone . To search for an inhibitor of cancer-induced bone loss , we investigated the effect of thiocolchicoside , a semi-synthetic colchicoside derived from the plant Gloriosa superba and clinically used as a muscle relaxant , on osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand ( O14788 ) and tumour cells . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : We used RAW 264.7 ( murine macrophage ) cells , a well-established system for osteoclastogenesis , and evaluated the effect of thiocolchicoside on O14788 -induced NF-κB signalling and osteoclastogenesis as well as on osteoclastogenesis induced by tumour cells . KEY RESULTS : DB11582 suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by O14788 , and by breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells . Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway was responsible for this effect since the colchicoside inhibited O14788 -induced NF-κB activation , activation of IκB kinase ( IKK ) and suppressed inhibitor of NF-κBα ( IκBα ) phosphorylation and degradation , an inhibitor of NF-κB . Furthermore , an inhibitor of the IκBα kinase γ or NF-κB essential modulator , the regulatory component of the IKK complex , demonstrated that the NF-κB signalling pathway is mandatory for osteoclastogenesis induced by O14788 . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : Together , these data suggest that thiocolchicoside significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by O14788 and tumour cells via the NF-κB signalling pathway . Thus , thiocolchicoside , a drug that has been used for almost half a century to treat muscle pain , may also be considered as a new treatment for bone loss . The bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway is upregulated in a mouse model of total parenteral nutrition . Total parenteral nutrition ( O15533 ) results in intestinal mucosal atrophic changes due to an absence of enteral nutrition ; however , the mechanisms responsible for this are not fully understood . It has been shown that bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) activation inhibits intestinal epithelial cell ( EC ) proliferation . Therefore , we hypothesized that the BMP pathway could be upregulated by O15533 . To address this , we randomly assigned mice to receive O15533 or to be enterally fed ( control ) for 7 d . Mucosal EC isolates were harvested from the entire length of small intestine for RNA and protein measurements . Q8N1N2 -thickness , mid-small bowel was processed for histological examination . O15533 increased the abundance of P12643 , P12644 , and Q13873 at the RNA and protein levels . Phosphorylation of Q15797 , Q99717 , and Smad8 also was greater in the O15533 group than in the control , which helped to confirm activation of this pathway . Interestingly , the O15533 and control groups did not differ in the mRNA expression of the extracellular soluble bmp antagonists , noggin , gremlin , chordin , or follistatin . Compared to the control group , the expression of c-Myc ( cellular myelocytomatosis ) mRNA was lower , whereas the level of P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) was greater , in the O15533 group . Because the BMP family may function through suppression of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling , this pathway was also examined . mRNA expression of Wnt 3 , Wnt5a , and the Wnt receptor Lrp5 were lower in the O15533 group compared to controls . The results suggest that the BMP signaling pathway may be involved in the development of intestinal mucosal atrophy due to O15533 administration . P04637 mutation , epithelial-mesenchymal transition , and stemlike features in breast cancer subtypes . Altered p53 protein is prevalently associated with the pathologic class of triple-negative breast cancers and loss of p53 function has recently been linked to the induction of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and acquisition of stemness properties . We explored the association between P04637 mutational status and expression of some genes involved in the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway ( the most potent EMT inducer ) and in two early EMT associated events : loss of cell polarity and acquisition of stemness-associated features . We used a publicly accessible microarray dataset consisting of 251 p53-sequenced primary breast cancers . Statistical analysis indicated that mutant p53 tumors ( especially those harboring a severe mutation ) were consistent with the aggressive class of triple-negative cancers and that , differently from cell cultures , surgical tumors underexpressed some TGF-β related transcription factors known as involved in EMT ( P41134 , P47928 , P84022 , Q13485 , Q99717 , P37275 ) . These unexpected findings suggest an interesting relationship between p53 mutation , mammary cell dedifferentiation , and the concomitant acquisition of stemlike properties ( as indicated by the overexpression of O43490 and P46531 genes ) , which improve tumor cells aggressiveness as indicated by the overexpression of genes associated with cell proliferation ( P11802 , Q00534 , P46013 ) and migration ( P61073 , P03956 ) . Targeting eIF4GI translation initiation factor affords an attractive therapeutic strategy in multiple myeloma . BACKGROUND : Deregulation of protein synthesis is integral to the malignant phenotype and translation initiation is the rate limiting stage . Therefore , eIF4F translation initiation complex components are attractive therapeutic targets . METHODS : Protein lysates of myeloma cells ( cell lines/patients ' bone marrow samples ) untreated/treated with bevacizumab were assayed for eIF4GI expression , regulation ( P15559 /proteosome dependent fragmentation ) ( WB , DB00266 , qPCR ) and targets (WB). eIF4GI was inhibited by knockdown and 4EGI-1 . Cells were tested for viability ( ELISA ) , death ( FACS ) and eIF4GI targets ( WB ) . RESULTS : Previously , we have shown that manipulation of P15692 in myeloma cells attenuated P06730 dependent translation initiation . Here we assessed the significance of eIF4GI to MM cells . We demonstrated increased expression of eIF4GI in myeloma cells and its attenuation upon P15692 inhibition attributed to elevated P15559 /proteasome dependent fragmentation and diminished mRNA levels . Knockdown of eIF4GI was deleterious to myeloma cells phenotype and expression of specific molecular targets ( Q99717 /ERα/HIF1α/c-Myc ) . Finally , we showed that the small molecule 4EGI-1 inhibits eIF4GI and causes a reduction in expression of its molecular targets in myeloma . CONCLUSION : Our findings substantiate that translation initiation of particular targets in MM is contingent on the function of eIF4GI , critical to cell phenotype , and mark it as a viable target for pharmacological intervention .
Inhibition of HIV-associated reverse transcriptase by sugar-modified derivatives of thymidine 5'-triphosphate in comparison to cellular DNA polymerases alpha and beta . The sugar-modified dTTP analogues 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-thymidine 5'-triphosphate ( ddeTTP ) , 2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate ( ddTTP ) , 3'-fluorothymidine 5'-triphosphate ( FdTTP ) , and 3'-azidothymidine 5'-triphosphate ( N3dTTP ) are demonstrated to be very effective and selective inhibitors of the HIV-associated reverse transcriptase ( HIV-RT ) . This conclusion is based on a comparison of the ID50 values of the compounds for the HIV-RT ( ranging from 0.03 microM for ddeTTP to 0.1 microM for ddTTP ) and the cellular DNA polymerase alpha ( greater than 200 microM ) . P06746 is partially affected by N3dTTP ( ID50 = 31 microM ) and by the other analogues ( ID50 = 1-2.2 microM ) . FdTTP has proved as effective as N3dTTP ( ID50 = 0.05 microM ) in suppressing the HIV-RT activity . Kinetic analysis revealed for both dTTP analogues a competitive type of inhibition and the same P04264 values ( about 0.05 microM ) . Agonist-induced glycogenolysis in rabbit retinal slices and cultures . 1. The effects of different putative retinal transmitters and/or modulators on glycogenolysis in rabbit retinal slices and in retinal Müller cell cultures were examined . 2 . Incubation of rabbit retinal slices or primary retinal cultures ( either 3-5 day-old or 25-30 day-old ) in a buffer solution containing [ 3H ] -glucose resulted in the accumulation of newly synthesized [ 3H ] -glycogen . 3 . DB00368 ( NA ) , isoprenaline , vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) , 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) and 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminetetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) stimulated the hydrolysis of this newly formed 3H-polymer . The potency order of maximal stimulations was : P01282 greater than NA greater than isoprenaline greater than 5-HT greater than 8-OH-DPAT . 4 . The putative retinal transmitters , dopamine , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glycine and taurine and the muscarinic agonist carbachol ( CCh ) had no effect on [ 3H ] -glycogen content . 5 . The glycogenolytic effects of NA/isoprenaline and 5-HT/8-OH-DPAT appear to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and 5-HT1 receptors ( possibly P08908 ) , respectively while the P01282 -induced response involved another receptor subtype . 6 . Agonists which mediated [ 3H ] -glycogen hydrolysis also stimulated an increase in adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate ( cyclic AMP ) formation . Both responses are blocked to a similar extent by the same antagonists and so are probably mediated via the same receptor subtypes . Moreover , dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( db cyclic AMP ) promoted tritiated glycogen breakdown in the three retinal preparations . 7 . Not all receptors linked to cyclic AMP production however promote glycogenolysis . Dopamine and apomorphine stimulated cyclic AMP formation via D1-receptors without influencing glycogenolysis . These receptors are exclusively associated with neurones . DB09068 ( Lu AA21004 ) , a novel multimodal antidepressant , enhances memory in rats . The serotonergic system plays an important role in cognitive functions via various 5-HT receptors . DB09068 ( Lu AA21004 ) in development as a novel multimodal antidepressant is a 5- Q9H205 , P34969 and P28221 receptor antagonist , a P28222 receptor partial agonist , a P08908 receptor agonist and a 5-HT transporter ( 5-HTT ) inhibitor in vitro . Preclinical studies suggest that 5- Q9H205 and P34969 receptor antagonism as well as P08908 receptor agonism may have a positive impact on cognitive functions including memory . Thus vortioxetine may potentially enhance memory . We investigated preclinical effects of vortioxetine ( 1-10mg/kg administered subcutaneously [ s.c. ] ) on memory in behavioral tests , and on cortical neurotransmitter levels considered important in rat memory function . Contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition tests were applied to assess memory in rats . Microdialysis studies were conducted to measure extracellular neurotransmitter levels in the rat medial prefrontal cortex . DB09068 administered 1h before or immediately after acquisition of contextual fear conditioning led to an increase in freezing time during the retention test . This mnemonic effect was not related to changes in pain sensitivity as measured in the hotplate test . Rats treated with vortioxetine 1h before training spent more time exploring the novel object in the novel object recognition test . In microdialysis studies of the rat medial prefrontal cortex , vortioxetine increased extracellular levels of acetylcholine and histamine . In conclusion , vortioxetine enhanced contextual and episodic memory in rat behavioral models . Further demonstration of its potential effect on memory functions in clinical settings is warranted . Pharmacologic suppression of hepatic O95477 activity in mice reduces high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but promotes reverse cholesterol transport . BACKGROUND : The role of hepatic O95477 ( O95477 ) in maintaining plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) levels is well established , but its role in reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) is unclear . DB01599 is a compound that reduces HDL-C levels but also reduces atherosclerosis in animal models and xanthomas in humans . The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that probucol inhibits hepatic O95477 activity , thereby reducing HDL-C levels but promoting RCT from macrophages . METHODS AND RESULTS : Wild-type ( WT ) C57BL/6 mice and scavenger receptor class B type I ( Q8WTV0 ) knockout mice were fed a chow diet containing 0.5 % probucol or normal chow for 2 weeks . In WT mice , probucol , despite decreasing HDL-C by > 80 % , effectively maintained macrophage RCT . In Q8WTV0 knockout mice , probucol also substantially reduced HDL-C but significantly increased macrophage RCT . Furthermore , probucol significantly enhanced the excretion of HDL-derived cholesterol into feces in both WT and Q8WTV0 knockout mice . DB01599 inhibited O95477 -dependent cholesterol efflux from mouse primary hepatocytes , and this effect was shown to be responsible for the effect of probucol on increasing the fecal excretion of HDL-derived cholesterol in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of hepatic O95477 activity with probucol reduced HDL-C levels but promoted RCT through diversion of HDL-derived cholesterol from efflux back into plasma instead to excretion in the bile . These results explain the beneficial effects of probucol on atherosclerosis and xanthomas despite its HDL-lowering effects and suggest that inactivation of hepatic O95477 leads to increased RCT despite reducing plasma HDL-C levels . Serotonin : a local regulator in the mammary gland epithelium . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) is a very simple molecule that plays key roles in complex communication mechanisms within the animal body . In the mammary glands , serotonin biosynthesis and secretion are induced in response to dilation of the alveolar spaces . Since its discovery several years ago , mammary 5-HT has been demonstrated to perform two homeostatic functions . First , serotonin regulates lactation and initiates the transition into the earliest phases of involution . Second , serotonin is a local signal that induces parathyroid hormone-related peptide ( P12272 ) , which allows the mammary gland to drive the mobilization of calcium from the skeleton . These processes use different receptor types , P34969 and 5-HT2 , respectively . In this review , we provide synthetic perspectives on the fundamental processes of lactation homeostasis and the adaptation of calcium homeostasis for lactation . We analyze the role of the intrinsic serotonin system in the physiological regulation of the mammary glands . We also consider the importance of the mammary serotonin system in pathologies and therapies associated with lactation and breast cancer . Design and synthesis of 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles as potent inhibitors of phosphodiesterase4b2 . A series of 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles has been prepared and evaluated for phosphodiesterase inhibition ( PDE4B2 ) . Among the prepared 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles , compound 9a is the most potent inhibitor ( PDE4B2 IC(50) = 5.28 μm ) . Structure-activity relationship studies of 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles revealed that substituents 3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl group at 3-position and cyclic ring bearing heteroatoms at 5-position are important for activity . Molecular modeling study of the 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles with Q07343 has shown similar interactions of 3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl group ; however , heteroatom ring is slightly deviating when compared to DB01791 . 3-(3-Cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-5-(piperidin-4-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole ( 9a ) exhibited good analgesic and antiinflammatory activities in formalin-induced pain in mice and carrageenan-induced paw edema model in rat . Functional methionine synthase deficiency ( cblE and cblG ) : clinical and biochemical heterogeneity . Functional methionine synthase deficiency is generally characterized by homocystinuria and hypomethioninemia in the absence of methylmalonic aciduria . Patients are divided into two classes , cblE and cblG , on the basis of complementation analysis . Presentation has usually been in the first 2 years of life , but one patient came to medical attention at age 21 years with symptoms initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis . Common findings among 11 patients ( 4 with cblE and 7 with cblG ) have included megaloblastic anemia ( all patients ) and various neurological deficits including developmental retardation ( 10 patients ) , cerebral atrophy ( 8 patients ) , hypotonia ( 7 patients ) , EEG abnormalities ( 6 patients ) , and nystagmus ( 5 patients ) . Hypertonia , seizures , blindness , and ataxia were less frequent . All patients have responded to therapy with cobalamin with resolution of anemia and biochemical abnormalities ; neurological deficits resolved more slowly and in some cases incompletely . DB00200 has been more effective than cyanocobalamin . Fibroblasts from patients with cblE ( 5 patients ) and cblG ( 6 patients ) all showed decreased intracellular levels of methylcobalamin ( DB03614 ) and decreased incorporation of label from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into macromolecules , suggesting decreased activity of the DB03614 -dependent enzyme methionine synthase . Q99707 specific activity in extracts of all cblE fibroblasts was normal or near-normal under standard reducing conditions ; synthase specific activity in extracts of 5 cblG patients was low but was high in a 6th patient measured in another laboratory . Thus , there is heterogeneity among patients with functional methionine synthase deficiency both in clinical presentation and in the results of biochemical studies of cultured cells . Ca2+-calmodulin and janus kinase 2 are required for activation of sodium-proton exchange by the Gi-coupled 5-hydroxytryptamine 1a receptor . The type 1 sodium-proton exchanger ( P19634 ) is expressed ubiquitously and regulates key cellular functions , including mitogenesis , cell volume , and intracellular pH . Despite its importance , the signaling pathways that regulate P19634 remain incompletely defined . In this work , we present evidence that stimulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A ( P08908 ) receptor results in the formation of a signaling complex that includes activated O60674 ( Jak2 ) , Ca2+/calmodulin ( P62158 ) , and P19634 , and which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of P62158 . The signaling pathway also involves rapid agonist-induced association of P62158 and P19634 as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation studies and by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies in living cells . We propose that P19634 is activated through this pathway : P08908 receptor --> G(i2)alpha and/or G(i3)alpha --> Jak2 activation --> tyrosine phosphorylation of P62158 --> increased binding of P62158 to P19634 --> induction of a conformational change in P19634 that unmasks an obscured proton-sensing and/or proton-transporting region of P19634 --> activation of P19634 . The G(i/o)-coupled P08908 receptor now joins a handful of Gq-coupled receptors and hypertonic shock as upstream activators of this emerging pathway . In the course of this work , we have presented clear evidence that P62158 can be activated through tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of a significant role for elevated intracellular Ca2+ . We have also shown for the first time that the association of P62158 with P19634 in living cells is a dynamic process . Identification and characterization of two parathyroid hormone-like molecules in zebrafish . Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) have receptors homologous to the human PTH ( DB05829 ) / P12272 receptor ( Q03431 ) and PTH-2 receptor ( P49190 ) and an additional receptor ( PTH3R ) with high homology to the Q03431 . To find natural ligands for zPTH1R and zPTH3R , we searched the zebrafish genomic database and discovered two distinct regions that , when translated ( zPTH1 and zPTH2 ) , showed high homology to DB05829 . Isolation of cDNAs and determination of the intron/exon boundaries revealed genomic structures which were similar to known PTHs . Peptides consisting of the first 34 amino acids after the pre- and prosequences of the zebrafish PTHs ( zPTHs ) were synthesized and were shown to be fully active at the hPTH1R. zPTH2(1-34) was , however , approximately 30-fold less potent at the zPTH1R than DB05829 (1-34) , hPTHrP(1-36) , and zPTH1(1-34) . When tested with zPTH3R , zPTH1(1-34) and hPTHrP(1-36) showed similar potencies , whereas the potency of zPTH2(1-34) was moderately ( 3-fold ) reduced . To determine whether other fishes have multiple PTHs , we searched the genomic database of the Japanese pufferfish ( Takifugu rubripes ) and identified zPTH1 and zPTH2 homologs . Phylogenetic analysis showed that PTHs from zebrafish and pufferfish are more closely related to each other than to known mammalian PTH homologs or to P12272 and tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues . This is consistent with evolution of two teleost PTH-like peptides occurring after the evolutionary divergence between fishes and mammals . Overall , the PTH system appears more complex in fishes than in mammals , providing evidence of continued evolution in nontetrapod species . The availability of multiple forms of fish PTH and their receptors provide additional tools for PTH ligand/receptor structure-function studies . DB00159 inhibits prostaglandin D2 generation by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase-2 in cultured human mast cells . BACKGROUND : DB00159 ( EPA ) is catalysed by cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) , as is arachidonic acid , and is a competitive inhibitor of arachidonate metabolism . OBJECTIVES : We examined the effect of EPA on prostaglandin ( PG ) D2 generation in the cultured human mast cells with IgE-anti-IgE challenge incubation . METHODS : Cultured human mast cells were incubated with EPA ( 1 micromol/L ) for 20 h , then challenged with anti-IgE incubation after treatment with IgE . At the same time , P36551 inhibitors were tested to identify P23219 and P35354 activity . PGD2 synthetic activity was also assayed in a cell-free homogenate of cultured mast cells with P36551 inhibitors and EPA . DB11320 in the culture medium and in cells was assayed with the HPLC-fluorescent method . PGD2 and PGD3 were assayed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the stable isotope dilution method . RESULTS : Although EPA incubation did not affect histamine release by cultured human mast cells in response to IgE-anti-IgE challenge incubation , it did decrease PGD2 generation by inhibiting the P35354 pathway . In contrast , in the cell-free homogenate of cultured human mast cells , EPA inhibited both P23219 and P35354 activities . CONCLUSION : Pre-incubation with EPA primarily affects the P35354 pathway in cultured human mast cells and reduces PGD2 generation in response to IgE-anti-IgE challenge incubation . These findings suggest that P23219 and P35354 have different substrate flow systems in mast cells . They also suggest that endogenous EPA diet supplementation would reduce PGD2 production and could serve as an anti-inflammatory substrate in human mast cells . Agonist-promoted down-regulation and functional desensitization in two naturally occurring variants of the human serotonin1A receptor . We recently reported two naturally occurring polymorphisms of the human serotonin1A ( P08908 ) receptor : glycine22 --> serine ( Ser22 ) and isoleucine28 --> valine ( Val28 ) in the putative aminoterminal domain of the receptor . To investigate the regulatory properties of these variants , the wild type ( WT ) and variant P08908 receptors were stably expressed in CHO- P04264 cells . WT , Ser22 , and Val28 displayed similar high-affinity binding to [ 3H ] -8-OH-DPAT . Competition experiments with P08908 agonists and antagonists demonstrated similar pharmacological profiles . Receptor agonist-promoted down-regulation was tested by exposure to 100 mumol/L 8-OH-DPAT . After 24-h exposure , WT and Val28 underwent 59.3 +/- 3.9 % and 59.5 +/- 1.4 % reduction in receptor density respectively , whereas the degree of down-regulation was significantly lower for Ser22 ( 21.4 +/- 4.2 % ) . Cell treatment for 24 h with 100 mumol/L 8-OH-DPAT reduced the 5-HT-induced inhibition of DB02527 accumulation by 24.9 +/- 5.1 % for WT and 16.4 +/- 0.8 % for Val28 , but only by 4.8 +/- 3 % for Ser22 . We conclude that the Ser22 variant is capable of attenuating agonist-mediated receptor down-regulation and desensitization . Sustained muscle expression of dystrophin from a high-capacity adenoviral vector with systemic gene transfer of T cell costimulatory blockade . Adenoviral vector ( Ad ) -mediated gene delivery of normal , full-length dystrophin to skeletal muscle provides a promising strategy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( P11532 ) . However , cellular and humoral immune responses induced by vector gene transfer limit the application of this approach . Blockade of the costimulatory interaction between naïve T cells and antigen-presenting cells has proven to be a successful means to diminish immunity induced by gene transfer . In this study we explore the potential of supplementing dystrophin gene delivery to dystrophin-deficient Dmd mouse skeletal muscle with systemic gene delivery of DB01281 and CD40Ig molecules to effect costimulatory blockade . We found that systemic administration of a high-capacity Ad ( HC-Ad ) vector carrying murine DB01281 ( AdmCTLA4Ig ) either alone or codelivered with an HC-Ad vector carrying murine CD40Ig ( AdmCD40Ig ) provided sustained expression of recombinant full-length murine dystrophin from an HC-Ad vector carrying the dystrophin cDNA ( AdmDys ) . The level of AdmDys vector genomes remained stable in animals cotreated with systemic delivery of vectors carrying molecules to block costimulation . In addition , muscle P01730 (+) and CD8(+) T cell infiltrates and Th1 cytokine production by splenocytes were reduced . The production of neutralizing antibody against Ad vector was significantly inhibited in mice receiving systemic codelivery of both AdmCTLA4Ig and AdmCD40Ig , but not in the mice treated with AdmCTLA4Ig alone . The results suggested that coblockade of both P10747 / P33681 and P29965 / P25942 costimulatory pathways is required for effective inhibition of the Ad vector-induced humoral immune response in Dmd mice , whereas blockade of P10747 / P33681 alone by murine DB01281 would be sufficient for prolonged dystrophin expression in treated muscle . Effects of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine incorporation on elongation of specific DNA sequences by P06746 . DB00987 ( ara-C ) is an effective antileukemic agent which acts as an inhibitor of DNA synthesis . The precise mechanism responsible for this inhibitory effect , however , remains unclear . The present work has examined the effects of the triphosphate derivative , ara- P53007 , on purified P06746 . These studies were performed on M13 phage DNA templates of defined sequence . The results demonstrate that ara-C is incorporated into DNA by P06746 . The results also demonstrate that the incorporated ara-C residue acts as a relative chain terminator . Moreover , the relative chain terminating effects of ara-C are sequence specific . In this regard , DNA strand elongation was progressively slowed at sequences of two , three , and four contiguous sites for cytosine incorporation . We also demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of ara-C are reversed by competition with deoxycytidine-triphosphate for incorporation into the DNA strand . Taken together , these findings are consistent with structural differences of the incorporated arabinosyl moiety which alter reactivity of the 3'-terminus and thereby inhibit chain elongation . These findings also provide new insights regarding the inhibitory effects of ara-C on elongation of specific DNA sequences . DB00819 inhibits stimulated feline liver and gallbladder bicarbonate secretion . Bile acidification is a key factor in preventing calcium carbonate precipitation and gallstone formation . P00918 ( CA II ) , that is inhibited by acetazolamide , plays a role in regulation of the acid-base balance in many tissues . This study examines the effect of acetazolamide on secretin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) -stimulated gallbladder mucosal bicarbonate and acid secretion . Gallbladders in anaesthetized cats were perfused with a bicarbonate buffer bubbled with CO2 in air . In 20 experiments P01282 ( 10 microg kg(-1) h(-1) ) and in 10 experiments secretin ( 4 microg kg(-1) h(-1) ) were infused continuously intravenous ( i.v. ) . Hepatic bile and samples from the buffer before and after perfusion of the gallbladder were collected for calculation of ion and fluid transport . During basal conditions a continuous secretion of H+ by the gallbladder mucosa was seen . Intravenous infusion of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) and secretin caused a secretion of bicarbonate from the gallbladder mucosa ( P < 0.01 ) . This secretion was reduced by intraluminal ( i.l. ) acetazolamide ( P < 0.01 ) . Bile flow was enhanced by infusion of P01282 and secretin ( P < 0.01 ) but this stimulated outflow was not affected by i.v. acetazolamide . The presence of CA II in the gallbladder was demonstrated by immunoblotting . Biliary CA activity has an important function in the regulation of P01282 - and secretin-stimulated bicarbonate secretion across the gallbladder mucosa . Interactions between genetic variants of folate metabolism genes and lifestyle affect plasma homocysteine concentrations in the Boston Puerto Rican population . OBJECTIVE : To investigate genetic and lifestyle factors and their interactions on plasma homocysteine ( Hcy ) concentrations in the Boston Puerto Rican population . DESIGN : Cross-sectional study . Plasma concentrations of Hcy , folate , vitamin B12 and pyridoxal phosphate were measured , and genetic polymorphisms were determined . Data on lifestyle factors were collected in interviews . SETTING : A population survey of health and nutritional measures . SUBJECTS : A total of 994 Puerto Rican men and women residing in the Boston metropolitan area . RESULTS : Smoking status was positively associated with plasma Hcy . Genetic polymorphisms P42898 677C→T , Q04609 1561C→T , Q04609 rs647370 and Q96NT5 928A→G interacted significantly with smoking for Hcy . P42898 1298A→C ( P = 0·040 ) and Q96NT5 928A→G ( P = 0·002 ) displayed significant interactions with alcohol intake in determining plasma Hcy . Subjects with Q96NT5 928GG genotype had significantly higher plasma Hcy concentrations compared with carriers of the A allele ( AA+AG ; P = 0·030 ) among non-drinking subjects . When consuming alcohol , GG subjects had lower plasma Hcy levels compared with AA+AG subjects . Physical activity interacted significantly with Q99707 2756A→G in determining plasma Hcy ( P for interaction = 0·002 ) . Smoking interacted with physical activity for plasma Hcy ( P for interaction = 0·023 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Smoking and drinking were associated plasma Hcy concentrations . Genetic variants involved in folate metabolism further modify the effects of lifestyle on plasma Hcy . The genomic clone P08908 which resembles a beta-adrenergic receptor sequence encodes the P08908 receptor . The recent cloning of the complementary DNAs and/or genes for several receptors linked to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins including the adrenergic receptors ( alpha 1 , alpha 2A , alpha 2B , beta 1 , beta 2 ) , several subtypes of the muscarinic cholinergic receptors , and the visual ' receptor ' rhodopsin has revealed considerable similarity in the primary structure of these proteins . In addition , all of these proteins contain seven putative transmembrane alpha-helices . We have previously described a genomic clone , P08908 , isolated by cross-hybridization at reduced stringency with a full length beta 2-adrenergic receptor probe . This clone contains an intronless gene which , because of its striking sequence resemblance to the adrenergic receptors , is presumed to encode a G-protein-coupled receptor . Previous attempts to identify this putative receptor by expression studies have failed . We now report that the protein product of the genomic clone , Q96NT5 , transiently expressed in monkey kidney cells has all the typical ligand-binding characteristics of the 5-hydroxytryptamine ( P08908 ) receptor . Interaction between endothelial differentiation-related factor-1 and calmodulin in vitro and in vivo . P62158 ( P62158 ) is the principal Ca(2+) receptor protein inside the cell . When activated by Ca(2+) , P62158 binds and activates target proteins , thus altering the metabolism and physiology of the cell . Under basal conditions , calcium-free P62158 binds to other proteins termed P62158 -binding proteins . Recently , we described endothelial differentiation-related factor ( P08476 ) -1 as a protein involved in the repression of endothelial cell differentiation ( Dragoni , I. , Mariotti , M. , Consalez , G. G. , Soria , M. , and Maier , J. A. M. ( 1998 ) J. Biol. Chem. 273 , 31119-31124 ) . Here we report that ( i ) O60869 binds P62158 in vitro and in vivo ; ( ii ) O60869 is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by protein kinase C ; and ( iii ) O60869 - P62158 interaction is modulated by the concentrations of Ca(2+) and by the phosphorylation of O60869 by protein kinase C both in vitro and in vivo . In addition , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cell stimulates the nuclear translocation of O60869 . On the basis of the high homology of O60869 with multiprotein bridging factor-1 , a transcriptional coactivator that binds TATA-binding protein ( P20226 ) , we also demonstrate that O60869 interacts with P20226 in vitro and in human endothelial cells . We hypothesize that O60869 serves two main functions in endothelial cells as follows : ( i ) to bind P62158 in the cytosol at physiologic concentrations of Ca(2+) and ( ii ) to act in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator through its binding to P20226 . Genomic structure and chromosome location of the murine Q01064 phosphodiesterase gene . Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) catalyze the hydrolysis of DB02527 and cGMP , thereby participating in regulation of the intracellular concentrations of these second messengers . The PDE1 family is defined by regulation of activity by calcium and calmodulin . We have cloned and characterized the mouse Q01064 gene , which encodes the 63-kDa calcium/calmodulin-dependent PDE ( P62158 -PDE ) , an isozyme that is expressed in the CNS in the olfactory tract , dentate gyrus , and striatum and may participate in learning , memory , and regulation of phosphorylation of Q9UD71 in dopaminergic neurons . We screened an I-129/SvJ mouse genomic library and identified exons 2-13 of the Q01064 gene that span 8.4 kb of genomic DNA . Exons range from 67 to 205 nucleotides and introns from 91 to 2250 nucleotides in length . Exon 1 was not present in the 3 kb of genomic DNA 5' to exon 2 in our clones . The mouse Q01064 gene shares many similar or identical exon boundaries as well as considerable sequence identity with the rat Q07343 and Q08499 genes and the Drosophila dunce DB02527 -specific PDE gene dnc , suggesting that these genes all arose from a common ancestor . Using fluorescence in situ hybridization , we localized the Q01064 gene to the distal tip of mouse Chromosome ( Chr ) 15 . P62158 interacts with DB00171 binding cassette transporter A1 to protect from calpain-mediated degradation and upregulates high-density lipoprotein generation . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the interaction of DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A1 ( O95477 ) with calmodulin in relation to its calpain-mediated degradation because many calpain substrates bind calmodulin to regulate cellular functions . METHODS AND RESULTS : The activity of O95477 is regulated through proteolysis by calpain . An immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay revealed that O95477 directly binds calmodulin in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner . The cytoplasmic loop of O95477 contains a typical calmodulin binding sequence of 1-5-8-14 motifs ( 1245 to 1257 amino acids ) . The peptide of this region showed binding to calmodulin , and deletion of the 1-5-8-14 motif abolished this interaction . This motif is located near the O95477 Pro- DB00142 - DB00133 - DB00156 sequence , and the presence of calmodulin/Ca(2+) protected the peptides from proteolysis by calpain . The knockdown of calmodulin by a specific small and interfering RNA increased the degradation of O95477 and decreased O95477 protein and apolipoprotein A-I-mediated lipid release . Surprisingly , calmodulin inhibitor W7 increased calmodulin binding to O95477 and protected it from calpain-mediated degradation , consistent with our previous finding that this compound increased apolipoprotein A-I-mediated cell cholesterol release . CONCLUSIONS : P62158 directly binds and stabilizes O95477 in the presence of Ca(2+) and increases the generation of high-density lipoprotein . The role of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and cyclooxygenase pathways in the inhibitory serotonergic response to the pressor effect elicited by sympathetic stimulation in chronic sarpogrelate treated rats . We have demonstrated that the antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors produces an enhancement of serotonergic sympathoinhibitory effect by P28221 and P34969 activation . The aim of this work was to determine mechanisms involved in the 5-hydroxytriptaminergic inhibitory action on the pressor responses elicited by sympathostimulation in pithed rats treated with a 5-HT2 receptor blocker . The blockade of 5-HT2 receptors was induced by orally sarpogrelate treatment ( 30 mg/kg/day ) . Two weeks later , animals were anaesthetized and pithed . A bolus injection of 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one ( ODQ ) ( 10 µg/kg ) , a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor , or indomethacin ( 2mg/kg ) , a non-selective P36551 inhibitor , prior to the infusion of ( 2S ) (+)-5-(1,3,5-trimethylpyrazol-4-yl)-2-(dimethylamino)tetralin , AS-19 ( 5 µg/kg/min ) were not able to abolish its inhibitory action . However , i.v. administration of glibenclamide ( 20mg/kg ) , a blocker of DB00171 -sensitive K(+) channels , completely reversed AS-19 sympathoinhibitory action . The inhibitory effect of 2-[5-[3-(4-methylsulfonylamino)benzyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-1H-indol-3-yl]ethanamine , L-694,247 ( 5 µg/kg/min ) was abolished by indomethacin , whereas pretreatment with ODQ had no effect . DB04743 ( 3mg/kg ) , a P35354 inhibitor , completely reversed the inhibitory action of L-694,247 , whereas 1- [ [ 4,5-bis (4-methoxyphenyl)-2-thiazolyl ] carbonyl ] -4-methylpiperazine hydrochloride ( FR122047 ) ( 3mg/kg ) , a P23219 inhibitor , partially blocked this action . The sympathoinhibition by 5-HT ( 20 µg/kg/min ) could not be elicited after i.v. treatment with indomethacin plus glibenclamide . In conclusion , these results suggest that in chronic sarpogrelate-treated rats , the inhibitory serotonergic effect of the pressor responses induced by electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow via P34969 and P28221 receptor activation is mediated by KATP channel-mediated smooth muscle hyperpolarization and the P36551 pathway , respectively . Early effects of topoisomerase I inhibition on RNA polymerase II along transcribed genes in human cells . We have determined the early effects of camptothecin and alpha-amanitin on genomic DNA-binding sites of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) , TATA-binding protein ( P20226 ) , P11387 ( Top1 ) , and histone components in human transcribed loci by chromatin-immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) . The two agents caused notably different alterations in active chromatin . DB04690 induced a specific reduction of RNAPII density at promoter pause sites and histone modifications suggesting an increased chromatin accessibility . alpha-Amanitin caused an accumulation of RNAPII at transcribed genes , a reduction of P20226 bound to chromatin and a less accessible chromatin structure . Interestingly , RNAPII reduction at promoter pause sites occurred within 5-10min of camptothecin treatment , and was not a response to replication-dependent DNA breaks . ChIP analyses of RNAPII along transcribed genes indicated that RNAPII levels were transiently increased at internal exons , and that camptothecin effects could be fully reversed by DRB , a cdk inhibitor . Top1 was found to be enriched in active chromatin , therefore suggesting that Top1 inhibition at the transcribed template and/or adjacent regulating regions immediately affects RNAPII at active genes . The findings are novel in vivo evidence of camptothecin effects on RNAPII bound to transcribing genomic regions , and are consistent with the hypothesis that Top1 activity can be involved in transcription regulation at the level of promoter clearance . Involvement of 5-HT₇ receptors in vortioxetine 's modulation of circadian rhythms and episodic memory in rodents . Since poor circadian synchrony and cognitive dysfunction have been linked to affective disorders , antidepressants that target key 5-HT ( serotonin ) receptor subtypes involved in circadian rhythm and cognitive regulation may have therapeutic utility . DB09068 is a multimodal antidepressant that inhibits P28221 , 5- Q9H205 , P34969 receptor activity , 5-HT reuptake , and enhances the activity of P08908 and P28222 receptors . In this study , we investigated the effects of vortioxetine on the period length of O15055 ::LUC expression , circadian behavior , and episodic memory , using tissue explants from genetically modified O15055 ::LUC mice , locomotor activity rhythm monitoring , and the object recognition test , respectively . Incubation of tissue explants from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of O15055 ::LUC mice with 0.1 μM vortioxetine increased the period length of O15055 bioluminescence . Monitoring of daily wheel-running activity of Sprague-Dawley rats treated with vortioxetine ( 10 mg/kg , s.c. ) , alone or in combination with the P08908 receptor agonist flesinoxan ( 2.5 mg/kg , s.c. ) or the P34969 receptor antagonist SB269970 ( 30 mg/kg , s.c. ) , just prior to activity onset revealed significant delays in wheel-running behavior . The increase in circadian period length and the phase delay produced by vortioxetine were abolished in the presence of the P34969 receptor partial agonist AS19 . Finally , in the object recognition test , vortioxetine ( 10 mg/kg , i.p. ) increased the time spent exploring the novel object during the retention test and this effect was prevented by AS19 ( 5 mg/kg , i.p. ) . In conclusion , the present study shows that vortioxetine , partly via its P34969 receptor antagonism , induced a significant effect on circadian rhythm and presented promnesic properties in rodents . P08908 receptor activation : short-term effects on the mRNA expression of the P08908 receptor and galanin in the raphe nuclei . Systemic administration of the P08908 receptor agonist 8-OH-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ; 0.3 mg/kg , s.c. ) was used to explore the effects of activation of P08908 receptors on expression of mRNA coding for P08908 receptor , tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) and galanin in the ascending raphe nuclei . 8-OH-DPAT increased the hybridization signal of the P08908 receptor by 105 % in the dorsal raphe nucleus ( P33681 ) 30 min after the injection . No effects were seen at the later time points ( 2-8 h ) . In the median raphe nucleus ( B8 ) and the B9 cell group in the medial lemniscus , 8-OH-DPAT induced a marked decrease in labeling 30 min after injection . At 8 h following 8-OH-DPAT injection , the effect had shifted to an increase in P08908 receptor labeling by 68 % in the B8 area . Importantly 8-OH-DPAT had no significant effects on the expression of mRNA coding for P17752 and galanin . The results suggest an important and differential mechanism for the regulation of P08908 receptor mRNA levels in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei . This regulation may be of importance for the differential control of the activity of the ascending 5-HT neurons , and hence for mood regulation . The results also indicate a dissociation between the effects mediated by P08908 receptor functions and those regulating the coexisting peptide galanin in the dorsal raphe .
DB00013 induces stromal cell-derived factor-1 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells . Both the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and the uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) play important roles with regard to hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) progression and metastasis . Notably , the stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( P48061 ) is an important chemokine involved in HCC pathology . However , the influence of uPA on P48061 expression in human HCC cells remains unknown . We investigated the mechanisms underlying the modulation of P48061 expression through uPA stimulation in human HCC SK-Hep-1 cells . SK-Hep-1 cells stimulation with uPA induced increases in the expression and secretion of P48061 . By using specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA , we have demonstrated that the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathways are critical for uPA-induced P48061 expression . Transcription factor ELISA and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest that uPA increase Sp1- and AP-1-DNA-binding activities in SK-Hep-1 cells . Inhibition of Sp1 and AP-1 activations by specific siRNAs blocked the uPA-induced P48061 promoter activity and expression . The effect of uPA on SK-Hep-1 signaling and P48061 expression is mediated by Q03405 . In summary , our findings serve to elucidate the uPA/ Q03405 downstream signaling , providing new insight into the function of uPA in HCC cells . Ca2+-calmodulin and janus kinase 2 are required for activation of sodium-proton exchange by the Gi-coupled 5-hydroxytryptamine 1a receptor . The type 1 sodium-proton exchanger ( P19634 ) is expressed ubiquitously and regulates key cellular functions , including mitogenesis , cell volume , and intracellular pH . Despite its importance , the signaling pathways that regulate P19634 remain incompletely defined . In this work , we present evidence that stimulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A ( P08908 ) receptor results in the formation of a signaling complex that includes activated O60674 ( Jak2 ) , Ca2+/calmodulin ( P62158 ) , and P19634 , and which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of P62158 . The signaling pathway also involves rapid agonist-induced association of P62158 and P19634 as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation studies and by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies in living cells . We propose that P19634 is activated through this pathway : P08908 receptor --> G(i2)alpha and/or G(i3)alpha --> Jak2 activation --> tyrosine phosphorylation of P62158 --> increased binding of P62158 to P19634 --> induction of a conformational change in P19634 that unmasks an obscured proton-sensing and/or proton-transporting region of P19634 --> activation of P19634 . The G(i/o)-coupled P08908 receptor now joins a handful of Gq-coupled receptors and hypertonic shock as upstream activators of this emerging pathway . In the course of this work , we have presented clear evidence that P62158 can be activated through tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of a significant role for elevated intracellular Ca2+ . We have also shown for the first time that the association of P62158 with P19634 in living cells is a dynamic process . Red meat and poultry , cooking practices , genetic susceptibility and risk of prostate cancer : results from a multiethnic case-control study . Red meat , processed and unprocessed , has been considered a potential prostate cancer ( DB11245 ) risk factor ; epidemiological evidence , however , is inconclusive . An association between meat intake and DB11245 may be due to potent chemical carcinogens that are generated when meats are cooked at high temperatures . We investigated the association between red meat and poultry intake and localized and advanced DB11245 taking into account cooking practices and polymorphisms in enzymes that metabolize carcinogens that accumulate in cooked meats . We analyzed data for 1096 controls , 717 localized and 1140 advanced cases from the California Collaborative Prostate Cancer Study , a multiethnic , population-based case-control study . We examined nutrient density-adjusted intake of red meat and poultry and tested for effect modification by 12 SNPs and 2 copy number variants in 10 carcinogen metabolism genes : P09211 , P35354 , P05177 , P05181 , P07099 , Q16678 , P19224 , NAT2 , P09488 and P30711 . We observed a positive association between risk of advanced DB11245 and high intake of red meat cooked at high temperatures ( trend P = 0.026 ) , cooked by pan-frying ( trend P = 0.035 ) , and cooked until well-done ( trend P = 0.013 ) . An inverse association was observed for baked poultry and advanced DB11245 risk ( trend P = 0.023 ) . A gene-by-diet interaction was observed between an SNP in the P35354 gene and the estimated levels of meat mutagens ( interaction P = 0.008 ) . Our results support a role for carcinogens that accumulate in meats cooked at high temperatures as potential DB11245 risk factors , and may support a role for heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) in DB11245 etiology . Blocking dopamine D2 receptors by haloperidol curtails the beneficial impact of calorie restriction on the metabolic phenotype of high-fat diet induced obese mice . Calorie restriction is the most effective way of expanding life-span and decreasing morbidity . It improves insulin sensitivity and delays the age-related loss of dopamine receptor D(2) ( P14416 ) expression in the brain . Conversely , high-fat feeding is associated with obesity , insulin resistance and a reduced number of P14416 binding sites . We hypothesised that the metabolic benefit of calorie restriction involves the preservation of appropriate P14416 transmission . The food intake of wild-type C57Bl6 male mice was restricted to 60 % of ad lib. intake while they were treated with the P14416 antagonist haloperidol or vehicle using s.c. implanted pellets . Mice with ad lib. access to food receiving vehicle treatment served as controls . All mice received high-fat food throughout the experiment . After 10 weeks , an i.p. glucose tolerance test was performed and , after 12 weeks , a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp . Hypothalamic P14416 binding was also determined after 12 weeks of treatment . Calorie-restricted ( CR ) vehicle mice were glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive compared to ad lib . ( AL ) fed vehicle mice . CR mice treated with haloperidol were slightly heavier than vehicle treated CR mice . DB00502 completely abolished the beneficial impact of calorie restriction on glucose tolerance and partly reduced the insulin sensitivity observed in CR vehicle mice . The metabolic differences between AL and CR vehicle mice were not accompanied by alterations in hypothalamic P14416 binding . In conclusion , blocking P14416 curtails the metabolic effects of calorie restriction . Although this suggests that the dopaminergic system could be involved in the metabolic benefits of calorie restriction , restricting access to high-fat food does not increase ( hypothalamic ) P14416 binding capacity , which argues against this inference . Protective effects of metallothionein on isoniazid and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity in mice . Isoniazid ( DB00951 ) and DB01045 ( RFP ) are widely used in the world for the treatment of tuberculosis , but the hepatotoxicity is a major concern during clinical therapy . Previous studies showed that these drugs induced oxidative stress in liver , and several antioxidants abated this effect . Metallothionein ( MT ) , a member of cysteine-rich protein , has been proposed as a potent antioxidant . This study attempts to determine whether endogenous expression of MT protects against DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatic oxidative stress in mice . Wild type ( MT+/+ ) and MT-null ( MT-/- ) mice were treated intragastrically with DB00951 ( 150 mg/kg ) , RFP ( 300 mg/kg ) , or the combination ( 150 mg/kg DB00951 +300 mg/kg RFP ) for 21 days . The results showed that MT-/- mice were more sensitive than MT+/+ mice to DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatic injuries as evidenced by hepatic histopathological alterations , increased serum Q9NRA2 levels and liver index , and hepatic oxidative stress as evidenced by the increase of MDA production and the change of liver antioxidant status . Furthermore , DB00951 increased the protein expression of hepatic P05181 and DB00951 /RFP ( alone or in combination ) decreased the expression of hepatic P05177 . These findings clearly demonstrate that basal MT provides protection against DB00951 and RFP-induced toxicity in hepatocytes . The P05181 and P05177 were involved in the pathogenesis of DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatotoxicity . DB00013 receptor is necessary for bacterial defense against pneumonia-derived septic melioidosis by facilitating phagocytosis . DB00013 receptor ( urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor [ Q03405 ] , CD87 ) , a P06744 -anchored protein , is considered to play an important role in inflammation and fibrinolysis . The Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is able to survive and replicate within leukocytes and causes melioidosis , an important cause of pneumonia-derived community-acquired sepsis in Southeast Asia . In this study , we investigated the expression and function of Q03405 both in patients with septic melioidosis and in a murine model of experimental melioidosis . Q03405 mRNA and surface expression was increased in patients with septic melioidosis in/on both peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes as well as in the pulmonary compartment during experimental pneumonia-derived melioidosis in mice . Q03405 -deficient mice intranasally infected with B. pseudomallei showed an enhanced growth and dissemination of B. pseudomallei when compared with wild-type mice , corresponding with increased pulmonary and hepatic inflammation . Q03405 knockout mice demonstrated significantly reduced neutrophil migration toward the pulmonary compartment after inoculation with B. pseudomallei . Further in vitro experiments showed that Q03405 -deficient macrophages and granulocytes display a markedly impaired phagocytosis of B. pseudomallei . Additional studies showed that Q03405 deficiency did not influence hemostatic and fibrinolytic responses during severe melioidosis . These data suggest that Q03405 is crucially involved in the host defense against sepsis caused by B. pseudomallei by facilitating the migration of neutrophils toward the primary site of infection and subsequently facilitating the phagocytosis of B. pseudomallei . DB00013 induces proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells : characterization of structural elements required for growth factor function . Ovarian cancer metastasis is associated with an increase in the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor Q03405 . We present evidence that binding of uPA to Q03405 provokes a mitogenic response in the human ovarian cancer cell line OV-MZ-6 in which endogenous uPA production had been significantly reduced by stable uPA ' antisense ' transfection . High molecular weight ( HMW ) uPA , independent of its enzymatic activity , produced an up to 95 % increase in cell number concomitant with 2-fold elevated [3H]thymidine incorporation as did the catalytically inactive but Q03405 binding amino-terminal fragment of uPA , P39905 . uPA-induced cell proliferation was significantly decreased by blocking uPA/ Q03405 interaction by the monoclonal antibody IIIF10 and by soluble Q03405 . The efficiency of the Q03405 binding synthetic peptide cyclo19,31 uPA19-31 to enhance OV-MZ-6 cell growth proved this molecular domain to be the minimal structural determinant for uPA mitogenic activity . Dependence of uPA-provoked cell proliferation on Q03405 was further demonstrated in Raji cells which do not express Q03405 and were thus not induced by uPA . However , upon transfection with full-length Q03405 , Raji cells acquired a significant growth response to HMW uPA and P39905 . Comparison of expression profiles induced by dust mite in airway epithelia reveals a common pathway . BACKGROUND : Airway epithelial cells have shown to be active participants in the defense against pathogens by producing signaling and other regulatory molecules in response to the encounter . METHODS : In previous manuscripts , we have studied the effect of house dust mite ( HDM ) extract on both an epithelial cell-line ( H292 ) and primary nasal epithelial cell . When we compare these responses we conclude that the H292 cells more closely resemble nasal epithelium of healthy controls ( share 107 probe-sets ) than of allergic individuals ( share 17 probe-sets ) . RESULTS : Interestingly , probably because of an absent intraindividual variation between samples , more probe-sets ( 8280 ) change expression significantly in H292 than in either healthy ( 555 ) or allergic ( 401 ) epithelium . CONCLUSIONS : A direct comparison of all the responses in these epithelial cells reveals a core-response to HDM of just 29 genes . These genes ( P78556 , P10145 , P19875 , P09341 , IL-1B , P15514 , P21580 , Q99075 , P35354 , P12643 , P01130 , Q03405 , P00749 , Q00653 , P19838 , P05412 , P18847 , P18146 , O15118 , Q8IUC6 , P29317 , P29279 , P28562 , O43609 , TLR-3 , complement factor P01024 , Q9Y6Y0 , SerpinB3 , and Q9Y617 ) have described links with allergy or inflammation and may even describe the well-established relationship between viral infections and allergic exacerbations or allergy development . DB00741 is a suppressor of apoptosis in bovine corpus luteum . Glucocorticoid ( GC ) acts as a modulator of physiological functions in several organs . In the present study , we examined whether GC suppresses luteolysis in bovine corpus luteum ( CL ) . DB00741 ( an active GC ) reduced the mRNA expression of caspase 8 ( Q14790 ) and caspase 3 ( P42574 ) and reduced the enzymatic activity of P42574 and cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and interferon gamma ( P01579 ) in cultured bovine luteal cells . mRNAs and proteins of GC receptor ( P04150 ) , 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( P28845 ) , and P80365 were expressed in CL throughout the estrous cycle . Moreover , the protein expression and the enzymatic activity of P28845 were high at the early and the midluteal stages compared to the regressed luteal stage . These results suggest that cortisol suppresses P01375 - P01579 -induced apoptosis in vitro by reducing apoptosis signals via Q14790 and P42574 in bovine CL and that the local increase in cortisol production resulting from increased P28845 at the early and midluteal stages helps to maintain CL function by suppressing apoptosis of luteal cells . DB00013 plasminogen activator augments cell proliferation and neointima formation in injured arteries via proteolytic mechanisms . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) has been implicated in the healing responses of injured arteries , but the importance of its various properties that influence smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) proliferation and migration in vivo is unclear . We used three recombinant ( r- ) forms of uPA , which differ markedly in their proteolytic activities and abilities to bind to the uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) , to determine , which property most influences the healing responses of balloon catheter injured rat carotid arteries . After injury , uPA and Q03405 expression increased markedly throughout the period when medial SMCs were rapidly proliferating and migrating to form the neointima . Perivascular application of uPA neutralizing antibodies immediately after injury attenuated the healing response , significantly reducing neointima size and neointimal SMC numbers . Perivascular application of r-uPAwt ( wild type uPA ) or r-uPA/GDF ( r-uPA with multiple mutations in its growth factor-like domain ) doubled the size of the neointima . Four days after injury these two uPAs nearly doubled neointimal and medial SMC numbers in the vessels , and induced greater reductions in lumen size than injury alone . Proteolytically inactive r-uPA/H/Q ( containing glutamine rather than histidine-204 in its catalytic site ) did not affect neointima or lumen size . Also , in contrast to the actions of proteolytically active uPAs , tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) did not affect the rate of neointima development . We conclude that uPA is an important factor regulating the healing responses of balloon catheter injured arteries , and its proteolytic property , which can not be mimicked by tPA , greatly influences SMC proliferation and early neointima formation . Development of peptidomimetic ligands of Pro- DB00149 - DB00145 -NH(2) as allosteric modulators of the dopamine D(2) receptor . A variety of stable , small-molecule peptidomimetic ligands have been developed to elucidate the mechanism by which the neuropeptide Pro- DB00149 - DB00145 -NH(2) ( P00747 ) modulates dopaminergic neurotransmission . Photoaffinity labeling ligands based upon P00747 peptidomimetics have been used to establish that P00747 binds to the P14416 at a site that is different from the orthosteric site , thus making P00747 and its peptidomimetics allosteric modulators of the dopamine receptor . Through the design , synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of conformationally constrained peptidomimetics containing lactam , bicyclic , and spiro-bicyclic scaffolds , support was provided for the hypothesis that the bioactive conformation of P00747 is a type II β-turn . In addition , studies with peptidomimetics designed to mimic either a type VI β-turn or polyproline II helix conformation yielded molecules that were able to modulate dopamine receptors because of their ability to place the carboxamide NH(2) pharmacophore in the same topological space as that seen in the type II β-turn . Extensive studies with the spiro-bicyclic P00747 peptidomimetics also established that both positive and negative modes of modulation were possible for the same series of peptidomimetics simply as a result of minor differences in the stereochemistry about the bridgehead carbon within the scaffold . This information was used to transform existing positive modulators into negative modulators , which demonstrated that small structural changes in the spiro-bicyclic dopamine receptor modulators are capable of causing major changes in the modulatory activity of P00747 peptidomimetics . A human seminoma xenograft model with regional lymph node metastasis . PURPOSE : To establish a seminoma orthotopic model with lymph node metastasis to investigate the factors related to the lymphophilic behavior of seminoma cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Testicular seminoma xenografts were established by the inoculation of small fragments from subcutaneous ( s.c. ) xenografts that had previously been established in severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID ) mice with a supraclavicular lymph node metastasis from a human seminoma . Hematologic dissemination of tumor cells was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification of the human beta-globin gene . Xenograft messenger RNA levels of metastasis-related genes were examined by reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR . RESULTS : Testicular seminoma xenografts grew in 32/32 ( 100 % ) of the inoculated mice , of which 15 mice ( 47 % ) developed macroscopic metastasis to the renal hilar lymph node . Circulating tumor cells and tumor cell shedding in the lung and liver were detectable by PCR assay in 25/32 ( 78 % ) , 32/32 ( 100 % ) , and 27/32 ( 84 % ) mice , respectively , although metastatic foci were not histologically evident in these organs . Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) , membrane-type 3 matrix metalloproteinase ( P51512 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and reduction in expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 ( P05120 ) were demonstrated by RT-PCR assay in the testicular xenografts as compared with the s.c. xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : This model mimics the lymphophilic behavior of seminoma and may help in elucidating the molecular mechanism of tumor spread via the lymphatics . P10275 as a therapeutic target . Androgens function as sex hormone primarily via activation of a single androgen receptor ( AR , or P10275 ) . AR is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as hypogonadism and prostate cancer . AR ligands of different chemical structures and/or pharmacological properties are widely used for these therapeutic applications , and all of the AR ligands currently available for therapy modulate AR function via direct binding to the ligand-binding pocket ( P18428 ) of the receptor . In the past ten years , our understanding of AR structure and molecular mechanism of action has progressed extensively , which has encouraged the rapid development of newer generation of AR ligands , particularly tissue-selective AR ligands . With improved tissue selectivity , future generations of AR ligands are expected to greatly expand the therapeutic applications of this class of drugs . This review will provide an overview of the common therapeutic applications of currently available AR ligands , and discussion of the major challenges as well as novel therapeutic strategies proposed for future drug development . Smad6s regulates plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 through a protein kinase C-beta-dependent up-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) is a serpin class protease inhibitor that plays a central role in the regulation of vascular function and tissue remodeling by modulating thrombosis , inflammation , and the extracellular matrix . A central mediator controlling P05121 is transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) , which induces its expression and promotes fibrosis . We have found that a unique member of the Smad family of signal transduction molecules , Smad6s , modulates the expression of P05121 . Overexpression of Smad6s in endothelial cells increases promoter activity and P05121 secretion , and an antisense to Smad6s suppresses the induction of P05121 by TGF-beta . The effect of Smad6s on the P05121 promoter appeared to be the result of increase binding of the forkhead winged helix factor FoxD1 to a TGF-beta-responsive element . Furthermore , the effect of Smad6s on P05121 up-regulation and on FoxD1 binding was found to result from up-regulation of TGF-beta and could be inhibited by the blocking TGF-beta signaling with O15105 . The ability of Smad6s to regulate the TGF-beta promoter and subsequent P05121 induction was suppressed by a selective protein kinase C-beta ( P05771 ) inhibitor . Consistent with the in vitro data , we found that increased Smad6s in diseased vessels correlated with increased TGF-beta and P05121 levels . Overall , our results demonstrate that the level of Smad6s can alter the level of TGF-beta and the subsequent induction of P05121 via a FoxD1 transcription site . Furthermore , our data suggest that this process , which is up-regulated in diseased vessels , can be modulated by the inhibition of P05771 . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor promotes macrophage infiltration into the vascular wall of ApoE deficient mice . The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) regulates macrophage adhesion and migration by binding directly to matrix proteins and signaling through integrin complexes . In this study , we examined the role of Q03405 on macrophage infiltration into the vascular wall . Stable murine macrophage ( Raw264.7 ) cell lines expressing high levels of human Q03405 , human urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , or both were established using expression vectors driven by the human P34810 promoter . Stimulation with human uPA specifically induced phosphorylation of early response regulated kinase ( P29323 ) in cells expressing human Q03405 but not in sham transfected cells . The human Q03405 expressing Raw264.7 cells showed increased adhesion to both human uPA and vitronectin ( Vn ) . Raw264.7 cells expressing human Q03405 or both human Q03405 and uPA , but not uPA alone , were detected in the aortic wall of ApoE(-/-) mice , and no cells were detected in that of age-matched C57BL/6J mice after intravenous infusion of the cells . Blocking of Mac-1/ P05362 interaction by anti-alphaM antibody ( M1/70 ) significantly reduced the infiltration of huPAR-expressing Raw264.1 cells into aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice . Treatment of C57BL/6J mice with angiotensin II resulted in infiltration of Raw264.7 cells expressing human Q03405 . These data demonstrate that Q03405 plays a key role in promoting macrophage infiltration into the arterial wall of ApoE(-/-) mice . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) in gestational tissues ; Measurements and clinical implications . BACKGROUND : DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) are central molecules for uPA/ Q03405 /plasmin-dependent proteolysis , which is thought to play a significant role in the development of pregnancy , as well as its many complications . OBJECTIVE : To measure the levels of uPA and Q03405 in the placenta and myometrium , as well as in the foetal membranes and amniotic fluid . STUDY DESIGN : The study group consisted of 35 women with normal course of pregnancy , but with complications arising during delivery , which led to Caesarean section . Samples of placenta , myometrium , foetal membranes , amniotic fluid and blood were obtained at the time of operation . Tissue extracts were prepared . Measurements were made by the ELISA method . RESULTS : uPA and Q03405 concentration in gestational tissues , including amniotic fluid , is 100-200 times higher than in plasma . Among tissues , the highest uPA level was found in placenta ( 1.32 +/- 0.48 ng/mg of protein ) , and the highest Q03405 level in foetal membranes ( 3.33 +/- 1.20 ng/mg of protein ) . CONCLUSIONS : uPA and Q03405 are present in all gestational tissues , in some in relatively high concentrations . Our results support the modern clinical hypothesis that fibrinolytic system can participate in mechanisms of such obstetric complications as pre-term pre-mature rupture of foetal membranes and placental abruption . Differential expression of the urokinase receptor in fibroblasts from normal and fibrotic human lungs . Binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) to a specific receptor ( Q03405 ) on human lung fibroblasts enables it to regulate cellular proteolysis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix . Binding studies with radiolabeled uPA indicated that both normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts express the receptor , but cells from fibrotic tissues bound significantly more uPA ( P < 0.001 ) . Phorbol myristate acetate , lipopolysaccharide , transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) increased uPA binding and plasminogen activation at the cell surface , with a greater maximal effect on fibrotic than on normal fibroblasts . Excess unlabeled uPA , specific antibody , or antisense oligonucleotides inhibited uPA binding . Ribonuclease ( RNase ) protection assays showed higher levels of Q03405 messenger ribonuleic acid ( mRNA ) in each of the five fibrotic cell lines than in normal fibroblasts . uPA was mitogenic for normal as well as fibrotic fibroblasts , indicating that receptor binding concurrently localizes cellular proteolytic activity and stimulates mitogenesis . Morphometry and immunohistochemical analysis showed that Q03405 , as well as uPA , was increased in fibroblasts in fibrotic lung tissue . Increased expression of Q03405 by fibrotic lung fibroblasts and enhanced urokinase binding induced by proinflammatory cytokines suggest a novel mechanism by which fibroblast-mediated matrix remodeling and proliferation may be regulated in interstitial lung diseases . Release of mediators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the course of a severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction caused by anti-D . BACKGROUND : In vitro studies suggest that mediators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome are generated in the course of hemolytic transfusion reactions . Evidence for the in vivo significance of these findings is given by the present clinical and laboratory analysis of a severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction ( P10275 ) . CASE REPORT : A 67-year-old patient ( blood group O , D-negative ) with a negative pretransfusion antibody screen received a massive transfusion because of arterial bleeding ( Day 1 ) . The transfusion of group O , D-positive red cell concentrates was unavoidable because of limited supplies . At Day 10 , the patient developed a P10275 with symptoms of septic-toxic syndrome and signs of hemolysis ; he received an exchange transfusion . Serologic markers , as well as proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators , were monitored at the onset of the P10275 and during the exchange transfusion . RESULTS : At Day 10 , the direct antiglobulin test was positive ; anti-D was present , most likely as the result of an anamnestic immune response . Interleukin ( IL ) -1 was not detectable ; all other mediators monitored were elevated : IL-1 receptor antagonist , tumor necrosis factor , P05231 , P10145 , P22301 , neopterin , elastase , C3a-desArg , P02741 , and fibrinogen . Most of the values declined during the exchange transfusion , which was followed by an improvement of the clinical presentation . CONCLUSIONS : Mediators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome were released in the course of a P10275 caused by anti-D . Severe clinical symptoms could be treated successfully by exchange transfusion . Effects of addition of tissue-type plasminogen activator in in vitro fertilization medium on bovine embryo development and quality . P00747 activators/Plasmin system plays pivotal role in regulating reproductive functions of mammals . Here , we examined the effects of modification of in vitro fertilization medium ( IVF medium ) with the addition of tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) , on bovine embryo development and quality , assessed by quantification of expression of various genes related to metabolism , oxidation , implantation and apoptosis . In addition , plasminogen activator activity ( PAA ) and plasminogen activator inhibition ( P05121 ) were measured in the spent media . After conventional IVM , 2016 cumulus-oocyte complexes ( COCs ) were divided into four groups with modified composition of the IVF medium containing t-PA and/or its inhibitor epsilon-aminocaproic acid ( control , t-PA , t-PA+ε-ACA , ε-ACA ) . Presumptive zygotes were cultured for 8 days in synthetic oviductal fluid ( SOF ) medium ; gene expression studies were carried out on morulae and blastocysts . t-PA alone significantly suppressed cleavage and blastocyst formation rates , but this effect was neutralized by the addition of ε-ACA . PAA in the treated group was significantly reduced by ε-ACA , but without total elimination . Significant differences were detected in the expression of genes related to apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest ( Q07812 , Q07817 , Q92831 ) between embryos produced in t-PA-modified media and controls , giving an overall notion that the inferior developmental competence of treated embryos may be attributed to apoptotic phenomena induced by t-PA . In conclusion , it appears that excessive t-PA content in the IVF media , suppresses blastocyst formation rate , possibly due to induction of apoptotic phenomena . DB00013 stimulates human vascular smooth muscle cell migration via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Tyk2 interaction . Janus kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 play an important role in urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) -dependent signaling . We have recently demonstrated that both kinases are associated with the uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) and mediate uPA-induced activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat1 , Stat2 , and Stat4 ) in human vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) . Janus kinases are not only required for Stat activation but may also interfere with other intracellular signaling pathways . Here we report that in VSMC , Tyk2 interacts with a downstream signaling cascade involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 -K ) . We demonstrate that uPA induces P19957 -K activation , which is abolished in VSMC expressing the dominant negative form of Tyk2 . The regulatory subunit p85 of P19957 -K co-immunoprecipitates with Tyk2 but not with Jak1 , Jak2 , or Jak3 , and uPA stimulation increases the P19957 -K activity in Tyk2 immunoprecipitates . Tyk2 directly binds to either of the two Src homology 2(SH2)p85 domains in a uPA-dependent fashion . We provide evidence that the Tyk2-mediated P19957 -K activation in response to uPA is required for VSMC migration . Thus , two unrelated structurally distinct specific inhibitors of P19957 -K , wortmannin and LY294002 , prevent VSMC migration induced by uPA . No migratory effect of uPA was observed in VSMC expressing the dominant negative form of Tyk2 . Our results underscore the versatile function of Tyk2 in uPA-related intracellular signaling and indicate that P19957 -K plays a selective role in the regulation of VSMC migration . The effect of antisense inhibition of urokinase receptor in human squamous cell carcinoma on malignancy . Concomitant expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its surface receptor ( Q03405 ) has been shown to correlate strongly with a more invasive tumor cell phenotype . A highly malignant human epidermoid carcinoma cell line ( HEp3 ) was transfected with a vector capable of expressing an antisense transcript complementary to 300 bases of the 5' end of Q03405 , including the ATG codon . Six stably transfected antisense ( AS-2 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 12 ) and eight control clones were characterized . All clones produced high levels of uPA activity . Examination of collagenase production and doubling time showed that all of the clones tested produced similar activities . The antisense clones showed a 20-74 % reduction in the Q03405 sites ; the Q03405 mRNA level was also reduced . A test of the invasive ability of all clones in a modified chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) showed that invasiveness of the antisense-inhibited clones was directly proportional to the density of surface Q03405 . The AS-2 clone , which expressed the lowest number of uPARs showed a significantly reduced level of invasion . The invasiveness of additional AS-inhibited clones was also reduced . Seven control and four AS-inhibited clones were tested for tumorigenicity on CAMs of chick embryos . Inoculation of control cells produced large tumors , while the As clones were non-tumorigenic . AS-2 did not produce tumors even if kept in vivo for up to 10 weeks. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) are potential predictive biomarkers in early stage oral squamous cell carcinomas ( OSCC ) . Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is often associated with metastatic disease and a poor 5 year survival rate . Patients diagnosed with small tumours generally have a more favourable outcome , but some of these small tumours are aggressive and lead to early death . To avoid harmful overtreatment of patients with favourable prognosis , there is a need for predictive biomarkers that can be used for treatment stratification . In this study we assessed the possibility to use components of the plasminogen activator ( PA ) system as prognostic markers for OSCC outcome and compared this to the commonly used biomarker Ki-67 . A tissue-micro-array ( TMA ) based immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumour tissue obtained from a North Norwegian cohort of 115 patients diagnosed with OSCC was conducted . The expression of the biomarkers was compared with clinicopathological variables and disease specific death . The statistical analyses revealed that low expression of Q03405 ( p = 0.031 ) and P05121 ( p = 0.021 ) in the tumour cells was significantly associated with low disease specific death in patients with small tumours and no lymph node metastasis ( T1N0 ) . The commonly used biomarker , Ki-67 , was not associated with disease specific death in any of the groups of patients analysed . The conclusion is that Q03405 and P05121 are potential predictive biomarkers in early stage tumours and that this warrants further studies on a larger cohort of patients . DB00013 mediates endothelial cell survival via induction of the P98170 . P00749 ( uPA ) additionally elicits a whole array of pro-angiogenic responses , such as differentiation , proliferation , and migration . In this study , we demonstrate that in endothelial cells uPA also protects against apoptosis by transcriptional up-regulation and partially by mRNA stabilization of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins , most prominently the P98170 ( P98170 ) . The antiapoptotic activity of uPA was dependent on its protease activity , the presence of uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ( Q14764 ) , but independent of the phosphatidylinositol 3 ( P19957 ) kinase pathway , whereas vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -induced antiapoptosis was P19957 kinase dependent . uPA-induced cell survival involved phosphorylation of Q13153 ( Pak1 ) and the O15111 alpha that leads to nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) p52 activation . Indeed , blocking NF-kappaB activation by using specific NF-kappaB inhibitors abolished uPA-induced cell survival as it blocked uPA-induced P98170 up-regulation . Furthermore , down-regulating P98170 expression by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) significantly reduced uPA-dependent endothelial cell survival . This mechanism is also important for P15692 -induced antiapoptosis because P15692 -dependent up-regulation of P98170 was found defective in uPA(-/-) endothelial cells . This led us to conclude that uPA is part of a novel NF-kappaB-dependent cell survival pathway . Regulation of the Q03405 /uPA system expressed on monocytes by the deactivating cytokines , P05112 , P22301 and P35225 : consequences on cell adhesion to vitronectin and fibrinogen . DB00013 ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) have been proposed to be involved in monocyte migration by inducing degradation of matrix proteins . In addition , Q03405 is also implicated in cell adhesion to the vascular wall . The adhesive function of Q03405 depends on a direct interaction with vitronectin which is increased by uPA and by modification of cell surface integrin ( such as CD11b- P05107 ) when associated to Q03405 . In this study we analysed the role of three deactivating cytokines , P05112 , P22301 and P35225 , on the surface expression of uPA , Q03405 and CD11b by monocytes and their consequences on monocyte adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and vitronectin . P22301 induced a decrease in uPA and CD11b after 18 h incubation and a delayed decrease in Q03405 which was only significant after 48 h incubation . These results may explain the decrease in monocyte adhesion , which was observed after an 18 h incubation with P22301 , on immobilized vitronectin and fibrinogen . In contrast , P05112 and P35225 induced a decrease in Q03405 after 18 h and a significant increase in uPA both in the cell lysates and at the cell surface , as well as an increase in cell surface associated CD11b . These cytokines did not modify cell adhesiveness to vitronectin or fibrinogen despite the increase in CD11b- P05107 . This could be due to the decrease in Q03405 because CD11b- P05107 / Q03405 forms a cell adhesion complex . In addition , the increase in uPA induced by P05112 could counterbalance the direct interaction of Q03405 with vitronectin . The increase in uPA suggests that P05112 and P35225 could induce plaque fissuring by monocytes , whereas P22301 may induce protection against matrix protein degradation by decreasing uPA . DB00013 mediates fibrinolysis in the pulmonary microvasculature . The role of urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) in fibrinolysis remains unsettled . The contribution of uPA may depend on the vascular location , the physical properties of the clot , and its impact on tissue function . To study the contribution of urokinase within the pulmonary microvasculature , a model of pulmonary microembolism in the mouse was developed . Iodine 125 ( (125)I ) -labeled fibrin microparticles injected intravenously through the tail vein lodged preferentially in the lung , distributing homogeneously throughout the lobes . Clearance of (125)I-microemboli in wild type mice was rapid and essentially complete by 5 hours . In contrast , uPA(-/-) and tissue-type plasminogen activator tPA(-/-) mice , but not Q03405 (-/-) mice , showed a marked impairment in pulmonary fibrinolysis throughout the experimental period . The phenotype in the uPA(-/-) mouse was rescued completely by infusion of single chain uPA ( scuPA ) . The increment in clot lysis was 4-fold greater in uPA(-/-) mice infused with the same concentration of scuPA complexed with soluble recombinant Q03405 . These data indicate that uPA contributes to endogenous fibrinolysis in the pulmonary vasculature to the same extent as tPA in this model system . Binding of scuPA to its receptor promotes fibrinolytic activity in vivo as well as in vitro . The physical properties of fibrin clots , including size , age , and cellular composition , as well as heterogeneity in endothelial cell function , may modify the participation of uPA in endogenous fibrinolysis . ( Blood. 2000;96:1820-1826 ) Signalling pathways involved in retinal endothelial cell proliferation induced by advanced glycation end products : inhibitory effect of gliclazide . AIM : We have previously demonstrated that advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) stimulate bovine retinal endothelial cell ( BREC ) proliferation through induction of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) production by these cells . We have also shown that gliclazide , a sulfonylurea which decreases oxidative stress , inhibits this effect . The aim of the present study was to characterize the signalling pathways involved in P51606 -induced BREC proliferation and P15692 production and mediating the inhibitory effect of gliclazide on these biological events . METHODS : BRECs were treated or not treated with AGEs in the presence or absence of gliclazide , antioxidants , protein kinase C ( PKC ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) or nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) inhibitors . BREC proliferation was assessed by measuring [ 3H ] -thymidine incorporation into DNA . Activation of PKC , MAPK and NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways and determination of P15692 expression were assessed by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies . MAPK activity was also determined by an in vitro kinase assay . RESULTS : Treatment of BRECs with AGEs significantly increased cell proliferation and P15692 expression . AGEs induced P05771 translocation , extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 and NF-kappaB activation in these cells . Pharmacological inhibition of these signalling pathways abolished P51606 effects on cell proliferation and P15692 expression . Exposure of BRECs to gliclazide or antioxidants such as vitamin E or N-acetyl-l-cysteine resulted in a significant decrease in P51606 -induced activation of PKC- , MAPK- and NF-kappaB-signalling pathways . CONCLUSIONS : Our results demonstrate the involvement of PKC , MAPK and NF-kappaB in P51606 -induced BREC proliferation and P15692 expression . DB01120 inhibits BREC proliferation by interfering with these intracellular signal transduction pathways . Examining the genetic and neural components of cognitive flexibility using mice . This commentary summarizes the research presented during the symposium " Examining the genetic and neural components of cognitive flexibility using mice " at the annual meeting of the International Behavioral Neuroscience Society 2011 . Research presented includes examining : 1 ) Corticostriatal networks underlying reversal learning using Q13224 knockout mice , cFos expression , and in vivo electrophysiological recording ; 2 ) Cerebellar contribution to reversal learning using mutants with Purkinje cell loss and in vivo electrochemical recording ; 3 ) Parvalbumin contribution to reversal learning and set-shifting using Q03405 mutants and in vitro recording to examine fast-spiking interneurones ; and 4 ) Alpha 7 nAChR contribution to reversal learning , set-shifting , motivation , and the ' eureka moment ' of rule acquisition . It is proposed that these studies revealed more about the neurobiology underlying these behaviors than could be discovered using pharmacological techniques alone . Together , the research presented stressed the importance of exploring the genetic contribution to neuropsychiatric disease and the important role that the mouse , coupled with robust behavioral measures , can play in understanding neurobiology underlying cognitive flexibility . Helicobacter pylori-induced interleukin-12 p40 expression . Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by antigen-presenting cells that promotes the development of T-helper lymphocyte 1 ( Th1 ) . Chronic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori is considered a Th1-mediated process . IL-12 levels in gastric biopsy samples of H. pylori-infected patients are higher than in those of uninfected individuals , but the cellular source of IL-12 remains elusive . IL-12 staining was detected in mucosal epithelial cells , lymphocytes , and macrophages in specimens of patients with H. pylori-positive gastritis . Therefore , we investigated IL-12 p40 mRNA induction by H. pylori in gastric epithelial cells and T cells . Although cag pathogenicity island ( P05121 ) -positive H. pylori induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression , an isogenic mutant of the cag P05121 failed to induce it in both cell types . Supernatants from H. pylori cultures and H. pylori VacA induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression in T cells but not in epithelial cells . The activation of the IL-12 p40 promoter by H. pylori was mediated through NF-kappaB . The transfection of O15111 and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase dominant-negative mutants inhibited H. pylori-induced IL-12 p40 activation . Inhibitors of NF-kappaB , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and Hsp90 suppressed H. pylori- and VacA-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression . The results indicate that H. pylori induces IL-12 p40 expression by the activation of NF-kappaB , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase . Hsp90 is also a crucial regulator of H. pylori-induced IL-12 p40 expression . In addition to the cag P05121 , VacA might be relevant in the induction of IL-12 expression and a Th1-polarized response only in T cells . Analysis of breast cancer related gene expression using natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model to identify prognostic associations . Many studies correlating gene expression data to clinical parameters assume a linear increase or decrease of the clinical parameter under investigation with the expression of a gene . We have studied genes encoding important breast cancer-related proteins using a model for survival-type data that is based on natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model , thereby removing the linearity assumption . Expression data of 16 genes were studied in relation to metastasis-free probability in a cohort of 295 consecutive breast cancer patients treated at The Netherlands Cancer Institute . The independent predictive power for disease outcome of the 16 individual genes was tested in a multivariable model with known clinical and pathological risk factors . There is a linear relationship between increasing expression and a higher or lower hazard for distant metastasis for P03372 , Q15303 , P15692 , O96020 , Q15910 , and Q96NZ9 ; for P04626 , P21860 , P24385 , P24864 , O75530 , P61073 , P32248 , P48061 , and P05121 there is no clear increase or decrease ; and for P00533 there seems to be a non-linear relation . Multivariable analysis showed that the 70-gene prognosis profile outperforms all the other variables in the model ( hazard-rate 5.4 , 95 % CI 2.5-11.7 ; P = 0.000018 ) . P00533 -expression seems to have a non-linear relation with disease outcome , indicating that lower but also higher expression of P00533 are associated with worse outcome compared to intermediate expression levels ; the other genes show no or a linear relation . DB00502 induces neurotoxicity by the DB01221 receptor downstream signaling pathway , alternative from glutamate excitotoxicity . The DB01221 receptor is believed to be important in a wide range of nervous system functions including neuronal migration , synapse formation , learning and memory . In addition , it is involved in excitotoxic neuronal cell death that occurs in a variety of acute and chronic neurological disorders . Besides of agonist/coagonist sites , other modulator sites , including butyrophenone site may regulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor . It has been shown that haloperidol , an antipsychotic neuroleptic drug , interacts with the Q13224 subunit of DB01221 receptor and inhibits DB01221 response in neuronal cells . We found that DB01221 receptor was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Ras antibody and this complex , beside NR2 subunit of DB01221 receptor contained haloperidol-binding proteins , P29475 and Ras- P01286 . Furthermore , we have shown that haloperidol induces neurotoxicity of neuronal cells via DB01221 receptor complex , accompanied by dissociation of Ras- P01286 from membranes and activation of c-Jun-kinase . Inclusion of insulin prevented relocalization of Ras- P01286 and subsequent neuronal death . DB00502 -induced dissociation of Ras- P01286 leads to inhibition of membrane-bound form of Ras protein and changes downstream regulators activity that results in the initiation of the apoptotic processes via the mitochondrial way . Our results suggest that haloperidol induces neuronal cell death by the interaction with DB01221 receptor , but through the alternative from glutamate excitotoxicity signaling pathway . DB00013 binds to a plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2-like molecule in placental microvillous membranes . Placental microvillous membranes exhibited saturable binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activator with plateau achieved by 30 min at 4 degrees C and 10 min at 37 degrees C . The binding was essentially irreversible . The capacity was about 8 pmol urokinase per mg membrane protein . Half-maximal displacement of 125I-labelled urokinase was achieved with about 1.0 nM unlabelled urokinase when using 75 micrograms membrane protein/ml . 125I-labelled urokinase did not bind when treated with diisopropylfluorophosphate to block the catalytic activity . Single-chain urokinase ( prourokinase ) , devoid of catalytic activity , did not bind . Catalytically active tissue-type plasminogen activator did compete with 125I-labelled urokinase for binding although less efficiently than urokinase . Binding activity remained in the 100,000 x g pellet after treatment of the membranes with 3 M DB00761 , alkaline stripping at pH 12 or extraction by the detergent Triton X-100 . The binding was essentially blocked by antibodies against plasminogen activator inhibitor-type-2 ( P05120 ) . DB00815 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized membranes with bound 125I-labelled urokinase showed that the urokinase- P05120 complexes largely migrated in fractions corresponding to a very large Mr although no clearly defined peaks were observed . It is suggested that P05120 occurs in a form anchored to syncytiotrophoblast microvilli , possibly to the cytoskeleton . aChE and BuChE inhibition by rivastigmin have no effect on peripheral insulin resistance in elderly patients with Alzheimer disease . BACKGROUND : P01308 resistance ( IR ) may play a role in most pathogenic processes that promote the development of Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ( LOAD ) . This study was designed to determine the interaction between inhibition of both butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) and acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) with rivastigmine and peripheral insulin resistance ( IR ) in LOAD . METHODS : Seventy-Nine consecutive elderly patients , 31 late onset AD and 48 non-demented patients were evaluated . IR was calculated with HOMA . All of the patients were evaluated through comprehensive geriatric assessments at baseline and in the 6th and 12th months . RESULTS : End of the study , compared to the baseline values , there was a significant increase in the 6th month in both MMSE and IADL scores ( t =2.200 , p = 0.036 for MMSE and t =2.724 , p= 0.011 for IADL , respectively ) . DB00989 was improved both the scores of MMSE and IADL in elderly patients with LOAD , but there was no significance or correlation between HOMA scores and cognitive status . CONCLUSION : In conclusion , inhibition of both BuChE and P22303 with rivastigmine was improved the cognition without affecting on the peripheral IR in the elderly patients with LOAD by HOMA . Due to the complexity of disease pathogenesis , it is too early to make general comments , and further longitudinal and long-term studies on this issue are needed . Modulation of leukocyte transendothelial migration by integrin-associated glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol ( P06744 ) -anchored proteins . Leukocyte transendothelial migration is an essential process in inflammation and the immune response . The mechanisms involved in leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium , forming the first step in leukocyte extravasation , have been fairly well documented . However , subsequent steps , which include de-adhesion , coupled with locomotion , remain largely unknown . As part of our efforts to study leukocyte transendothelial migration , we previously established a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) that sequentially up-regulates and down-regulates beta2 integrin-dependent adhesion of human neutrophils , as well as transendothelial migration in vitro . The molecule recognized by this mAb is a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol , ( P06744 ) -anchored glycoprotein . This protein may prove to be a new member of the family of integrin-associated , P06744 -anchored proteins , which includes urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) /LPS binding protein ( P18428 ) receptor ( P08571 ) , and Fcgamma receptor IIIB ( CD16b ) ; all of which are regulators of integrin function . The mechanisms involved in beta2 integrin regulation by this new P06744 -anchored glycoprotein are discussed . P00747 activator inhibitor type 1 ( P05121 ) is a valuable biomarker for predicting the metabolic syndrome ( MS ) in institutionalized elderly residents in Taiwan . Circulating levels of inflammatory and prothrombotic factors are elevated in the metabolic syndrome ( MS ) and linked with the occurrence of cardiovascular events . The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between inflammatory and prothrombotic markers and the MS in elderly institutionalized residents . A total of 326 non-diabetic residents of Chuang-Hua Veterans Care Home ( age : 79.9+/-4.1 years ; 100 % males ) were enrolled . MS was diagnosed according to the DB00551 /NHLBI Scientific Statement criteria . Body fat percentage was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis . P01308 resistance was calculated by homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) . Inflammatory markers , including tumor necrosis factor-a ( P01375 ) , high sensitivity P02741 ( hsCRP ) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , were determined using ELISA . Elderly residents with the MS had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures ( both p < 0.001 ) and higher HOMA-IR ( p < 0.001 ) , hsCRP ( p = 0.008 ) , and P05121 levels ( p < 0.001 ) than those without the MS . On multivariate logistic regression analysis , P05121 was an independent risk factor for the MS . Of the MS components , elderly residents with higher waist circumferences and higher levels of plasma fasting glucose , and triglyceride ( TG ) , and lower levels of high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) had higher P05121 levels than those without the above components . An anti-urokinase plasminogen activator receptor antibody ( ATN-658 ) blocks prostate cancer invasion , migration , growth , and experimental skeletal metastasis in vitro and in vivo . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) is a multidomain protein that plays important roles in the growth , invasion , and metastasis of a number of cancers . In the present study , we examined the effects of administration of a monoclonal anti- Q03405 antibody ( ATN-658 ) on prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo . We examined the effect of treatment of ATN-658 on human prostate cancer cell invasion , migration , proliferation , and regulation of intracellular signaling pathways . For in vivo studies , PC-3 cells ( 1 x 10(6) ) were inoculated into the right flank of male Balb C nu/nu mice through subcutaneous or through intratibial route ( 2 x 10(5) ) of male Fox Chase severe combined immunodeficient mice to monitor the effect on tumor growth and skeletal metastasis . Treatment with ATN-658 resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in PC-3 cell invasion and migration without affecting cell doubling time . Western blot analysis showed that ATN-658 treatment decreased the phosphorylation of serine/threonine protein kinase B ( AKT ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , and focal adhesion kinase ( Q05397 ) without affecting AKT , MAPK , and Q05397 total protein expression . In in vivo studies , ATN-658 caused a significant decrease in tumor volume and a marked reduction in skeletal lesions as determined by Faxitron x-ray and micro-computed tomography . Immunohistochemical analysis of subcutaneous and tibial tumors showed a marked decrease in the levels of expression of pAKT , pMAPK , and pFAK , consistent with the in vitro observations . Results from these studies provide compelling evidence for the continued development of ATN-658 as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate and other cancers expressing Q03405 . Reduced plasminogen activator content of the endometrium in oral contraceptive users . Human endometrium was found to contain two different plasminogen activators , urokinase and tissue activator . DB00013 was released in higher amounts from endometrial tissue explants obtained in the midcycle phase than from those obtained in the luteal phase . P00747 activator activity of the culture medium followed the same pattern . Treatment of postmenopausal patients with ethinylestradiol resulted in liberation of urokinase and tissue activator from endometrial explants in concentrations similar to those found in the normal midcycle phase . In contrast , treatment with oral contraceptives ( OCs ) , containing ethinylestradiol and a progestagen , resulted in lowered release of both activators , even lower than was found during the normal luteal phase . Also the amounts of extractable urokinase from endometrial tissue samples were significantly lower in OC-users than in non-users . Estradiol seems to have a stimulatory effect on the release of plasminogen activators from the endometrium ; whereas , gestagens depress the content and release of activators . The low content of plasminogen activators in the endometrium explains the reduced menstrual bleedings found in OC-users . Serotonin induces the expression of tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , or 5-HT ) , released from activated platelets , not only accelerates aggregation of platelets but also is known to promote mitosis , migration , and contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . These effects are considered to contribute to thrombus formation and atherosclerosis . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 5-HT on the expressions of coagulative and fibrinolytic factors in rat aortic endothelial cells . Endothelial cells were stimulated with various concentrations of 5-HT ( 0.1 approximately 10 microM ) , and the expressions of tissue factor ( TF ) , tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( P10646 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , and tissue-type plasminogen activator ( TPA ) messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) were evaluated by Northern blot analysis . The activities of TF and P05121 were also measured . TF and P05121 mRNA were increased significantly in a concentration- and time-dependent manner . However , P10646 and TPA mRNA expression did not change . The inductions of TF and P05121 mRNAs were inhibited by a 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist ( methiothepin ) and a selective 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist ( D6RGH6 -9042 ) . These results indicate that 5-HT increases procoagulant activity and reduces fibrinolytic activities of endothelial cells through the 5- Q13049 receptor . It was concluded that the modulation of procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic activities of endothelial cells by 5-HT synergistically promotes thrombus formation at the site of vessel injury with the platelet aggregation , VSMC contraction , and VSMC proliferation . [ DB00013 therapy of deep vein thrombosis ( author 's transl ) ] . 30 patients with deep vein thrombosis were treated with a combination of urokinase and heparin . Clinically relevant improvement was achieved in 2/3 of them with appr . 40,000 IU/h ( 1,000,000 IU/d ) urokinase administered over a period of several days . This indicates that urokinase at this dosage offers a valuable alternative or supplementation to fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase . With the dosage employed , routine blood coagulation tests are only minimally affected , although a strong enhancement of fibrinolytic activity can be demonstrated by the euglobulin clot lysis time . P00747 depletion - as is usually observed with streptokinase therapy - does not occur . DB00013 is well tolerated and there is only a very moderate bleeding tendency . The cost per day of urokinase therapy at the dosage employed is approximately twice that of customary streptokinase therapy . P00747 activation by airway smooth muscle is regulated by type I collagen . Plasmin , the activated protease product of plasminogen , is involved in collagen remodeling , and is strongly implicated in asthma pathophysiology by recent genome-wide association studies . This study examines plasminogen " activation " by airway smooth muscle cells , and its regulation in a fibrotic environment created by culture on type I collagen and incubation with transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) activity was detected in the supernatants of human airway smooth muscle cell cultures maintained in serum-free conditions . Incubation with plasminogen ( 1.5-50.0 μg/ml , 24 h ) increased plasmin activity in a concentration-dependent manner ( P < 0.001 ) . uPA activity was higher in cultures maintained on fibrillar type I collagen substrata than in those on plastic , as was plasmin activity after incubation with plasminogen ( 20 μg/ml ) . Pretreatment with TGF-β ( 100 pM ) for 18 hours inhibited plasminogen activation by airway smooth muscle cells maintained on plastic , but not on collagen . TGF-β stimulated an increase in the level of uPA mRNA in airway smooth muscle cells grown on collagen , but not on plastic . Reducing the levels of β1-integrin collagen receptor , using interference RNA , attenuated plasmin formation by airway smooth muscle cells grown on collagen , and restored the inhibitory effect of TGF-β . This study shows that airway smooth muscle activation of plasminogen by uPA is accelerated in a collagen-rich environment in which the inhibitory effect of TGF-β is attenuated in association with greater uPA expression induced via β1-integrin signaling . These findings suggest that the plasminogen-activation system involving uPA has the potential to contribute to airway wall remodeling in asthma . Targeting the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor enhances gene transfer to human airway epithelia . Developing gene therapy for cystic fibrosis has been hindered by limited binding and endocytosis of vectors by human airway epithelia . Here we show that the apical membrane of airway epithelia express the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , or a 7-residue peptide derived from this protein ( u7-peptide ) , bound the receptor and stimulated apical endocytosis . Both ligands enhanced gene transfer by nonspecifically bound adenovirus and adeno-associated virus vectors and by a modified adenovirus vector that had been coupled to the u7-peptide . These data provide the first evidence that targeting an apical receptor can circumvent the two most important barriers to gene transfer in airway epithelia . Thus , the uPA/ Q03405 system may offer significant advantages for delivering genes and other pharmaceuticals to airway epithelia . DB00989 improves hippocampal neurogenesis and depression-like behaviors via P08908 receptor stimulation in olfactory bulbectomized mice . DB00989 is a non-competitive inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) and butylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) used to treat mild to moderate dementia in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) patients . Although rivastigmine reportedly ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in these patients , its ability to improve Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia ( BPSD ) remains unclear . To determine whether rivastigmine treatment antagonizes depression-like behaviors , we chronically administered rivastigmine ( 0.1-1.0mg/kg ) to olfactory bulbectomized ( OBX ) mice once a day for 2weeks , starting 2weeks after bulbectomy . Chronic treatment at 0.3 or 1.0mg/kg dose dependently and significantly improved depression-like behaviors , as assessed by tail suspension ( Q16762 ) , forced swim ( P19883 ) , locomotion and novelty-suppressed feeding ( NSFT ) tests . Importantly , co-administration with WAY-100635 ( 1.0mg/kg ) , a P08908 receptor antagonist , but not ketanserin ( 1.0mg/kg , ) , a 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist , completely blocked rivastigmine-induced anti-depressive effects , suggesting that P08908 receptor stimulation mediates this activity . Consistent with this observation , rivastigmine treatment significantly rescued impaired neurogenesis observed in OBX mice in a P08908 receptor-dependent manner . Furthermore , enhanced protein kinase B ( Akt ) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) phosphorylation seen following rivastigmine treatment was closely associated with improved neurogenesis . These effects were blocked by WAY-100635 but not ketanserin treatment . Finally , we confirmed that P08908 but not 5- Q13049 receptor stimulation by specific agonists mimicked rivastigmine-induced anti-depression activity and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis . We conclude that , in addition to enhancing the cholinergic system , rivastigmine treatment restores normal function of the hippocampal serotonergic system , an activity that likely ameliorates depressive behaviors in AD patients . DB00013 plasminogen activator is a central regulator of macrophage three-dimensional invasion , matrix degradation , and adhesion . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) coordinate a plasmin-mediated proteolytic cascade that has been implicated in cell adhesion , cell motility , and matrix breakdown , for example , during inflammation . As part of their function during inflammatory responses , macrophages move through tissues and encounter both two-dimensional ( 2D ) surfaces and more complex three-dimensional ( 3D ) interstitial matrices . Based on approaches employing uPA gene-deficient macrophages , plasminogen supplementation , and neutralization with specific protease inhibitors , it is reported in this study that uPA activity is a central component of the invasion of macrophages through a 3D Matrigel barrier ; it also has a nonredundant role in macrophage-mediated matrix degradation . For murine macrophages , matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity was found to be required for these uPA-mediated effects . Evidence for a unique role for uPA in the inverse relationship between macrophage adhesion and 2D migration was also noted : macrophage adhesion to vitronectin was enhanced by uPA and blocked by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , the latter approach also able to enhance in turn the 2D migration on this matrix protein . It is therefore proposed that uPA can have a key role in the inflammatory response at several levels as a central regulator of macrophage 3D invasion , matrix remodeling , and adhesion . DB00013 receptor interacts with alpha(v)beta5 vitronectin receptor , promoting urokinase-dependent cell migration in breast cancer . Perturbation of adhesive interactions at cell-substratum and cell-cell contact sites is a critical event in the multistep process of cancer invasion . Recent studies indicate that the urokinase receptor ( Q03405 ) is associated in large molecular complexes with other molecules , such as integrins . To test the possibility that Q03405 may physically and functionally interact with vitronectin ( Vn ) receptors , we determined the expression level of Q03405 , alpha(v)beta3 , and alpha(v)beta5 Vn receptors in 10 human breast carcinomas . Here , we show the ability of Q03405 to physically associate with alpha(v)beta5 in the breast carcinomas examined . The functional effects of this interaction were studied using HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell lines , both exhibiting a urokinase-dependent physical association between Q03405 and alpha(v)beta5 . Both cell lines respond to urokinase or to its noncatalytic amino-terminal fragment by exhibiting remarkable cytoskeletal rearrangements that are mediated by alpha(v)beta5 and require protein kinase C activity . On the contrary , binding of Vn to alpha(v)beta5 results in the protein kinase C-independent formation of F-actin containing microspike-type structures . Furthermore , alpha(v)beta5 is required for urokinase-directed , receptor-dependent MCF-7 and HT1080 cell migration . These data show that Q03405 association with alpha(v)beta5 leads to a functional interaction of these receptors and suggest that Q03405 directs cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration by altering alpha(v)beta5 signaling specificity . P10275 rediscovered : the new biology and targeting the androgen receptor therapeutically . Discoveries over the past decade suggest that castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) is sensitive , but not resistant to , further manipulation of the androgen-androgen receptor ( AR ) axis . Several new therapies that target this axis have demonstrated clinical activity . In this article , preclinical and clinical findings occurring in the field of AR-targeted therapies are reviewed . Reviews of scientific and clinical development are divided into those occurring prereceptor ( androgen production and conversion ) and at the level of the receptor ( AR aberrations and therapies targeting AR directly ) . Intracrine androgen production and AR amplification , among others , are among the principal aberrancies driving CRPC growth . Phase III data with abiraterone acetate and phase II data with DB08899 , along with other similar therapies , confirm for the clinician that the scientific findings related to persistent AR signaling in a castrate milieu can be harnessed to produce significant clinical benefit for patients with the disease . Studies aimed at optimizing the timing of their use and exploring the mechanisms of resistance to these therapies are under way . The clinical success of therapies that directly target androgen synthesis as well as the most common aberrancies of the AR confirm that prostate cancer retains dependence on AR signaling , even in the castrate state . Effect of valproic acid through regulation of DB01221 receptor- P29323 signaling in sleep deprivation rats . Although the effect of mood stabilizer valproic acid ( DB00313 ) through multiple signaling pathways has been shown , its therapeutic mechanism is still largely unknown . We investigated the effect of DB00313 ( 200 mg/kg , every 12 h ) in sleep deprivation ( SD ) rats ( 72 h ) , the manic-like animal model , focusing on the N-methyl-D : -aspartic acid ( DB01221 ) receptor and signaling mediators of synaptic plasticity such as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( P29323 ) , DB02527 response element-binding protein ( CREB ) , B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 ( P10415 ) , and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) . SD reduced the expression of the Q13224 subunit of the DB01221 receptor in the frontal cortex and hippocampus but did not affect the expression of Q9UHB4 and Q12879 subunits . In comparison , DB00313 inhibited the SD-induced reduction of Q13224 expression in both brain regions . In addition , SD attenuated P29323 phosphorylation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus , whereas DB00313 prevented the attenuation . DB00313 also protected the SD-induced decrease of CREB phosphorylation , P10415 expression , and P23560 expression in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus . These results indicate that DB00313 could regulate DB01221 receptor- P29323 signaling in SD rats , preventing the SD-induced decrease of the expression of Q13224 subunit and the activation of P29323 signaling mediators such as P29323 , CREB , P10415 , and P23560 . Differential roles of Q03405 in peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis . Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States . Most cases are diagnosed at late stages , with the solid tumor masses growing as peritoneal implants , or floating within the ascitic fluid ( peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis ) . Despite aggressive surgical " debulking , " recurrence of recalcitrant disease is frequent with poor patient survival . Efforts to improve survival rates are hindered by lack of biomarkers that can detect and effectively treat ovarian cancer in its early stages . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) is a multifunctional receptor involved in a myriad of tumor cell processes . However , the role of host Q03405 in ovarian cancer is still elusive . To define the potential proinflammatory role of Q03405 in ovarian cancer , first , using a syngeneic murine model in Q03405 (-/-) mice , we found that ablation of Q03405 restrained tumor take and peritoneal implants and prolonged the survival of Q03405 (-/-) mice compared with their Q03405 (+/+) counterparts . Ascitic fluid accumulation was significantly decreased in Q03405 (-/-) mice with decreased macrophage infiltration . Second , in vitro mechanistic studies revealed that host Q03405 is involved in the multiple steps of peritoneal metastatic cascade . Third , we evaluated the prognostic utility of tumor and stromal Q03405 in human ovarian cancer tissue microarray . In summary , our studies indicated that Q03405 plays a significant role in ovarian cancer cell-stromal crosstalk and contributes to increased vascular permeability and inflammatory ovarian cancer microenvironment . This provides a rationale for targeting the Q03405 with either specific neutralizing antibodies or targeting its downstream inflammatory effectors in patients with ovarian cancer . P09486 -induced migration of glioblastoma cell lines via uPA- Q03405 signaling and activation of small GTPase RhoA . P09486 ( P09486 ) is highly expressed in human gliomas where it promotes invasion and delays tumor growth , both in vitro and in vivo . P09486 , which interacts at the cell surface , has an impact on intracellular signaling and downstream gene expression changes , which might account for some of its effects on invasion and growth . Additionally in vitro studies demonstrated that P09486 delays growth , increases attachment , and modulates migration of tumor cells in an extracellular matrix-specific and concentration-dependent manner . Because the signaling aspect of this migration is neither well understood nor characterized , we overexpressed P09486 in both the minimally-invasive U87 cell line and in the most aggressive invasive cell line , SNB19 . We first performed RT-PCR analysis and observed an upregulation of uPA and its receptor , Q03405 . We also observed increased expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 ( P08253 and P14780 ) . Western blot analysis confirmed these results , and the enzymatic activity of the metalloproteinases and uPA was further supported by zymography . Downstream of the uPA- Q03405 interaction , upregulation of P19957 -K occurred in cells overexpressing P09486 . Using Q86UG4 -TRBD , we showed the upregulation of active GTP-bound RhoA , but neither Rac1 nor Cdc42 were activated . The inhibition of uPA and Q03405 downregulated P19957 -K activity and cell migration , as shown by matrigel invasion assay . A dorsal skin-fold chamber model revealed the high angiogenic activity of P09486 , though the proliferation of P09486 overexpressing cells was unaffected . Our results show that the small GTPase RhoA was a critical mediator of invasion or migration in the uPA- Q03405 / P19957 -K signaling pathway . miR-17-5p targets the p300/CBP-associated factor and modulates androgen receptor transcriptional activity in cultured prostate cancer cells . BACKGROUND : P10275 ( AR ) signalling is critical to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) . Transcriptional activity of AR involves chromatin recruitment of co-activators , including the p300/CBP-associated factor ( Q92831 ) . Distinct miRNA expression profiles have been identified in PCa cells during the development and progression of the disease . Whether miRNAs regulate Q92831 expression in PCa cells to regulate AR transcriptional activity is still unclear . METHODS : Expression of Q92831 was investigated in several PCa cell lines by qRT-PCR , Western blot , and immunocytochemistry . The effects of Q92831 expression on AR-regulated transcriptional activity and cell growth in PCa cells were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation , reporter gene construct analysis , and MTS assay . Targeting of Q92831 by miR-17-5p was evaluated using the luciferase reporter assay . RESULTS : Q92831 was upregulated in several PCa cell lines . Upregulation of Q92831 promoted AR transcriptional activation and cell growth in cultured PCa cells . Expression of Q92831 in PCa cells was associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p . Targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of Q92831 mRNA by miR-17-5p caused translational suppression and RNA degradation , and , consequently , modulation of AR transcriptional activity in PCa cells . CONCLUSIONS : Q92831 is upregulated in cultured PCa cells , and upregulation of Q92831 is associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p . Targeting of Q92831 by miR-17-5p modulates AR transcriptional activity and cell growth in cultured PCa cells . Effect of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on behavior and key members of the brain serotonin system in mouse strains genetically predisposed to behavioral disorders . The effect of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( P39905 ) on behavior and on the serotonin ( 5-HT ) system of a mouse strain predisposed to depressive-like behavior , ASC/Icg ( Antidepressant Sensitive Cataleptics ) , in comparison with the parental " nondepressive " CBA/Lac mice was studied . Within 7 days after acute administration , P39905 ( 800 ng , i.c.v. ) decreased cataleptic immobility but increased depressive-like behavioral traits in both investigated mouse strains and produced anxiolytic effects in ASC mice . The expression of the gene encoding the key enzyme for 5-HT biosynthesis in the brain , tryptophan hydroxylase-2 ( Tph-2 ) , and P08908 receptor gene in the midbrain as well as 5- Q13049 receptor gene in the frontal cortex were increased in P39905 -treated ASC mice . At the same time , P39905 decreased P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptor gene expression in the hippocampus of ASC mice . P39905 failed to change Tph2 , P08908 , or 5- Q13049 receptor mRNA levels in CBA mice as well as 5-HT transporter gene expression and P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptor functional activity in both investigated mouse strains . The results show 1 ) a P39905 -induced increase in the expression of key genes of the brain 5-HT system , Tph2 , P08908 , and 5- Q13049 receptors , and 2 ) significant genotype-dependent differences in the 5-HT system response to P39905 treatment . The data suggest that genetically defined cross-talk between neurotrophic factors and the brain 5-HT system underlies the variability in behavioral response to P39905 . Suppression of NF-kappaB activity by sulfasalazine is mediated by direct inhibition of IkappaB kinases alpha and beta . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Activation of NF-kappaB/Rel has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) . Various drugs used in the treatment of Q9UKU7 , such as glucocorticoids , DB00244 , and sulfasalazine , interfere with NF-kappaB/Rel signaling . The aim of this study was to define the molecular mechanism by which sulfasalazine inhibits NF-kappaB activation . METHODS : The effects of sulfasalazine and its moieties on NF-kappaB signaling were evaluated using electromobility shift , transfection , and immune complex kinase assays . The direct effect of sulfasalazine on O15111 ( IKK ) activity was investigated using purified recombinant O15111 and -beta proteins . RESULTS : NF-kappaB/Rel activity induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , or overexpression of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase , O15111 , O14920 , or constitutively active O15111 and O14920 mutants was inhibited dose dependently by sulfasalazine . Sulfasalazine inhibited tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced activation of endogenous IKK in Jurkat T cells and SW620 colon cells , as well as the catalytic activity of purified O15111 and O14920 in vitro . In contrast , the moieties of sulfasalazine , DB00244 , and sulfapyridine or DB00233 had no effect . Activation of extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) 1 and 2 , c-Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) 1 , and p38 was unaffected by sulfasalazine . The decrease in substrate phosphorylation by O15111 and -beta is associated with a decrease in autophosphorylation of IKKs and can be antagonized by excess adenosine triphosphate . CONCLUSIONS : These data identify sulfasalazine as a direct inhibitor of O15111 and -beta by antagonizing adenosine triphosphate binding . The suppression of NF-kappaB activation by inhibition of the IKKs contributes to the well-known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of sulfasalazine . Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives as potential antidepressant agents . Part 1 . A series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives was synthesized and their biological activity was evaluated . The chemical structures of the newly prepared compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR , (13)C NMR and P19957 -HRMS spectra data . All tested compounds proved to be potent P08908 receptor and serotonin transporter protein ( P31645 ) ligands . Among them , compounds 15 , 18 , 19 and 30 showed significant affinity for P08908 and P31645 . Computer docking simulations carried out for compounds 15 , 31 and 32 to models of P08908 receptor and P31645 confirm the results of biological tests . Due to high affinity for the P08908 receptor and moderate affinity for P31645 , compounds 31 , 32 , 35 , and 37 were evaluated for their affinity for D2L , P50406 , P34969 and 5- Q13049 receptors . In vivo tests , in turn , resulted in determining the functional activity of compounds 15 , 18 , 19 and 30 to the P08908 receptor . The results of these tests indicate that all of the ligands possess properties characteristic of P08908 receptor agonists . DB00013 plasminogen activator cleaves its cell surface receptor releasing the ligand-binding domain . The cellular receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( Q03405 ) is a glycolipid-anchored three-domain membrane protein playing a central role in pericellular plasminogen activation . We have found that urokinase ( uPA ) can cleave its receptor between domains 1 and 2 generating a cell-associated Q03405 variant without ligand-binding properties . In extracts of U937 cells there are two Q03405 variants which after complete deglycosylation have apparent molecular masses of 35,000 and 27,000 . Analysis with monoclonal antibodies showed that these variants represented the intact Q03405 and a two-domain form , Q03405 (2+3) , lacking ligand-binding domain 1 . Trypsin treatment showed that both variants are present on the outside of the cells . Addition to the culture medium of an anticatalytic monoclonal antibody to uPA inhibited the formation of the Q03405 (2+3) , indicating that uPA is involved in its generation . Purified Q03405 can be cleaved directly by uPA as well as by plasmin . The uPA-catalyzed cleavage does not require binding of the protease to the receptor through its epidermal growth factor-like receptor-binding domain , since low molecular weight uPA that lacks this domain also cleaves Q03405 . This unusual reaction in which a specific binding protein is proteolytically inactivated by its own ligand may represent a regulatory step in the plasminogen activation cascade . The effectiveness of lurasidone as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex in the treatment of bipolar disorder . The majority of patients with bipolar disorder spend a lot of time in depressive episodes that impose a great burden on patients , caregivers , and society and accounts for the largest part of the morbidity-mortality of the illness . DB08815 is an atypical antipsychotic with a potent binding affinity as antagonist for D2 , 5- Q13049 , P34969 , and partial agonist at P08908 receptors . Affinity for other receptors as H1 and muscarinic were negligible . DB08815 was approved in 2010 for the treatment of schizophrenia and recently , 2013 , for bipolar depression in monotherapy and an adjunct to lithium or valproate . Clinical trials have established that lurasidone adjuvant to lithium or valproate has more efficacy than the placebo and is associated with minimal weight gain and no clinically meaningful alterations in glucose , lipids , or the QT interval . Additional studies are desirable to know the clinical profile of lurasidone in long-term treatment , in patients with bipolar II disorders , and versus other antipsychotic agents . Induction of c-fos Gene Expression by DB00013 -Type P00747 Activator in Human Ovarian Cancer Cells . The ability to fractionate nucleic acids and to determine which of them has sequences complementary to an array of DNA or RNA molecules is one of the most powerful tools of molecular biology . The Southern blot , named for its inventor , is a method for transferring size-fractionated DNA from a gel matrix to a solid support followed by hybridization to a labeled probe ( 1. The identical process for RNA became known as ) the Northern blot i2 1i The identical process for RNA became known as the Northern blot ( 2 ) . Both are , then , often key elements in establishing the identity of nucleic acids of interest . Northern blot analysis was used by us as a tool in order to answer the question whether or not the nuclear transcripitional apparatus of human ovarian cancer cells might be activated in response to the urokinase . P00747 activators , venous leg ulcers and reepithelialization . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : The pathogenesis of leg ulcers due to chronic venous hypertension ( CVH ) seems to be related to perivenular fibrin-film formation due to decreased cutaneous fibrinolytic activity dependent on reduced release of tissue-type plasminogen activator that leads to tissue anoxia and ulcer formation . The purpose of the work is a spectrophotometric evaluation of urokinase ( Q96NZ9 ) at the edge , the floor and in the periulcerous skin of leg ulcers . METHODS : We examined a group of 10 patients with chronic leg ulcers caused by CVH . The biopsies from each patient were taken : ( 1 ) from the edge of the ulcer ; ( 2 ) from the perilesional skin and ( 3 ) from the floor of the ulcer . DB00013 levels were evaluated in the same areas in 10 control subjects . The Q96NZ9 activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm . RESULTS : The results of our study showed that Q96NZ9 is detectable in the center of the ulcer , on the edge , in the perilesional skin , as well as in the controls . Data are statistically significant . The highest levels of Q96NZ9 are found at the edge of the ulcer ; they were lower in the center and in the periulcerous skin . CONCLUSION : A chemoattracting effect of Q96NZ9 on human keratinocytes has been documented and this study showed significantly higher levels of Q96NZ9 at the edge and on the floor of the ulcers , suggesting a possible role of an Q96NZ9 gradient that could promote mobilization of keratinocytes from the edge to the floor , thus inducing reepithelialization . Moreover , Q96NZ9 could play some role in neoangiogenesis and fibroblast chemoattraction , thus contributing in various ways to wound healing . P00747 activator inhibitor type-1 inhibits insulin signaling by competing with alphavbeta3 integrin for vitronectin binding . Functional cooperation between integrins and growth factor receptors has been reported for several systems , one of which is the modulation of insulin signaling by alphavbeta3 integrin . P00747 activator inhibitor type-1 ( P05121 ) , competes with alphavbeta3 integrin for vitronectin ( VN ) binding . Here we report that P05121 , in a VN-dependent manner , prevents the cooperation of alphavbeta3 integrin with insulin signaling in NIH3T3 fibroblasts , resulting in a decrease in insulin-induced protein kinase B ( P31749 ) phosphorylation , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) expression and cell migration . P01308 -induced HUVEC migration and angiotube formation was also enhanced in the presence of VN and this enhancement is inhibited by P05121 . By using specific P05121 mutants with either VN binding or plasminogen activator ( PA ) inhibiting activities ablated , we have shown that the P05121 -mediated interference with insulin signaling occurs through its direct interaction with VN , and not through its PA neutralizing activity . Moreover , using cells deficient for uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) we have demonstrated that the inhibition of P05121 on insulin signaling is independent of Q03405 -VN binding . These results constitute the first demonstration of the interaction of P05121 with the insulin response . DB04946 binding to human and rat dopamine and 5-HT receptors . DB04946 ( DB04946 ; 1- [ 4-[3-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl]propoxy] -3- methoxyphenyl ] ethanone ) is a compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia . DB04946 displays affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and for 5- Q13049 receptors and has a variety of in vivo activities suggestive of an atypical antipsychotic . Here we present an examination of the affinity of iloperidone to a variety of human and rat homologs of dopamine and 5-HT receptor subtypes . We employed receptor binding assays using membranes from cells stably expressing human dopamine D1 , D2S , D2L , D3 , D4 and D5 and 5- Q13049 and P28335 receptors and rat P50406 and P34969 receptors . DB04946 displayed higher affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor ( Ki = 7.1 nM ) than for the dopamine D4 receptor ( Ki = 25 nM ) . DB04946 displayed high affinity for the P50406 and P34969 receptors ( Ki = 42.7 and 21.6 nM , respectively ) , and was found to have higher affinity for the 5- Q13049 ( Ki = 5.6 nM ) than for the P28335 receptor ( Ki = 42.8 nM ) . The potential implications of this receptor binding profile are discussed in comparison with data for other antipsychotic compounds . Genetic polymorphisms , the metabolism of estrogens and breast cancer : a review . Breast cancer is the most common female cancer and the second cause of cancer death in women . Despite recent breakthroughs , much of the etiology of this disease is unknown and the most important risk factor , i.e. , exposure to endogenous and exogenous estrogen throughout life can not explain the heterogeneity of prognosis nor clinical features of patients . Recently , many gene polymorphisms in the metabolism of breast cancer have been described as possible neoplasm etiologic factors . This review is an attempt to summarize the current knowledge about these polymorphisms and to determine new target genes for diagnosis and treatment of the disease . Polymorphisms in the genes P05093 , P11511 , P04798 , P05177 , Q16678 , P22309 , P50225 , 17-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase , P21964 , Q86UG4 , P03372 , and Q92731 are described . DB00013 and its receptor in follicular and inflammatory cysts of the jaws . OBJECTIVE : Proteases are considered critical in peri-cystic tissue degradation required in jaw cyst expansion . We studied the expression of the plasminogen activation system ( plasminogen activators ; their inhibitor type-1 , P05121 ; the receptor for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator , Q03405 ) in follicular and inflammatory cysts of the jaw , to identify a possible role of this system in jaw cyst enlargement . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Jaw cysts were collected by therapeutic enucleation . ELISA and casein zymography were used to measure and characterize plasminogen activators in cyst fluid . By immunohistochemistry we examined the presence of Q03405 in cyst walls and inflammatory cells , and by Western blotting the molecular forms of Q03405 within the cyst fluid . RESULTS : Inflammatory cysts fluid contained higher amounts of plasminogen activators of the urinary-type ( uPA ) , and lower amounts of P05121 , when compared to follicular cysts fluid . Epithelial layers of both types of cysts and inflammatory cells expressed Q03405 . Native 3-domain Q03405 was scarcely detectable within cysts , where its cleavage was accounted for by uPA . CONCLUSION : These data suggest a plasminogen activation-dependent mechanism of cyst enlargement , where only the outward Q03405 expressed on epithelial cells and on inflammatory cells direct the peri-cystic protease cascade , in a way similar to tumor enlargement within tissues . Expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor in human articular chondrocytes : association with caveolin and beta 1-integrin . The urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) in concert with other proteolytic enzymes plays a critical role in cartilage degradation during osteoarthritis . DB00013 receptor ( Q03405 ) , a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein present on the cell surface of various cell types such as cancer cells , fibroblasts , synoviocytes , and chondrocytes , is a key regulator of the plasmin-mediated pericellular proteolysis . Recently , in arthritic synovial tissue increased Q03405 expression has been detected . By immunohistochemical analysis we observed , in addition , enhanced expression of Q03405 in chondrocytes of arthritic samples of human cartilage compared to non-arthritic controls . Using in vitro cultured human chondrocytes , we analyzed whether Q03405 is associated with structural proteins , which are known to be involved in cell signaling and activation . Q03405 in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-stimulated chondrocytes colocalized with caveolin as well as beta 1-integrin , as demonstrated by double immunostaining with specific antibodies . Furthermore , Q03405 was present in caveolae-like structures of chondrocytes as detected by immunoelectron microscopy . Finally , both caveolin and beta 1-integrin were coprecipitated with Q03405 -specific antibodies from cell extracts suggesting that these proteins may form functional complexes in human chondrocytes . The localization of Q03405 in caveolae and its close association with caveolin and beta 1-integrin points to a significance of Q03405 -mediated signaling pathways in human chondrocytes . Transforming growth factor-beta is a strong and fast acting positive regulator of the level of type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor mRNA in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts . We have studied the mechanism of a transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) -stimulated production of type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts . TGF-beta causes an early increase in the P05121 mRNA level which reaches a maximal 50-fold enhancement after 8 h . Blocking of protein synthesis with cycloheximide causes an equally strong increase in the level of P05121 mRNA . Quantitative studies of the effect of TGF-beta on P05121 protein levels in cell extracts and culture media by using monoclonal antibodies are consistent with the effect on P05121 mRNA . The results suggest a primary effect of TGF-beta on P05121 gene transcription , and also suggest the possibility that the transcription of this gene in non-induced cells may be suppressed by a short-lived negatively regulating protein . DB00013 -type ( u-PA ) and tissue-type ( t-PA ) plasminogen activators are decreased in the culture media of TGF-beta-treated cells concomitantly with the increase in P05121 accumulation . These findings show that a primary and important biological effect of TGF-beta may be an overall decreased extracellular proteolytic activity , and give an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-beta action at the genetic level . Association between urokinase-plasminogen activator gene T4065C polymorphism and risk of mitral valve prolapse . BACKGROUND : Abnormalities of collagen and elastic fibers were found in floppy mitral valves ( FMV ) . DB00013 -plasminogen activator ( P00749 ) was suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of elastin and collagen degradation in arterial aneurysm . The role of P00749 genetic variant in mitral valve prolapse ( Q14764 ) has not been studied . We , therefore , performed a case-controlled study investigating the possible relation between the P00749 gene polymorphisms and risk of Q14764 in Taiwan Chinese . METHODS : We studied 100 patients with Q14764 diagnosed by echocardiography and 106 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects . The T4065C and T3995C polymorphisms of the P00749 gene were identified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -based restriction analysis . RESULTS : There was a significant difference in either the genotype distribution or allelic frequencies between Q14764 cases and controls for P00749 gene T4065C polymorphism ( P = 0.0001 and 0.0002 , respectively ) . An odds ratio for risk of Q14764 associated with P00749 T4065C TC genotype was 6.03 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.11-14.83 ) . An odds ratio for risk of Q14764 associated with P00749 T4065C T allele was 4.99 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.93-12.91 ) . There was no significant difference in either the genotype distribution or allelic frequencies between Q14764 cases and controls for P00749 T3995C polymorphism . Further categorization of the Q14764 patients into mild and severe subgroups revealed no statistical difference between these two subgroups for P00749 T4065C and T3995C polymorphisms . CONCLUSIONS : This study shows that patients with Q14764 have a higher frequency of P00749 T4065C TC genotype and T allele that supports a role of the P00749 T4065C polymorphism in determining the risk of Q14764 among the Chinese population in Taiwan . O43609 promotes the degradation of Q03405 and inhibits Q03405 -mediated cell adhesion and proliferation . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) is a P06744 anchored cell surface protein that is closely associated with invasion , migration , and metastasis of cancer cells . Many functional extracellular proteins and transmembrane receptors interact with Q03405 . However , few studies have examined the association of Q03405 with cytoplasm proteins . We previously used yeast two-hybrid screening to isolate several novel Q03405 -interacting cytoplasmic proteins , including Sprouty1 ( O43609 ) , an inhibitor of the ( Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase ) MAPK pathway . In this study , we show that O43609 interacts with Q03405 and directs it toward lysosomal-mediated degradation . Overexpression of O43609 decreased the cell surface and cytoplasmic Q03405 protein level . Moreover , O43609 overexpression augmented Q03405 -induced cell adhesion to vitronectin as well as proliferation of cancer cells . Our results also further support the critical role of O43609 contribution to tumor growth . In a subcutaneous tumor model , overexpression of O43609 in HCT116 or A549 xenograft in athymic nude mice led to great suppression of tumor growth . These results show that O43609 may affect tumor cell function through direct interaction with Q03405 and promote its lysosomal degradation .
RL66 a second-generation curcumin analog has potent in vivo and in vitro anticancer activity in ER‑negative breast cancer models . There is a need for the development of new safe and efficacious drug therapies for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)‑negative breast cancers . 1-Methyl-3,5-bis [ ( E ) -4-pyridyl ) methylidene ] -4-piperidone ( RL66 ) is a second generation curcumin analog that exhibits potent cytotoxicity towards a variety of ER-negative breast cancer cells . Therefore , we have further examined the mechanism of this novel drug in in vitro and in vivo models of ER-negative breast cancer . The mechanistic studies demonstrated that RL66 ( 2 µM ) induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle . Moreover , RL66 ( 2 µM ) caused 40 % of SKBr3 cells to undergo apoptosis after 48 h and this effect was time-dependent . This correlated with an increase in cleaved caspase-3 as shown by western blot analysis . RL66 ( 2 µM ) also decreased P04626 /neu phosphorylation and increased p27 in SKBr3 cells , while in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells RL66 ( 2 µM ) significantly decreased Akt phosphorylation and transiently increased the stress kinases P45983 /2 and MAPK p38 . In addition , RL66 exhibited anti-angiogenic potential in vitro as it inhibited HUVEC cell migration 46 % and the ability of these cells to form tube‑like networks . RL66 ( 8.5 mg/kg ) suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors by 48 % compared to vehicle control following 10 weeks of daily oral administration . Microvessel density in the tumors from treated mice was also decreased 57 % compared to control . Thus our findings demonstrate that RL66 has potent proapoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties in vivo and in vitro and has the potential to be further developed as a drug for the treatment of ER‑negative breast cancer . The effects of trastuzumab on the P01730 +CD25+FoxP3+ and P01730 + Q16552 + T-cell axis in patients with breast cancer . In addition to the direct targeting effects on P04626 -positive cells , trastuzumab may have a therapeutic role modulating the activity of the cellular immune system in patients with breast cancer . To investigate this further , the balance of T-regulatory ( T(reg) ) , Th17 , natural killer ( NK ) and NK T ( NKT ) cells before , during and after trastuzumab therapy was investigated . Sequential frequencies of circulating T(reg) cells , Th17 cells , NK and NKT cells were measured in peripheral blood of breast cancer patients and normal controls throughout therapy . Individuals with breast cancer had significantly higher T(reg) frequencies of peripheral blood compared with healthy controls ( 9.2 or 8.6 vs 6 % ; P < 0.05 ) , and no significant differences in T(reg) frequencies were observed between P04626 -positive and P04626 -negative individuals . The number of Th17 cells was lowest in P04626 -positive patients compared with both healthy controls and P04626 -negative patients ( 0.31 vs 0.75 % or 0.84 % ; P=0.01 ) . There appeared to be an inverse relationship between T(reg) and Th17 frequencies in metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) with T(reg) levels significantly reduced during treatment with trastuzumab ( P=0.04 ) , whereas Th17 frequencies were concomitantly increased ( P=0.04 ) . This study supports earlier data that T(reg) cells are present at higher frequencies in breast cancer patients compared with healthy individuals . For the first time , we show that P04626 -positive individuals with breast carcinomas have reduced numbers of circulating Th17 cells , which appear , in turn to have an inverse relationship with T(reg) frequency in MBC . The change in balance of the T(reg) : Th17 ratio appears to characterise the cancer state , and furthermore , is disrupted by trastuzumab therapy . Genetic alterations and oncogenic pathways associated with breast cancer subtypes . Breast cancers can be divided into subtypes with important implications for prognosis and treatment . We set out to characterize the genetic alterations observed in different breast cancer subtypes and to identify specific candidate genes and pathways associated with subtype biology . mRNA expression levels of estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and P04626 were shown to predict marker status determined by immunohistochemistry and to be effective at assigning samples to subtypes . P04626 (+) cancers were shown to have the greatest frequency of high-level amplification ( independent of the P04626 amplicon itself ) , but triple-negative cancers had the highest overall frequencies of copy gain . Triple-negative cancers also were shown to have more frequent loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue and mutation of P06400 , which may contribute to genomic instability . We identified and validated seven regions of copy number alteration associated with different subtypes , and used integrative bioinformatics analysis to identify candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors , including P04626 , Q14451 , O95251 , O15297 , P24385 , Q92769 , P55317 , and P20936 . We tested the candidate oncogene O95251 and showed that it enhances the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells . The genome-wide and region-specific differences between subtypes suggest the differential activation of oncogenic pathways . Carcinomatous meningitis : Leptomeningeal metastases in solid tumors . Leptomeningeal metastasis ( LM ) results from metastatic spread of cancer to the leptomeninges , giving rise to central nervous system dysfunction . Breast cancer , lung cancer , and melanoma are the most frequent causes of LM among solid tumors in adults . An early diagnosis of LM , before fixed neurologic deficits are manifest , permits earlier and potentially more effective treatment , thus leading to a better quality of life in patients so affected . Apart from a clinical suspicion of LM , diagnosis is dependent upon demonstration of cancer in cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) or radiographic manifestations as revealed by neuraxis imaging . Potentially of use , though not commonly employed , today are use of biomarkers and protein profiling in the P04141 . Symptomatic treatment is directed at pain including headache , nausea , and vomiting , whereas more specific LM-directed therapies include intra- P04141 chemotherapy , systemic chemotherapy , and site-specific radiotherapy . A special emphasis in the review discusses novel agents including targeted therapies , that may be promising in the future management of LM . These new therapies include anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib in nonsmall cell lung cancer , anti- P04626 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in breast cancer , anti- P16410 ipilimumab and anti- P15056 tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as vermurafenib in melanoma , and the antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab are currently under investigation in patients with LM . Challenges of managing patients with LM are manifold and include determining the appropriate patients for treatment as well as the optimal route of administration of intra- P04141 drug therapy . Targeting of preexisting and induced breast cancer stem cells with trastuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) . The antibody trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) has substantially improved overall survival for patients with aggressive P04626 -positive breast cancer . However , about 70 % of all treated patients will experience relapse or disease progression . This may be related to an insufficient targeting of the P16070 (high) P25063 (low) breast cancer stem cell subset , which is not only highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy but also a poor target for trastuzumab due to low P04626 surface expression . Hence , we explored whether the new antibody-drug conjugate DB05773 , which consists of the potent chemotherapeutic DM1 coupled to trastuzumab , could improve the targeting of these tumor-initiating or metastasis-initiating cells . To this aim , primary P04626 -overexpressing tumor cells as well as P04626 -positive and P04626 -negative breast cancer cell lines were treated with DB05773 , and effects on survival , colony formation , gene and protein expression as well as antibody internalization were assessed . This revealed that P16070 (high) P25063 (low) P04626 (low) stem cell-like breast cancer cells show high endocytic activity and are thus particularly sensitive towards the antibody-drug conjugate DB05773 . Consequently , preexisting P16070 (high) P25063 (low) cancer stem cells were depleted by concentrations of DB05773 that did not affect the bulk of the tumor cells . Likewise , colony formation was efficiently suppressed . Moreover , when tumor cells were cocultured with natural killer cells , antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was enhanced , and EMT-mediated induction of stem cell-like properties was prevented in differentiated tumor cells . Thus our study reveals an unanticipated targeting of stem cell-like breast cancer cells by DB05773 that may contribute to the clinical efficacy of this recently approved antibody-drug conjugate . A phase 1 study of weekly dosing of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) in patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor 2-positive breast cancer . BACKGROUND : We conducted a phase 1 , multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study ( TDM3569g ) to assess the safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of single-agent trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) administered weekly and once every 3 weeks in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab . The weekly dose results are described here . METHODS : Patients were administered escalating doses of DB05773 weekly , starting at 1.2 mg/kg . Additional patients were enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) to better characterize tolerability and pharmacokinetics . RESULTS : Twenty-eight patients received weekly DB05773 , and the MTD was determined to be 2.4 mg/kg . In general , DB05773 was well tolerated , requiring few dose modifications or discontinuations because of adverse events ( AEs ) . Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in 19 patients ( 67.9 % ) ; treatment-related AEs occurred in 25 ( 89.3 % ) patients . Exposure to weekly DB05773 was dose-proportional at ≥ 1.2 mg/kg , and accumulation of DB05773 and total trastuzumab was observed . Objective partial tumor responses were reported in 13 ( 46.4 % ) patients ; the median duration of response was 18.6 months , and the 6-month clinical benefit rate was 57.1 % . CONCLUSION : The results suggest that a weekly dose of DB05773 2.4 mg/kg has antitumor activity and is well tolerated in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . Endometrial regenerative cells : a novel stem cell population . Angiogenesis is a critical component of the proliferative endometrial phase of the menstrual cycle . Thus , we hypothesized that a stem cell-like population exist and can be isolated from menstrual blood . Mononuclear cells collected from the menstrual blood contained a subpopulation of adherent cells which could be maintained in tissue culture for > 68 doublings and retained expression of the markers P21926 , CD29 , CD41a , P16070 , P13987 , CD73 , CD90 and CD105 , without karyotypic abnormalities . Proliferative rate of the cells was significantly higher than control umbilical cord derived DB05914 , with doubling occurring every 19.4 hours . These cells , which we termed " Endometrial Regenerative Cells " ( ERC ) were capable of differentiating into 9 lineages : cardiomyocytic , respiratory epithelial , neurocytic , myocytic , endothelial , pancreatic , hepatic , adipocytic , and osteogenic . Additionally , ERC produced P08254 , P09238 , GM- P04141 , angiopoietin-2 and DB00102 at 10-100,000 fold higher levels than two control cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cell lines . Given the ease of extraction and pluripotency of this cell population , we propose ERC as a novel alternative to current stem cells sources . Molecular characterization of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-related non-small cell lung cancer through aberrant methylation and alterations of P00533 signaling . BACKGROUND : The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular influence of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases ( P48444 ) on the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The methylation profiles of 12 genes , and the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and P01116 mutations were determined for samples from 229 NSCLC patients . In addition , protein expression of P00533 and P04626 in 116 NSCLCs was analyzed based on the presence or absence of P48444 . RESULTS : IL-12Rbeta2 and Wif-1 methylation and P04626 overexpression were more frequent events in the P48444 group . Eighty nonmalignant lung tissues had no correlation with any molecular changes between the P48444 and the non- P48444 group . P00533 mutation was significantly higher in the non- P48444 group , while P00533 expression was inversely correlated with % FEV1.0 . In the P48444 group , unmethylated P09486 and Q96HF1 genes or a negative CpG island methylator phenotype ( CIMP ) was a negative prognostic factor , while methylation of p16(INK4A) and WNT antagonist genes was a negative prognostic factor in the non- P48444 group . CONCLUSIONS : Novel characteristics of P48444 -related NSCLC were identified by examination of methylation profiles and alterations of P00533 signaling . In consideration of the high sensitivity to smoking in patients with P48444 , NSCLC with P48444 might be a distinct population of smoke-related NSCLC , the genetic profile of which is quite different from non- P48444 NSCLC . Genetic markers in the EET metabolic pathway are associated with outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Preclinical studies show that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids ( EETs ) regulate cerebrovascular tone and protect against cerebral ischemia . We investigated the relationship between polymorphic genes involved in EET biosynthesis/metabolism , cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) eicosanoid levels , and outcomes in 363 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( DHET ) cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) levels , as well as acute outcomes defined by delayed cerebral ischemia ( P42126 ) or clinical neurologic deterioration ( CND ) , were assessed over 14 days . Long-term outcomes were defined by Modified Rankin Scale ( P59665 ) at 3 and 12 months . P10632 *4 allele carriers had 44 % and 36 % lower mean EET and DHET P04141 levels ( P=0.003 and P=0.007 ) and were 2.2- and 2.5-fold more likely to develop P42126 and CND ( P=0.039 and P=0.041 ) , respectively . P34913 55Arg , P51589 *7 , P10632 *1B , and P10632 g.36785A allele carriers had lower EET and DHET P04141 levels . P10632 g.25369T and P10632 g.36755A allele carriers had higher EET levels . Patients with P10632 *2C and P34913 404del variants had worse long-term outcomes while those with P34913 287Gln , P51589 *7 , and P11712 g.816G variants had favorable outcomes . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid levels were associated with Fisher grade and unfavorable 3-month outcomes . Dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were not associated with outcomes . No associations passed Bonferroni multiple testing correction . These are the first clinical data demonstrating the association between the EET biosynthesis/metabolic pathway and the pathophysiology of aSAH . Letter to the editor concerning ' DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) versus lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer and central nervous system metastases : a retrospective , exploratory analysis in EMILIA ' . DB06366 protects the achilles ' heel of trastuzumab -- emtansine . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) represents a significant advancement in the treatment of P04626 (+) breast cancers . Its clinical efficacy however will be limited by the development of therapeutic resistance . In this report , the P21860 ligand neuregulin is shown to mediate DB05773 resistance , which was overcome by administration of pertuzumab , a steric inhibitor of P04626 dimerization . Treatment of P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer . The HER family of receptors consists of four closely related type 1 transmembrane TK receptors : P00533 ( P00533 ) , P04626 , P21860 and Q15303 . Signalling via the HER family of receptors underpins the majority of the intricate array of cellular activities on which cell survival and functionality depend . Aberrant P04626 expression and/or functionality have been implicated in the evolution of breast cancer and this receptor has proved to be a potent target for anticancer therapies , including antibody-based therapies to prevent ligand binding , dimer formation or the recruitment of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity , and direct kinase inhibition to prevent molecular activation and recruitment of downstream signalling partners . Novel strategies against P04626 include HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors , HSP90 inhibitors and antibody-chemotherapy conjugates . This latter approach is exemplified by DB05773 , a potent antibody that has a good safety profile and that has shown remarkable activity in patients with advanced disease . In addition , pertuzumab , an mAb that directly inhibits the formation of P04626 dimers including the P04626 : P21860 dimer , offers a unique mechanism of P21860 inhibition . All these approaches have shown substantial clinical activity in patients refractory to trastuzumab . It is anticipated that with the increased availability of novel anti- P04626 agents together with a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to anti- P04626 agents we should be able to further improve the outcome of patients with P04626 breast cancer . There will also be an increasing tendency towards moving the study of these agents to earlier stages of the disease , namely in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting . A tumour necrosis factor alpha autocrine loop contributes to proliferation and nuclear factor-kappaB activation of Theileria parva-transformed B cells . Theileria infection of bovine leucocytes induces uncontrolled proliferation and a transformed phenotype comparable to tumour cells . Infected cells have many characteristics of activated leucocytes and use autocrine loops to augment proliferation . We have shown previously that , in infected B cells , P19957 -K controls a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) autocrine loop to increase both proliferation and activation of the activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) transcription factor . We show here that the same infected B cells also use a tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha autocrine loop that again contributes to proliferation and augments nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB activation . Interestingly , both pharmacological inhibition of P01375 synthesis and neutralizing anti- P01375 antibodies lead to a reduction in proliferation and a 50 % drop in NF-kappaB activation , without inducing apoptosis . DB01095 inhibits growth and alters the malignant phenotype of the P13671 glioma cell line . BACKGROUND : DB01095 is a member of the family of P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) extensively used in medical practice . Increasing evidence suggests that fluvastatin may be implicated in suppression of cancer growth and development . The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-cancer potential of fluvastatin in P13671 rat malignant glioma cells . METHODS : First , the effects of fluvastatin on cell viability ( MTT assay ) , proliferation ( BrdU assay ) , cell morphology , and cytoskeleton were examined . Subsequently , its effect on extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 ( P27361 /2 ) and P45983 and 2 ( JNK 1/2 ) expression was estimated by Western blot . Finally , the influence of fluvastatin on cell migration and production of P14780 and P15692 was determined using a wound-healing assay and ELISA test , respectively . RESULTS : The results obtained showed that fluvastatin had a remarkable inhibitory and cytotoxic effect on tumor P13671 cells ( IC(50) = 8.6 μM , 48 h ) , but did not inhibit the growth of normal neuronal cells . The concentrations from 1 to 10 μM induced marked morphologic alterations typical for apoptosis including shrinkage of cytoplasm , chromatin condensation , and nucleus breakdown . CONCLUSION : The inhibitory effects of fluvastatin on cell proliferation seemed to be associated with decreased p- P27361 /2 expression , upregulation of p- P45983 /2 , and reduction in the P14780 and P15692 concentrations in culture media . The high anticancer ( antiproliferative , proapoptotic , antiinvasive ) activity of fluvastatin and lack of its toxicity against normal cells indicate a potential use of this statin in the treatment of malignant glioma . A transcription-independent function of Q12778 in inhibition of androgen-independent activation of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells . Increasing evidence suggests that aberrant activation of the androgen receptor ( AR ) plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of androgen depletion-independent prostate cancer ( PCa ) after androgen deprivation therapy . Here , we show that loss of the P60484 tumor suppressor gene is associated with hyperactivation of the AR in human PCa cell lines . This effect is mediated primarily by its downstream effector Q12778 . In addition to the inhibition of androgenic activation of the AR , forced expression of Q12778 in P60484 -negative PCa cells also inhibits androgen-independent activation of the AR in a manner independent of Q12778 transcriptional function . In contrast , silencing of Q12778 in P60484 -positive cells not only increases the basal activity of the AR in the absence of androgens , it also markedly sensitizes the AR activation by low levels of androgens or nonandrogenic factors such as interleukin-6 . Q12778 -mediated inhibition of the AR is partially attenuated by the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor trichostatin A . Accordingly , Q12778 interacts with O15379 as shown by coimmunoprecipitation assays , and cotransfection of cells with Q12778 and O15379 , but not Q13547 and Q92769 , results in a greater inhibition of AR activity than in cells transfected with Q12778 or O15379 individually . Together , our findings define a novel corepressor function of Q12778 in inhibition of androgen-independent activation of the AR . Preclinical safety profile of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) : mechanism of action of its cytotoxic component retained with improved tolerability . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is the first antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) approved for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer . The therapeutic premise of ADCs is based on the hypothesis that targeted delivery of potent cytotoxic drugs to tumors will provide better tolerability and efficacy compared with non-targeted delivery , where poor tolerability can limit efficacious doses . Here , we present results from preclinical studies characterizing the toxicity profile of DB05773 , including limited assessment of unconjugated DM1 . DB05773 binds primate ErbB2 and human P04626 but not the rodent homolog c-neu . Therefore , antigen-dependent and non-antigen-dependent toxicity was evaluated in monkeys and rats , respectively , in both single- and repeat-dose studies ; toxicity of DM1 was assessed in rats only . DB05773 was well tolerated at doses up to 40 mg/kg ( ~4400 μg DM1/m(2) ) and 30 mg/kg ( ~ 6000 μg DM1/m(2) ) in rats and monkeys , respectively . In contrast , DM1 was only tolerated up to 0.2mg/kg ( 1600 μg DM1/m(2) ) . This suggests that at least two-fold higher doses of the cytotoxic agent are tolerated in DB05773 , supporting the premise of ADCs to improve the therapeutic index . In addition , DB05773 and DM1 safety profiles were similar and consistent with the mechanism of action of DM1 ( i.e. , microtubule disruption ) . Findings included hepatic , bone marrow/hematologic ( primarily platelet ) , lymphoid organ , and neuronal toxicities , and increased numbers of cells of epithelial and phagocytic origin in metaphase arrest . These adverse effects did not worsen with chronic dosing in monkeys and are consistent with those reported in DB05773 -treated patients to date . Targeting Q01196 / Q06455 -histone deacetylase repressor complex : a novel mechanism for valproic acid-mediated gene expression and cellular differentiation in Q01196 / Q06455 -positive acute myeloid leukemia cells . In t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , the Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein promotes leukemogenesis by recruiting class I histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) -containing repressor complex to the promoter of Q01196 target genes . Valproic acid ( DB00313 ) , a commonly used antiseizure and mood stabilizer drug , has been shown to cause growth arrest and induce differentiation of malignant cells via HDAC inhibition . DB00313 causes selective proteasomal degradation of Q92769 but not other class I HDACs ( i.e. , HDAC 1 , 3 , and 8 ) . Therefore , we raised the question of whether this drug can effectively target the leukemogenic activity of the Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein that also recruits Q13547 , a key regulator of normal and aberrant histone acetylation . We report here that DB00313 treatment disrupts the Q01196 / Q06455 - Q13547 physical interaction , stimulates the global dissociation of Q01196 / Q06455 - Q13547 complex from the promoter of Q01196 / Q06455 target genes , and induces relocation of both Q01196 / Q06455 and Q13547 protein from nuclear to perinuclear region . Furthermore , we show that mechanistically these effects associate with a significant inhibition of HDAC activity , histone H3 and H4 hyperacetylation , and recruitment of RNA polymerase II , leading to transcriptional reactivation of target genes ( i.e. , P08700 ) otherwise silenced by Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein . Ultimately , these pharmacological effects resulted in significant antileukemic activity mediated by partial cell differentiation and caspase-dependent apoptosis . Taken together , these data support the notion that DB00313 might effectively target Q01196 / Q06455 -driven leukemogenesis through disruption of aberrant Q13547 function and that DB00313 should be integrated in novel therapeutic approaches for Q01196 / Q06455 -positive AML . Emerging therapeutic targets in bladder cancer . Treatment of muscle invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma ( BCa ) remains a major challenge . Comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors and identification of driver mutations may reveal new therapeutic targets . This manuscript discusses relevant molecular drivers of the malignant phenotype and agents with therapeutic potential in BCa . Small molecule pan-FGFR inhibitors have shown encouraging efficacy and safety results especially among patients with activating FGFR mutations or translocations . P42345 inhibitors for patients with Q92574 mutations and concomitant targeting of PI3K and MEK represent strategies to block PI3K/AKT/ P42345 pathway . Encouraging preclinical results with ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) exemplifies a new potential treatment for P04626 -positive BCa along with innovative bispecific antibodies . Inhibitors of cell cycle regulators ( aurora kinase , polo-like kinase 1 , and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 ) are being investigated in combination with chemotherapy . Early results of clinical studies with anti- P16410 and anti- Q9NZQ7 are propelling immune modulating drugs to the forefront of emerging treatments for BCa . Collectively , these novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies hold promise to improve the outcome of patients afflicted with this malignancy . Enhanced antitumor activity of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) in combination with pertuzumab in a P04626 -positive gastric cancer model . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -targeted therapy by trastuzumab has become increasingly important for treating P04626 -positive cancers , and trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) is expected to serve as an effective alternative to trastuzumab . DB06366 , a P04626 dimerization inhibitor , showed prolonged progression-free survival when used with trastuzumab for P04626 -positive breast cancer . In this study , we investigated the effect of combining DB05773 and pertuzumab on xenografted gastric tumors . DB05773 as a single agent showed significant antitumor activity in all the three P04626 -high expression tumor models tested ( NCI-N87 , P35240 and 4-1ST ) but was ineffective against two P04626 -low expression tumors ( SNU-16 and MKN-28 ) . Using the DB05773 -sensitive NCI-N87 model , the combination efficacy of DB05773 and pertuzumab was elucidated . The combination induced significant tumor regression , whereas DB05773 or pertuzumab alone did not . In cultured NCI-N87 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) or heregulin-α , concomitant treatment of DB05773 and pertuzumab significantly inhibited proliferation and increased caspase 3/7 activity compared to either agent alone . Only the combination significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of P00533 or P21860 , and its downstream factor AKT . Suppressed P21860 phosphorylation by the combination was also seen in the NCI-N87 xenografted tumors . Compared to single agent treatments , the combination treatment significantly enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) against NCI-N87 cells . These findings suggest that DB05773 in combination with pertuzumab shows significant antitumor activity by increasing AKT signal inhibition and ADCC in P04626 -positive gastric cancers . New therapies in P04626 -positive breast cancer : a major step towards a cure of the disease ? Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) predicts a poor prognosis in metastatic breast cancer . While the introduction of P04626 -targeted therapies , such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib , has significantly improved outcomes in P04626 + breast cancer compared with previously available therapies , use of these targeted therapies is often limited by the development of drug resistance and tolerability issues . These limitations create the need for further development and investigation of new targeted therapies that show potent and selective inhibition of these targets or closely connected molecular pathways . Recently , several agents have demonstrated promising activity in P04626 + metastatic breast cancer , either as monotherapy or in combination therapy , including the tyrosine-kinase inhibitors neratinib ( HKI-272 ) and afatinib ( BIBW-2992 ) and the anti- P04626 monoclonal antibodies pertuzumab and trastuzumab-DM1 ( DB05773 ) . Agents that target other molecular pathways , such as the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor , mammalian target of rapamycin , P19957 -kinases , insulin-like growth factor ( IGFR ) , HSP-90 , and other kinases also have potential , in combination with anti- P04626 and/or other systemic therapies , to be active in this subtype of breast cancer . Innovative clinical studies are required in well-characterized patient populations to define the true clinical value of these emerging new approaches . Responses to subsequent anti- P04626 therapy after treatment with trastuzumab-DM1 in women with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . BACKGROUND : Women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) can respond to multiple lines of anti- P04626 therapy . It is unknown whether these patients will derive further clinical benefit following treatment with trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 ( DB05773 ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : We retrospectively identified P04626 -positive MBC patients treated with DB05773 and characterized outcomes during subsequent lines of anti- P04626 therapy . Response was determined by a blinded radiology review . Time-dependent analyses were carried out using Kaplan-Meier estimates . RESULTS : We identified 23 patients treated with single-agent DB05773 and report on the 20 patients who discontinued protocol therapy . All patients received trastuzumab-based metastatic therapy before initiation of DB05773 [ median 7 regimens ( range 3-14 ) ] . Of these 20 patients , 75 % ( 15 of 20 ) received further therapy with or without anti- P04626 agents after discontinuing DB05773 . Partial response to either first- or second-subsequent line(s) of therapy was seen in 5 of 15 ( 33 % ) treated patients , including 33 % ( 4 of 12 ) who received a regimen containing trastuzumab and/or lapatinib . Median durations of therapy to first- and second-subsequent regimens after DB05773 were 5.5 and 6.4 months , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : In heavily pretreated P04626 -positive MBC patients , prior exposure to DB05773 does not exhaust the potential benefit of ongoing anti- P04626 therapy with trastuzumab- and/or lapatinib-based regimens . P04626 -positive breast cancer : beyond trastuzumab . The outlook for patients with P04626 -positive breast cancer was revolutionized by the development of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) , a humanized murine monoclonal antibody . Use of this agent led to improved overall survival when it was added to chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer . Improved understanding of mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab has facilitated the development of novel agents for P04626 -positive breast cancer , and also resulted in superior outcomes when added to chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting . This review explores the use of several such agents , including lapatinib ( DB01259 ) , HSP90 inhibitors , DB05773 , and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Emerging data from trials of these agents indicate that the P04626 pathway remains a valid therapeutic target following disease progression on trastuzumab , and suggest a promising role for combined P04626 blockade with two or more agents . Potential mechanisms for thrombocytopenia development with trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) . PURPOSE : DB00072 -emtansine ( DB05773 ) is an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) comprising the cytotoxic agent DM1 conjugated to trastuzumab with a stable linker . Thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in the phase I study , and grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia occurred in up to 13 % of patients receiving DB05773 in phase III studies . We investigated the mechanism of DB05773 -induced thrombocytopenia . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The effect of DB05773 on platelet function was measured by aggregometry , and by flow cytometry to detect the markers of activation . The effect of DB05773 on differentiation and maturation of megakaryocytes ( MK ) from human hematopoietic stem cells was assessed by flow cytometry and microscopy . Binding , uptake , and catabolism of DB05773 in MKs , were assessed by various techniques including fluorescence microscopy , scintigraphy to detect T-[H(3)]-DM1 and (125)I- DB05773 , and mass spectrometry . The role of FcγRIIa was assessed using blocking antibodies and mutant constructs of trastuzumab that do not bind FcγR . RESULTS : DB05773 had no direct effect on platelet activation and aggregation , but it did markedly inhibit MK differentiation via a cytotoxic effect . Inhibition occurred with DM1-containing ADCs but not with trastuzumab demonstrating a role for DM1 . MKs internalized these ADCs in a P04626 -independent , FcγRIIa-dependent manner , resulting in intracellular release of DM1 . Binding and internalization of DB05773 diminished as MKs matured ; however , prolonged exposure of mature MKs to DB05773 resulted in a disrupted cytoskeletal structure . CONCLUSIONS : These data support the hypothesis that DB05773 -induced thrombocytopenia is mediated in large part by DM1-induced impairment of MK differentiation , with a less pronounced effect on mature MKs . DB05773 , a novel antibody-drug conjugate , is highly effective against uterine and ovarian carcinosarcomas overexpressing P04626 . Ovarian and uterine carcinosarcoma ( CS ) are characterized by their aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis . We evaluated the efficacy of trastuzumab-emtansine ( DB05773 ) , against primary P04626 positive and P04626 negative CS cell lines in vitro and in vivo . Eight primary CS cell lines were evaluated for P04626 amplification and protein expression by fluorescence in situ hybridization , immunohistochemistry , flow cytometry and qRT-PCR . Sensitivity to DB05773 -induced antibody-dependent-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) was evaluated in 4-h-chromium-release-assays . DB05773 cytostatic and apoptotic activities were evaluated using flow cytometry based proliferation assays . In vivo activity of DB05773 was also evaluated . P04626 protein overexpression and gene amplification were detected in 25 % ( 2/8 ) of the primary CS cell lines . DB05773 and T were similarly effective in inducing strong ADCC against CS overexpressing P04626 at 3+ levels . In contrast , DB05773 was dramatically more effective than T in inhibiting cell proliferation ( P < 0.0001 ) and in inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in the P04626 expressing cell lines ( shift of G2/M : mean ± SEM from 14.87 ± 1.23 to 66.57 ± 4.56 % , P < 0.0001 ) . Importantly , DB05773 was highly active at reducing tumor formation in vivo in CS xenografts overexpressing P04626 ( P = 0.0001 and P < 0.0001 compared to T and vehicle respectively ) with a significantly longer survival when compared to T and vehicle mice ( P = 0.008 and P = 0.0001 respectively ) . DB05773 may represent a novel treatment option for the subset of P04626 positive CS patients with disease refractory to chemotherapy . Therapeutic targeting of P04626 in breast cancer : understanding resistance in the laboratory and combating it in the clinic . P04626 gene amplification occurs in about one quarter of breast carcinomas ( BCs ) and identifies a distinct clinical subset of BC . The introduction in the clinic of DB00072 , a humanized monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) directed to the P04626 extracellular domain , has had a great impact on the therapeutic management of P04626 + BC . Yet , not all patients respond to DB00072 and resistance develops also among patients that initially benefit from DB00072 -based regimens . Pre-clinical studies have discovered several mechanisms through which tumor cells may escape from DB00072 -mediated P04626 inhibition . These include rewiring of the ErbB signaling network , loss of P04626 expression , expression of P04626 isoforms refractory to DB00072 inhibition , vicarious signaling by non-ErbB tyrosine kinases and constitutive activation of downstream signaling routes , such as the PI3K pathway . While the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to establishing DB00072 resistance in the clinical setting is not fully understood , much attention has been focused on abating resistance by achieving complete blockade of P04626 -containing dimers . This approach , propelled by the development of novel anti- P04626 therapeutics , has led to the recent approval of DB01259 , DB06366 and DB05773 as additional anti- P04626 therapeutics in BC . However , full success is far from being achieved and resistance to P04626 targeting remains a relevant problem in the clinical management of BC . Herein , we provide an overview of biological and molecular bases underpinning resistance to P04626 therapeutics in BC , discuss outstanding issues in the field of P04626 therapeutic targeting and elaborate on future directions of translational research on P04626 + breast cancer . Serotonergic mechanisms in human allergic contact dermatitis . Expression of serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-HT ) , 5-HT receptors 1A ( 5-HT1AR ) and 2A , and serotonin transporter protein ( P31645 ) was studied in positive epicutaneous reactions to nickel sulphate in nickel-allergic patients , at 72 h post-challenge with the antigen . In addition , the effects of 5-HT2AR agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine ( DOI ) , and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) citalopram and fluoxetine , were tested on nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from nickel-allergic patients , regarding their proliferation and interleukin ( IL ) -2 production , as well as the effect of these SSRIs on a murine Langerhans ' cell-like line ( XS52 ) , regarding its IL-1beta production . Serotonin-positive platelets were increased in the inflamed skin compared with control skin . A decrease ( p < 0.01 ) in 5-HT1AR-positive mononuclear cells was evident in the eczematous skin compared with control skin , whereas 5-HT2AR- and P31645 -positive cells were increased ( p < 0.001 for both ) in the eczematous skin . Treatment of nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 5x10(-5) mol/l of DOI inhibited ( p < 0.01 ) the proliferation of nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells , while no effect was found regarding P60568 production . DB00215 at 10(-6) mol/l tended to inhibit the production of IL-1beta by the XS52 cell line . These results indicate the implication of the serotonergic system in the contact allergic reaction . Expression of P20839 and P12268 after transplantation and initiation of immunosuppression . BACKGROUND : DB01024 ( DB00603 ) mediates immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) . Induction of IMPDH activity has been observed in whole blood and erythrocyte samples during immunosuppressive therapy . Information concerning the mechanisms for increased IMPDH activity is limited and the potential implications of induction have been debated . METHODS : Whole blood , P01730 + cell , and reticulocyte samples were collected from 30 renal transplant patients pre- and posttransplantation . The expressions of two IMPDH isoforms , type 1 and 2 , were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and quantified using a housekeeping gene index . The IMPDH activity was determined by ultraviolet high-performance liquid chromatography . RESULTS : Transplantation and the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy was associated with increased P20839 ( 50-88 % , P < 0.0005 ) and decreased P12268 ( 42-56 % , P < 0.0005 ) expression . In P01730 + cells , however , P12268 increased ( 15 % , P=0.009 ) . These changes are probably related to glucocorticoid effects . Two weeks posttransplant , DB00603 -treated patients displayed elevated P20839 and 2 in reticulocytes , suggesting enzyme induction in these cells during prolonged DB00603 therapy . Patients with acute rejection during follow-up demonstrated higher P12268 expression in P01730 + cells pretransplant than nonrejecting patients ( median expression 1.26 vs. 0.87 respectively , P=0.017 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Knowledge of changes in P20839 and 2 expression after transplantation and initiation of immunosuppression is important considering the action of DB00603 on IMPDH and the potential for pharmacodynamic monitoring of DB00603 by measuring IMPDH activity . The expression of P12268 in P01730 + cells pretransplant may be an indicator of immune activation . DB05773 : a P04626 -positive targeted antibody-drug conjugate . OBJECTIVE : To review the pharmacology , pharmacokinetics , efficacy , adverse effects , drug-drug interactions , dosage and administration , and formulary considerations for ado-trastuzumab emtansine . DATA SOURCES : Sources of information were identified through a PubMed search ( 1966 to June 2014 ) using the key terms ado-trastuzumab emtansine , trastuzumab-DM1 , trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 , and DB05773 . Other information was obtained from clinicaltrials.gov , product labeling , and press releases . STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION : All English-language clinical trials and abstracts evaluating ado-trastuzumab emtansine in humans were reviewed for inclusion . DATA SYNTHESIS : Overexpression or amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) occurs in approximately 20 % of breast cancers and is associated with more aggressive tumors and poorer prognosis in the absence of treatment . Although effective therapies for the initial management of P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) exist , many patients will experience disease progression . Most second-line therapies are associated with either significant toxicities or limited improvements in overall survival ( OS ) . DB05773 is a P04626 -positive directed antibody drug conjugate ( ADC ) approved in February 2013 . In phase III clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of ado-trastuzumab emtansine with lapatinib-capecitabine or physician 's choice , ado-trastuzumab emtansine had a better tolerability profile and improved progression-free survival compared with lapatinib-capecitabine or physician 's choice and increased OS compared with lapatinib-capecitabine . CONCLUSION : DB05773 is a novel ADC effective for P04626 -positive MBC in patients previously treated with trastuzumab , lapatinib , and a taxane . Further studies will determine its use in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting and in combination with pertuzumab . Characterization of P04626 status by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) and immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . The use of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( P04626 ) gene amplification and overexpression as a molecular predictive marker has become critically important for proper selection of breast cancer patients for treatment with targeted therapeutic agents such as trastuzumab , lapatinib , pertuzumab , and DB05773 . A high level of sensitivity and specificity of molecular tests for this alteration is desirable . The American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathology have jointly established consensus guidelines to standardize characterization of this alteration in breast cancers . This chapter provides a brief overview of pre-analytic and analytical processing of breast specimens as well as subsequent molecular evaluation for P04626 status . Treating metastatic breast cancer with systemic chemotherapies : current trends and future perspectives . Treatment selection for metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) is guided by multiple factors , most importantly hormone receptor ( HR ) or P04626 expression , treatment history , and prognostic factors such as short disease-free interval , presence of visceral metastases , performance status , and degree of symptoms . Chemotherapy is indicated as initial therapy for patients with HR-negative disease and following failure of hormonal therapies in HR-positive disease . Patients treated with an anthracycline or a taxane in early-stage settings may no longer be candidates for those drugs in MBC , thus underscoring the need for alternative options . Sequential single-agent therapy or combination therapy are viable strategies . Trials have shown that ixabepilone plus capecitabine significantly improves progression-free survival compared with capecitabine alone in anthracycline- or taxane-pretreated or -resistant patients , and single-agent eribulin improves survival compared with the physician 's choice of treatment in patients treated previously with at least two regimens for MBC . Regardless of the regimen , proactive management to detect treatment-related adverse events in a timely manner remains important for ensuring effective delivery of treatment . Many promising investigational agents are in development , including DB05773 ( trastuzumab emtansine ) and pertuzumab for P04626 -positive disease , as well as P09874 ( poly [ adenosine diphosphate ribose ] polymerase-1 ) inhibitors and cetuximab for triple-negative disease . In addition , new options for the treatment of MBC following failure of an anthracycline and a taxane promise to improve patient outcomes . Nurses should remain vigilant for adverse events and remember that the goal of treatment remains control of the disease and palliation . Nursing perspectives on trastuzumab emtansine for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer . Increased understanding of the molecular composition of breast cancer tumors has led to the development of targeted anticancer agents . Novel therapies directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) in breast cancer have been developed . One such agent , trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) , is an antibody drug conjugate that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of women with P04626 -positive breast cancer . Phase I and II studies have determined a maximum tolerated dose , and several phase Ib/II , II , and III studies have shown improved tolerability and efficacy compared with the combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy . The most concerning grade 3 or higher adverse events associated with DB05773 include thrombocytopenia and transaminitis . To ensure that these adverse events do not delay or interrupt treatment , oncology nurses need to familiarize themselves with these risks and their management . This article reviews the clinical development of DB05773 and its usage , with a focus on the nurse 's role in preventing and managing adverse events associated with DB05773 therapy . Triple negative breast cancer : therapeutic and prognostic implications . Triple negative breast cancers ( TNBC ) lack oestrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , nor over-express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) . Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that women diagnosed with TNBC manifest a significantly different set of clinic-pathologic features and risk factors when compared to women with other subtypes of breast cancer . They are associated with poor prognosis , as defined by low five-year survival . To date many studies have examined the utility of traditional chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with TNBC and have confirmed the benefits of these agents in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings . Targeted therapy options involving P09874 and P00533 inhibition , are currently in different phases of development and will hopefully change the paradigm of how patients with TNBC are treated . The present commentary aims to summarize the latest findings on chemotherapy in the treatment of TNBC in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting and explore the ongoing development of newer targeted agents . A mechanistic pharmacokinetic model elucidating the disposition of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) , an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) for treatment of metastatic breast cancer . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) therapeutic for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive cancers . The DB05773 dose product contains a mixture of drug-to-antibody ratio ( DAR ) moieties whereby the small molecule DM1 is chemically conjugated to trastuzumab antibody . The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) underlying this system and other ADCs are complex and have not been elucidated . Accordingly , we have developed two PK modeling approaches from preclinical data to conceptualize and understand DB05773 PK , to quantify rates of DM1 deconjugation , and to elucidate the link between trastuzumab , DB05773 , and DAR measurements . Preclinical data included PK studies in rats ( n = 34 ) and cynomolgus monkeys ( n = 18 ) at doses ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg and in vitro plasma stability . DB05773 and total trastuzumab ( TT ) plasma concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Individual DAR moieties were measured by affinity capture liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry . Two PK modeling approaches were developed for DB05773 using NONMEM 7.2 software : a mechanistic model fit simultaneously to TT and DAR concentrations and a reduced model fit simultaneously to TT and DB05773 concentrations . DAR moieties were well described with a three-compartmental model and DM1 deconjugation in the central compartment . DM1 deconjugated fastest from the more highly loaded trastuzumab molecules ( i.e. , DAR moieties that are ≥3 DM1 per trastuzumab ) . DB05773 clearance ( CL ) was 2-fold faster than TT CL due to deconjugation . The two modeling approaches provide flexibility based on available analytical measurements for DB05773 and a framework for designing ADC studies and PK-pharmacodynamic modeling of ADC efficacy- and toxicity-related endpoints . Alloreactive memory T cells are responsible for the persistence of graft-versus-host disease . Graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) is caused by a donor T cell anti-host reaction that evolves over several weeks to months , suggesting a requirement for persistent alloreactive T cells . Using the C3H.SW anti-C57BL/6 ( B6 ) mouse model of human GVHD directed against minor histocompatibility Ags , we found that donor CD8(+) T cells secreting high levels of P01579 in GVHD B6 mice receiving C3H.SW naive CD8(+) T cells peaked by day 14 , declined by day 28 after transplantation , and persisted thereafter , corresponding to the kinetics of a memory T cell response . Donor CD8(+) T cells recovered on day 42 after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation expressed the phenotype of P16070 (high)CD122(high)CD25(low) , were able to homeostatically survive in response to P60568 , P13232 , and P40933 and rapidly proliferated upon restimulation with host dendritic cells . Both allogeneic effector memory ( P16070 (high)CD62L(low) ) and central memory ( P16070 (high)CD62L(high) ) CD8(+) T cells were identified in B6 mice with ongoing GVHD , with effector memory CD8(+) T cells as the dominant ( > 80 % ) population . Administration of these allogeneic memory CD8(+) T cells into secondary B6 recipients caused virulent GVHD . A similar allogeneic memory P01730 (+) T cell population with the ability to mediate persistent GVHD was also identified in BALB/b mice receiving minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched B6 T cell-replete bone marrow transplantation . These results indicate that allogeneic memory T cells are generated in vivo during GVH reactions and are able to cause GVHD , resulting in persistent host tissue injury . Thus , in vivo blockade of both alloreactive effector and memory T cell-mediated host tissue injury may prove to be valuable for GVHD prevention and treatment . Poly( DB02059 )polymerase-1 signalling of the DNA damage induced by P11387 poison in D54(p53wt) and U251(p53mut) glioblastoma cell lines . Glioblastomas are widely characterised by the mutation of the p53 gene and p53 disruption sensitizes glioblastoma cells to P11387 ( TOPO I ) inhibitor-mediated apoptosis . We investigated the effects of combined treatments with the P11387 inhibitor DB01030 and the poly( DB02059 )polymerase-1 inhibitor DB02690 in D54(p53wt) and U251(p53mut) glioblastoma cell lines . Analysis of cell growth and cell cycle kinetics showed a synergistic anti-proliferative effect of 10 nM TPT and 10 microM DB02690 and a G2/M block of the cell cycle . We also evaluated , the influence of TPT+/- DB02690 treatment on P09874 and p53 activity . We got evidences of a TPT-dependent increase of P09874 auto-modification level in both the cells . Moreover , in the D54(p53wt) cells we found that in co-treatments DB02690 incremented the TPT-dependent stimulation of p53 transcriptional activity and increased the P38936 nuclear amount . Conversely , in U251(p53mut) cells we found that DB02690 incremented the TPT-dependent apoptosis characterised by P09874 proteolysis . Our findings suggest that the modulation of P09874 can be considered a strategy in the potentiation of the chemotherapeutic action of TOPO I poisons in glioblastoma cells apart from their p53 status . The unexpected effect of cyclosporin A on CD56+CD16- and CD56+CD16+ natural killer cell subpopulations . DB00091 ( Q13216 ) is commonly used to prevent graft-versus-host disease . The influence of Q13216 on T-cell function has been extensively investigated ; however , the effect of Q13216 on natural killer ( NK ) cells is less understood . NK cells were cultured with P60568 and P40933 with and without Q13216 for 1 week . Compared with controls , Q13216 -treated cultures showed fewer CD56(+)CD16(+) P55040 (+) NK cells and a reciprocal increase in CD56(+)CD16(-) P55040 (-) cells . These changes were due mainly to a reduced proliferation of the CD56(dim) NK-cell subpopulation and a relative resistance of CD56(bright) NK cells to Q13216 . Following coculture with K562 targets , Q13216 -exposed NK cells differed from controls and lacked Ca(2+) oscillations , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) dephosphorylation , and NFAT nuclear translocation . NK cells cultured in Q13216 retained cytotoxicity against K562 , Raji , and P55040 ligand-expressing lymphoblastoid cells . NK cells cultured in Q13216 showed increases in O14931 and reductions in O95944 and P26718 . Following IL-12 and Q14116 stimulation , Q13216 -treated NK cells showed more P01579 -producing cells . Using in vitro NK-cell differentiation , progenitor cells gave rise to more CD56(+) P55040 (-) NK cells in the presence of Q13216 than controls . Collectively , these studies show that Q13216 influences NK-cell function and phenotype , which may have important implications for graft-versus-leukemia effects . Systemic treatment of P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer : a systematic review . AIM : We aimed to systematically review and summarize data from the available clinical trials that examined the treatment of P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . METHODS : We reviewed phase 2 and 3 studies in which an anti- P04626 agent was used in one or both arms of the study . While formal meta-analysis was not possible for such a heterogeneous group of trials , resulting forest plots outline some generalizable findings . RESULTS : There is strong evidence that the addition of an anti- P04626 agent to standard chemo- or endocrine therapy improves clinically relevant measurable outcomes . There is also consistent evidence that initial treatment with trastuzumab alone ( and subsequent use of a cytotoxic ) is inferior to the initial combination of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy , and that either DB05773 or dual anti- P04626 agents are superior to single anti- P04626 agent regimens . There is no strong evidence that the use of more than one cytotoxic agent together with an anti- P04626 agent confers any benefit over a single cytotoxic , anti- P04626 combination . CONCLUSION : This review provides a strong evidence base for current clinical practice with a discussion of treatment in the Australian setting . DB05773 ( DB05773 ) retains all the mechanisms of action of trastuzumab and efficiently inhibits growth of lapatinib insensitive breast cancer . DB00072 ( Herceptin(®) ) is currently used as a treatment for patients whose breast tumors overexpress P04626 /ErbB2 . DB05773 ( DB05773 , trastuzumab emtansine ) is designed to combine the clinical benefits of trastuzumab with a potent microtubule-disrupting drug , DM1 ( a maytansine derivative ) . Currently DB05773 is being tested in multiple clinical trials . The mechanisms of action for trastuzumab include inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway , inhibition of HER-2 shedding and Fcγ receptor mediated engagement of immune cells , which may result in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Here we report that DB05773 retains the mechanisms of action of unconjugated trastuzumab and is active against lapatinib resistant cell lines and tumors . P04626 -family signalling mechanisms , clinical implications and targeting in breast cancer . Approximately 20 % of human breast cancers ( BC ) overexpress P04626 protein , and P04626 -positivity is associated with a worse prognosis . Although P04626 -targeted therapies have significantly improved outcomes for P04626 -positive BC patients , resistance to trastuzumab-based therapy remains a clinical problem . In order to better understand resistance to P04626 -targeted therapies in P04626 -positive BC , it is necessary to examine HER family signalling as a whole . An extensive literature search was carried out to critically assess the current knowledge of HER family signalling in P04626 -positive BC and response to P04626 -targeted therapy . Known mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance include reduced receptor-antibody binding ( Q99102 , p95HER2 ) , increased signalling through alternative HER family receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) , altered intracellular signalling involving loss of P60484 , reduced p27kip1 , or increased PI3K/AKT activity and altered signalling via non-HER family RTKs such as P08069 . Emerging strategies to circumvent resistance to P04626 -targeted therapies in P04626 -positive BC include co-targeting P04626 /PI3K , pan-HER family inhibition , and novel therapies such as DB05773 . There is evidence that immunity plays a key role in the efficacy of HER-targeted therapy , and efforts are being made to exploit the immune system in order to improve the efficacy of current anti-HER therapies . With our rapidly expanding understanding of P04626 signalling mechanisms along with the repertoire of HER family and other targeted therapies , it is likely that the near future holds further dramatic improvements to the prognosis of women with P04626 -positive BC . DB00072 emtansine in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer : a review . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : In this review , we aim to update the clinical data of trastuzumab-DM1 ( DB05773 ) in terms of safety and efficacy , and describe ongoing and future trials evaluating its potential role in the management of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive breast cancer . RECENT FINDINGS : DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is an antibody drug conjugate that optimizes delivery of chemotherapy with an anti- P04626 monoclonal antibody . As a conjugate , DB05773 's systemic side effects are significantly minimized due to its targeted delivery by trastuzumab to P04626 -positive cells . Phase I and II studies show that the maximum tolerated dose , and thus the recommended dose for DB05773 , is 3.6 mg/kg given intravenously every 3 weeks . Single arm phase Ib/II , II and a randomized phase II first-line study of DB05773 versus the combination of trastuzumab + docetaxel all showed improved tolerability , and at least equivalent efficacy , compared with our current standard of care . Two randomized phase III registration studies are now active , evaluating this agent in the refractory and first-line P04626 -positive settings . SUMMARY : DB05773 has been shown to be a very promising agent for the targeted delivery of chemotherapy and anti- P04626 monoclonal antibody therapy for patients with metastatic , P04626 -positive breast cancer . DB05773 will likely play a role in the management of patients with advanced and early stage P04626 -positive breast cancer , but this awaits further study . Exposure-response relationship of DB05773 : insight into dose optimization for patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . Exposure-response ( E-R ) analyses for ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 , Kadcyla ) were performed using data from a randomized , active control ( lapatinib plus capecitabine ) trial in patients with human epidermal growth factor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer . Kaplan-Meier survival analyses stratified by DB05773 trough concentration on day 21 of cycle 1 ( Cmin,C1D21 ) were performed for overall survival ( OS ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) . E-R analyses indicated that after adjusting for baseline risk factors , higher DB05773 exposure is associated with improved efficacy . DB05773 -treated patients with Cmin,C1D21 lower than the median value had values of OS and PFS comparable to those of the active control arm . The percentage of patients who received DB05773 dose adjustments was similar across the exposure range and was lower than that of the active control arm . Our findings suggest that there may be an opportunity to optimize Kadcyla dose in the patient subgroup with low DB05773 exposure for improved efficacy with acceptable tolerability . Influence of immunomodulatory drugs on the cytotoxicity induced by monoclonal antibody 17-1A and interleukin-2 . Patients treated with monoclonal antibodies and cytokines for cancer receive often co-medication , which may influence treatment efficacy . Therefore , we investigated with a flowcytometric cytotoxicity assay the effect of several immunomodulatory drugs on antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) , interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) induced cytotoxicity and P60568 -induced-ADCC . We found that dexamethasone markedly inhibited the P60568 induced cytotoxicity and the P60568 -induced-ADCC . DB00904 , a P46098 serotonin receptor antagonist augmented significantly ADCC . Clemastine , a histamine type-2 receptor antagonist augmented the P60568 -induced-ADCC . The P01375 antagonist thalidomide suppressed ADCC whereas pentoxifylline proved to be ineffective . Other tested drugs namely ibuprofen and indomethacin , both prostaglandin E2 antagonists , cimetidine a histamine type-2 receptor antagonist , the opioid pethidine , prostaglandin E2 and histamine exerted minor effects or had no influence on the tested parameters . We conclude that glucocorticosteroids should be avoided with monoclonal antibody and cytokine treatment . According to our in vitro data the other drugs tested did not have a negative impact on cellular cytotoxicity and ADCC . Modeling the efficacy of trastuzumab-DM1 , an antibody drug conjugate , in mice . DB05773 ( DB05773 ) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate under investigation for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer . One challenge in oncologic drug development is determining the optimal dose and treatment schedule . A novel dose regimen-finding strategy was developed for DB05773 using experimental data and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling . To characterize the disposition of DB05773 , pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in athymic nude and beige nude mice . The pharmacokinetics of DB05773 were described well by a two-compartment model . Tumor response data were obtained from single-dose , multiple-dose and time-dose-fractionation studies of DB05773 in animal models of P04626 -positive breast cancer , specifically engineered to be insensitive to trastuzumab . A sequential population-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling approach was developed to describe the anti-tumor activity of DB05773 . A cell-cycle-phase nonspecific tumor cell kill model incorporating transit compartments captured well the features of tumor growth and the activity of DB05773 . Key findings of the model were that tumor cell growth rate played a significant role in the sensitivity of tumors to DB05773 ; anti-tumor activity was schedule independent ; and tumor response was linked to the ratio of exposure to a concentration required for tumor stasis . DB00072 emtansine in the treatment of P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer in Japanese patients . Anti- P04626 agents , such as trastuzumab , lapatinib , trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) , and pertuzumab , are standard agents in the treatment of breast cancer overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) . DB00072 is the first approved P04626 -targeted agent . Subsequent developments include agents with different mechanisms . In this paper , we review the results of clinical trials of DB05773 , a new anti- P04626 agent , with a focus on Japanese patients with breast cancer . On the basis of results from a Phase I study ( JO22591 ) , the maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for both Japanese and western patients . In a Phase II study ( JO22997 ) , the overall response rate was 38.4 % ( 90 % confidence interval 28.8-48.6 ) . DB05773 was well tolerated in Japanese patients ; however , the incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was higher than that observed in earlier western studies , but was not associated with clinically important symptoms . Pharmacokinetic parameters for DB05773 and its metabolites were consistent with those reported previously from a Phase I or II study in non-Japanese patients , and the data obtained showed no suggestion of ethnic differences . Several Phase III studies of DB05773 are ongoing throughout the world , including in Japanese patients with breast cancer . The adjuvant treatment of P04626 -positive breast cancer . About 15-20 % of patients with early stage breast cancer present with tumors that have overexpression or amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) gene . Before 2005 , these individuals had an increased risk of recurrence and death , but since then their outcomes have substantially improved with the adoption in most countries of adjuvant trastuzumab as a standard component of therapy for P04626 -positive early-stage breast cancer . Consequently , access to high-quality and accurate P04626 testing methods is critical to accurately determine P04626 status , guide treatment decisions , and ultimately improve clinical outcomes . In 2012 , the humanized monoclonal anti-HER antibody trastuzumab was the only approved P04626 -targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting . Data from the first generation of trials combining it with various chemotherapy regimens showed significant improvements in disease-free and overall survival ( DFS/OS ) . Based on results from five randomized clinical trials , a trastuzumab-containing regimen for up to 1 year is now considered standard for all patients with P04626 -positive tumors larger than 1 cm in size who would have fulfilled eligibility to those studies , and this recommendation is sometimes extended to patients with stage I tumors greater than 0.5 cm ( T1b ) . Second generation adjuvant studies with other P04626 -targeted agents like lapatinib and pertuzumab are ongoing , and newer drugs like DB05773 and neratinib are being actively tested in the metastatic setting . A case study of acenocoumarol sensitivity and genotype-phenotype discordancy explained by combinations of polymorphisms in Q9BQB6 and P11712 . To determine the cause of a genotype-phenotype discordancy for acenocoumarol sensitivity . Methods A patient , highly sensitive to acenocoumarol , and previously determined to carry only a single P11712 *3 allele , was genotyped for additional functionally defective alleles in the P11712 and Q9BQB6 genes . Family members were also analyzed to trace the pedigree . Results The acenocoumarol-sensitive patient was found to possess , in addition to P11712 *3 allele , a P11712 *11 allele and the Q9BQB6 AA diplotype which were all traced back through the parental lines . Conclusions DB01418 sensitivity in this subject is the consequence of inheritance of multiple functionally defective alleles in both the P11712 and Q9BQB6 genes . The study provides additional data in support of diminished P11712 activity due to the presence of the rare *11 allele . Population pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) , a P04626 -targeted antibody-drug conjugate , in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer : clinical implications of the effect of covariates . PURPOSE : DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab linked to DM1 , a highly potent cytotoxic agent . A population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis was performed to estimate typical values and interindividual variability of DB05773 PK parameters and the effects of clinically relevant covariates . METHODS : Serum samples were collected from 671 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) who received single-agent DB05773 in five phase I to phase III studies . Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with the first-order conditional estimation method was used . RESULTS : A linear two-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment described DB05773 PKs in the clinical dose range . DB05773 elimination clearance was 0.676 L/day , volume of distribution in the central compartment ( V c ) was 3.127 L , and terminal elimination half-life was 3.94 days . Age , race , region , and renal function did not influence DB05773 PK . Given the low-to-moderate effect of all statistically significant covariates on DB05773 exposure , none of these covariates is expected to result in a clinically meaningful change in DB05773 exposure . CONCLUSIONS : DB05773 PK properties are consistent and predictable in patients . A further refinement of dose based on baseline covariates other than body weight for the current 3.6 mg/kg regimen would not yield clinically meaningful reductions in interindividual PK variability in patients with MBC . Clinical implications of pathophysiological and demographic covariates on the population pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine , a P04626 -targeted antibody-drug conjugate , in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is a P04626 -targeted antibody-drug conjugate in development for treatment of P04626 -positive cancers . DB05773 has been tested as a single agent in a phase I and 2 phase II studies of patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) , with the maximum tolerated dose established at 3.6 mg/kg intravenously for every-3-week dosing . The authors present results from the population pharmacokinetics analysis for DB05773 . Population pharmacokinetics for DB05773 were characterized using a clinical database of 273 patients from the 3 studies . Pharmacokinetics was best described by a linear 2-compartment model . Population estimates ( interindividual variability [ IIV ] ) for pharmacokinetic parameters were clearance , 0.7 L/d ( 21.0 % ) ; central compartment volume ( V(c) ) , 3.33 L ( 13.2 % ) ; peripheral compartment volume ( V(p) ) , 0.89 L ( 50.4 % ) ; and intercompartmental clearance , 0.78 L/d . Body weight , albumin , tumor burden , and aspartate aminotransferase levels were identified as statistically significant covariates accounting for interindividual variability in DB05773 pharmacokinetics , with body weight having a greater effect on IIV of clearance and V(c) than other covariates . DB05773 exposure was relatively consistent across the weight range following body weight-based dosing . This analysis suggests no further DB05773 dose adjustments are necessary in heavily pretreated patients with MBC . Targeting the P04626 receptor in metastatic breast cancer . The advent of targeted therapies has revolutionized the treatment of certain types of cancer . Identification of molecular targets on cancer cells has led to the design of novel drugs , which either used as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy , has prolonged survival in metastatic disease , or contributed to curative treatment in the adjuvant setting . A literature review was conducted to identify and present current knowledge on the molecular function of the P04626 receptor , its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and anti- P04626 targeted drugs in use or under development . Many molecular targets have been identified in breast cancer , with the HER family of receptors being the ones most extensively studied . DB00072 and lapatinib target the P04626 receptor and are approved drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer . Several other targeted agents , including DB05773 , pertuzumab , neratinib , afatinib and ertumaxomab , are currently being tested in vivo as well as in clinical studies . The use of targeted therapies in metastatic breast cancer has improved prognosis , increased survival and dramatically changed the way we treat breast cancer patients today . Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of trastuzumab emtansine in Japanese patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . OBJECTIVE : DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) , an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the cytotoxic agent DM1 conjugated to trastuzumab via a stable thioether linker , has shown clinical activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients . This study evaluated the maximum tolerated dose , toxicity and pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine in Japanese breast cancer patients . METHODS : Inoperable advanced or recurrent human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer patients were administered trastuzumab emtansine intravenously at a dose of 1.8 , 2.4 or 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks . The maximum tolerated dose was estimated using the continual reassessment method . RESULTS : This study enrolled 10 patients who were administered trastuzumab emtansine for a median of seven cycles . The dose-limiting toxicity was Grade 3 elevation of aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase at the 2.4 mg/kg dose level . The maximum tolerated dose was estimated to be 3.6 mg/kg because at the point when dose-limiting toxicity was evaluable in 10 patients , the probability of dose-limiting toxicity estimated using the continual reassessment method was closest to 25 % at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg and this was unchanged by the results for patients enrolled after that . The most frequent adverse events were nausea , arthralgia , fever , fatigue and decreased appetite . Adverse events were generally tolerable . The maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve increased linearly with the dose . CONCLUSIONS : DB00072 emtansine up to 3.6 mg/kg was well tolerated by Japanese breast cancer patients . Although thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity tended to be more severe than was seen in Western patients in previous trastuzumab emtansine trials , those adverse events recovered without special supportive treatment . Targeting of T lymphocytes to Neu/ P04626 -expressing cells using chimeric single chain Fv receptors . Cell surface molecules essential for the transformed phenotype or growth of malignant cells are attractive targets for anticancer immunotherapy . Antibodies specific to Neu/ P04626 , a human adenocarcinoma-associated growth factor receptor , were demonstrated to have tumor-inhibitory capacity . Yet , the inefficient accessibility of antibodies to solid tumors limits their clinical use . To redirect effector lymphocytes to adenocarcinomas , we constructed and functionally expressed in T cells chimeric single chain receptor genes incorporating both the Ag-binding domain of anti-Neu/ P04626 antibodies and the zeta-signal-transducing subunit of the TCR/CD3 complex or the gamma-signal-transducing subunit of the Ig Fc receptor complex . Surface expression of the anti-Neu/ P04626 chimeric genes in cytotoxic T cell hybridomas endowed them with specific Neu/ P04626 recognition enabling their activation for P60568 production and lysis of transformed cells overexpressing Neu/ P04626 . These chimeric genes hold promise for the immunotherapy of cancer . DB00072 emtansine in breast cancer . INTRODUCTION : DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -targeted antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) composed of trastuzumab , a stable linker ( MCC ) , and the cytotoxic agent DM1 ( derivative of maytansine ) . Administration of DB05773 leads to limited systemic exposure of free DM1 , with no evidence of DM1 accumulation after repeated dosing . AREAS COVERED : Phase I and Phase II clinical trials with DB05773 as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel , docetaxel , and pertuzumab have shown substantial clinical activity and a favorable safety profile . A randomized , open-label , first-line trial comparing trastuzumab and docetaxel with single agent DB05773 showed a significant improved progression-free survival for DB05773 . EXPERT OPINION : DB05773 has successfully completed second-line Phase III development for advanced P04626 -positive breast cancer . The Phase III EMILIA study demonstrated an overall survival benefit for DB05773 compared to the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine in taxane-trastuzumab pretreated patients . DB05773 may offer delivery on a personalized basis of very potent cytotoxic agents in a cellular selective manner . DB05773 : a clinical update of the novel antibody-drug conjugate for P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer . DB00072 is a monoclonal antibody targeted against the P04626 tyrosine kinase receptor . Although trastuzumab is a very active agent in P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer , the majority of patients with metastatic P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer who initially respond to trastuzumab develop resistance within 1 year of initiation of treatment and , in the adjuvant setting , progress despite trastuzumab-based therapy . The antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-DM1 ( DB05773 ) was designed to combine the biological activity of trastuzumab with the targeted delivery of a highly potent antimicrotubule agent , DM1 ( N-methyl-N-[3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl]-l-alanine ester of maytansinol ) , a maytansine derivative , to P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer cells . DB05773 is the first antibody-drug conjugate with a nonreducible thioether linker in clinical trials . Phase I and II clinical trials of DB05773 as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel , docetaxel and pertuzumab have shown clinical activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . Two randomized phase III trials of DB05773 are awaiting final results ; the EMILIA trial is evaluating DB05773 compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine , and early positive results have been reported . The MARIANNE trial is evaluating DB05773 plus placebo versus DB05773 plus pertuzumab versus trastuzumab plus a taxane . Here , we summarize evidence from clinical studies and discuss the potential clinical implications of DB05773 . Local immunotherapy of glioma patients with a combination of 2 bispecific antibody fragments and resting autologous lymphocytes : evidence for in situ t-cell activation and therapeutic efficacy . After adoptive transfer of pre-activated lymphocytes into the operation cavity of glioma patients , tumor regression and improved survival have been reported in some patients . Results were most impressive when bispecific antibodies with tumor x CD3 specificity were also applied . In this study , we attempted to avoid time-consuming pre-activation procedures for adoptively transferred cells by using a combination of bispecific antibodies directed to the P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) on tumor cells and to CD3 and P10747 on T cells . Eleven patients with high-grade malignant glioma received 3 injections of 2 bispecific antibody fragments ( P00533 x CD3 and P00533 x P10747 ) together with freshly isolated autologous lymphocytes via an Ommaya reservoir . Intracavitary fluid aspirated during immunotherapy was examined for markers of T-cell activation . Increased levels of soluble P60568 receptor and P01375 were detected in the intracavitary fluid of all patients tested . Two of the 11 treated patients experienced a beneficial response to therapy as defined by a transient contrast enhancement in subsequent Q9BWK5 scans and prolonged survival . Side effects were transient and consisted of fever , nausea , headache and aggravation of pre-existing neurologic deficits . These adverse effects were most likely due to the antibody construct containing anti-CD3 specificity . Two patients developed cerebral edema and required steroid treatment . Influence of a 3-day regimen of azithromycin on the disposition kinetics of cyclosporine A in stable renal transplant patients . Some macrolide antibiotics have been shown to produce significant drug-drug interactions through the inhibition of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes . In renal transplant patients these interactions pose potentially serious problems for the safe administration of cyclosporine A ( Q13216 ) , a substrate of P08684 . The effects of azithromycin on Q13216 disposition kinetics were evaluated in eight stable renal transplant patients . Patients had been stabilized on individualized doses of Q13216 which remained unchanged throughout the study . DB00207 was administered for 3 days . Baseline measurements of Q13216 disposition kinetics were taken prior to azithromycin treatment ( study day 2 ) and after 3 days ( study day 5 ) of azithromycin treatment ( 500mg/day , orally ) . The key parameters of interest were the area under the Q13216 blood concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) measured for 24h after the morning dose of Q13216 on both days 2 and 5 , and the C(max) values of Q13216 . The geometric mean ratios ( GMRs ) of those parameters ( day 5/day 2 ) and their 90 % confidence intervals ( 90 % CI ) were 107 ( 98,116 ) and 119 ( 104,136 ) , respectively . The 7 % increase in exposure level and 19 % increase in peak plasma concentration are not likely to be clinically significant . It is concluded that azithromycin ( 500mg/dayx3 days ) does not alter the disposition kinetics of Q13216 in a clinically significant way , and that Q13216 dosage adjustments are not warranted in renal transplant patients taking these two drugs together . Why your preferred targeted drugs may become unaffordable . DB00072 , a monoclonal antibody directed at the P04626 receptor , is one of the most impressive targeted drugs developed in the last two decades . Indeed , when given in conjunction with chemotherapy , it improves the survival of women with P04626 positive breast cancer , both in advanced and in early disease . Its optimal duration , however , is poorly defined in both settings with a significant economic impact in the adjuvant setting where the drug is arbitrarily given for 1 year . This article reviews current attempts at shortening this treatment duration , emphasizing the likelihood of inconclusive results and , therefore , the need to investigate this important variable as part of the initial pivotal trials and with the support of public health systems . Failure to do so has major consequences on treatment affordability . Ongoing adjuvant trials of dual P04626 blockade , using trastuzumab in combination with a second anti- P04626 agent , and trials of the antibody-drug conjugate DB05773 ( trastuzumab-emtansine ) have to all be designed with 12 months of targeted therapy . DB00072 emtansine : a unique antibody-drug conjugate in development for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive cancer . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is a human epidermal growth factor receptor ( P04626 ) -targeted antibody-drug conjugate , composed of trastuzumab , a stable thioether linker , and the potent cytotoxic agent DM1 ( derivative of maytansine ) , in phase III development for P04626 -positive cancer . Extensive analysis of DB05773 in preclinical studies has shown that DB05773 combines the distinct mechanisms of action of both DM1 and trastuzumab , and has antitumor activity in trastuzumab- and lapatinib-refractory experimental models . Clinically , DB05773 has a consistent pharmacokinetics profile and minimal systemic exposure to free DM1 , with no evidence of DM1 accumulation following repeated DB05773 doses . Although a few covariates were shown to affect interindividual variability in DB05773 exposure and clearance in population-pharmacokinetics analyses , the magnitude of their effect on DB05773 exposure was not clinically relevant . Phase I and phase II clinical trials of DB05773 as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel , docetaxel , and pertuzumab have shown clinical activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . Two randomized phase III trials of DB05773 are recruiting patients : EMILIA ( NCT00829166 ) is evaluating DB05773 compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine , and MARIANNE ( NCT01120184 ) is evaluating DB05773 plus placebo versus DB05773 plus pertuzumab versus trastuzumab plus a taxane . Additional combinations of DB05773 ( for example , with P16260 -0941 ) and additional disease settings ( early-stage P04626 -positive breast cancer ) are also under investigation . Data from the phase III trials and other studies of DB05773 -containing agents are eagerly awaited . Cross-talk between PKA-Cβ and p65 mediates synergistic induction of Q07343 by roflumilast and NTHi . Phosphodiesterase 4B ( Q07343 ) plays a key role in regulating inflammation . DB01656 , a phosphodiesterase (PDE)4-selective inhibitor , has recently been approved for treating severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) patients with exacerbation . However , there is also clinical evidence suggesting the development of tachyphylaxis or tolerance on repeated dosing of roflumilast and the possible contribution of Q07343 up-regulation , which could be counterproductive for suppressing inflammation . Thus , understanding how Q07343 is up-regulated in the context of the complex pathogenesis and medications of P48444 may help improve the efficacy and possibly ameliorate the tolerance of roflumilast . Here we show that roflumilast synergizes with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) , a major bacterial cause of P48444 exacerbation , to up-regulate PDE4B2 expression in human airway epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo . Up-regulated PDE4B2 contributes to the induction of certain important chemokines in both enzymatic activity-dependent and activity-independent manners . We also found that protein kinase A catalytic subunit β ( PKA-Cβ ) and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) p65 subunit were required for the synergistic induction of PDE4B2 . PKA-Cβ phosphorylates p65 in a DB02527 -dependent manner . Moreover , Ser276 of p65 is critical for mediating the PKA-Cβ-induced p65 phosphorylation and the synergistic induction of PDE4B2 . Collectively , our data unveil a previously unidentified mechanism underlying synergistic up-regulation of PDE4B2 via a cross-talk between PKA-Cβ and p65 and may help develop new therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of DB05876 inhibitor .
Metallothionein prevention of arsenic trioxide-induced cardiac cell death is associated with its inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases activation in vitro and in vivo . Cardiotoxicity induced by arsenic trioxide has become a serious blockade of clinical applications of this effective anticancer agent . The general mechanism responsible for arsenic cardiotoxicity has been attributed to its induction of oxidative stress . Metallothionein ( MT ) has been extensively proven to be a potent endogenous antioxidant that protects heart against oxidative stress-induced cardiac damage . To investigate whether and how MT protects against arsenic cardiotoxicity , MT-overexpressing H9c2 ( MT-H9c2 ) cardiac cells and transgenic ( MT-TG ) mice with their corresponding controls were exposed to the clinical relevant dose of arsenic trioxide . Cardiac cell apoptosis was detected by molecular indices , including the cleavage of caspase 3 and caspase 12 , Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio , P35638 expression and/or confirmed by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay . DB01169 dose- and time-dependently induced cardiac cell death in H9c2 cells with a significant activation of major MAPK subfamily members such as P27361 /2 , JNK and p38 , but not in MT-H9c2 cells . Importantly , the protective effect of MT on arsenic trioxide-induced apoptotic cell death was completely recaptured in the heart of MT-TG with a significant prevention of MAPKs activation . These results indicate that arsenic trioxide-upregulated MAPKs might play important role in arsenic trioxide-induced apoptotic cell death in cardiac cells both in vivo and in vitro , and MT 's suppression of arsenic trioxide apoptotic effect was associated with the inhibition of MAPK activation . Therefore , selective elevation of cardiac MT levels with pharmacological approaches may be a potential strategy for the prevention of arsenic cardiotoxicity . Dissection of the phenotypic and genotypic associations with nicotinic dependence . INTRODUCTION : Strong evidence demonstrates that nicotine dependence is associated with 4 genetic variants rs16969968 , rs6474412 , rs3733829 , and rs1329650 in large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies . We examined how these identified genetic variants relate to nicotine dependence defined by different categorical and dimensional measures . METHODS : Four genetic variants were analyzed in 2,047 subjects of European descent ( 1,062 cases and 985 controls ) . DB00184 dependence was assessed with multiple smoking measures , including the Fagerström Test for DB00184 Dependence , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV ( DSM-IV ) nicotine dependence , the DB00184 Dependence Syndrome Scale , and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives . Single-item measures of cigarettes per day ( O75976 ) and time to first cigarette ( Q15669 ) in the morning were also examined . RESULTS : Among the variants , association effect sizes were largest for rs16969968 , with measures of craving and heavy smoking , especially cigarettes smoked per day , showing the largest effects . Significant but weaker associations were found for rs6474412 and rs3733729 but not for rs1329650 . None of the more comprehensive measures of smoking behaviors yielded stronger genetic associations with these variants than did O75976 . CONCLUSIONS : O75976 is an important simple measure that captures in part the genetic associations of P30532 and nicotine dependence , even when other more comprehensive measures of smoking behaviors are examined . The P30532 gene is associated with heavy compulsive smoking and craving ; this should inform the mission to improve the diagnostic validity of DSM-V . Combination gene therapy targeting on interleukin-1β and O14788 for wear debris-induced aseptic loosening . This study investigated the efficacy of a combination gene therapy to repress interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and receptor activator of nuclear factor NF-kappa B ligand ( O14788 ) for the treatment of particulate debris-induced aseptic loosening , and tried to explore the molecular mechanism of the exogenous gene modifications on osteoclastogenesis . RAW cells activated by titanium particles were transduced with DFG-IL-1Ra ( retroviral vector encoding IL-1 receptor antagonist ) and AAV- O00300 ( adeno-associated viral vectors-osteoprotegerin ) individually or in combination for 4 weeks . Pro-inflammatory cytokines in culture media were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , and gene expressions of Q9Y6Q6 , IL-1β , c-Fos , Q9Y4K3 , P45983 and CPK were examined using real-time PCR . An established knee-implant-failure mouse model was employed to evaluate the efficacy of the in vivo double-gene therapy . The surgical implantation of a titanium alloy pin into the proximal tibia was followed by monthly challenge with titanium debris . Peri-implant gene transfers of IL-1Ra and O00300 ( respectively or in combination ) were given 3 weeks after surgery . The combination of O00300 and IL-1Ra gene transfer exhibited strong synergetic effects in blockage of inflammation and osteoclastogenesis at 8 weeks after gene modification . The combination therapy reversed peri-implant bone resorption and restored implant stability when compared with either single gene transduction . Real-time PCR data indicated that the action of IL-1Ra gene therapy may be mediated via the P45983 pathway , while the reduction of osteoclastogenesis by O00300 gene modification may be regulated by c-Fos expression . In addition , both gene modifications resulted in significant diminishment of Q9Y4K3 expression . TG-interacting factor transcriptionally induced by AKT/ O43524 is a negative regulator that antagonizes arsenic trioxide-induced cancer cell apoptosis . DB01169 ( ATO ) is a multi-target drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration as the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia . In addition , several clinical trials are being conducted with arsenic-based drugs for the treatment of other hematological malignancies and solid tumors . However , ATO 's modest clinical efficacy on some cancers , and potential toxic effects on humans have been reported . Determining how best to reduce these adverse effects while increasing its therapeutic efficacy is obviously a critical issue . Previously , we demonstrated that the JNK-induced complex formation of phosphorylated c-Jun and TG-interacting factor ( Q15583 ) antagonizes P29323 -induced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P38936 ( P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) ) expression and resultant apoptosis in response to ATO in A431 cells . Surprisingly , at low-concentrations ( 0.1-0.2 μM ) , ATO increased cellular proliferation , migration and invasion , involving Q15583 expression , however , at high-concentrations ( 5-20 μM ) , ATO induced cell apoptosis . Using a promoter analysis , Q15583 was transcriptionally regulated by ATO at the O43524 binding site ( -1486 to -1479bp ) via the c-Src/ P00533 /AKT pathway . Stable overexpression of Q15583 promoted advancing the cell cycle into the S phase , and attenuated 20 μM ATO-induced apoptosis . Furthermore , blockage of the AKT pathway enhanced ATO-induced P38936 expression and resultant apoptosis in cancer cells , but overexpression of P31749 inhibited P38936 expression . Therefore , we suggest that Q15583 is transcriptionally regulated by the c-Src/ P00533 /AKT pathway , which plays a role as a negative regulator in antagonizing ATO-induced P38936 expression and resultant apoptosis . Suppression of these antagonistic effects might be a promising therapeutic strategy toward improving clinical efficacy of ATO . DB01169 inhibits osteosarcoma cell invasiveness via MAPK signaling pathway . DB01169 ( As(2)O(3) ) is an active ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine . Recent studies showed that it causes apoptosis in several cancer cells . However , research of As(2)O(3) in osteosarcoma is sparse . In our present study , an inhibitory effect of As(2)O(3) on osteosarcoma cell adhesion and metastasis was observed with a cell adhesion , migration and invasion test . The impact of As(2)O(3) on the activities of P14780 and MAPK pathway-related downstream factors was analyzed by western blotting . Our results showed that As(2)O(3) significantly inhibited motility , migration and invasion in Q9UKB1 and MNNG cells in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 0.5-2 μM , and led to cytoskeletal rearrangements . As(2)O(3) exerted an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of P27361 /2 and MEK , which are the members of the MAPK family . Additionally , treatment with As(2)O(3) in combination with inhibitors specific for MEK ( U0126 ) in Q9UKB1 and MNNG cells resulted in a marked inhibition of cell invasion and As(2)O(3) could significantly reduce PMA-induced invasion . In conclusion , we demonstrate the inhibitory effects of As(2)O(3) on the invasiveness of Q9UKB1 and MNNG cells , which may be due at least partly to inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway . P02649 : a potent inhibitor of endothelial and tumor cell proliferation . Recombinant human apolipoprotein E3 ( apoE ) , purified from E. coli , inhibited the proliferation of several cell types , including endothelial cells and tumor cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner . ApoE inhibited both de novo DNA synthesis and proliferation as assessed by an increase in cell number . Maximal inhibition of cell growth by apoE was achieved under conditions where proliferation was dependent on heparin-binding growth factors . Thus , at low serum concentrations ( 0-2.5 % ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) stimulated the proliferation of bovine aortic endothelial ( BAE ) cells severalfold . The P09038 -dependent proliferation was dramatically inhibited by apoE with an IC50 approximately 50 nM . Under conditions where cell proliferation was mainly serum-dependent , apoE also suppressed growth but required higher concentrations to be effective ( IC50 approximately 500 nM ) . ApoE also inhibited growth of bovine corneal endothelial cells , human melanoma cells , and human breast carcinoma cells . The IC50 values obtained with these cells were generally 3-5 times higher than with BAE cells . Inhibition of cell proliferation by apoE was reversible and dependent on the time of apoE addition to the culture . In addition , apoE inhibited the chemotactic response of endothelial cells that were induced to migrate by a gradient of soluble P09038 . Inhibition of cell proliferation by apoE may be mediated both by competition for growth factor binding to proteoglycans and by an antiadhesive activity of apoE . The present results demonstrate that apoE is a potent inhibitor of proliferation of several cell types and suggest that apoE may be effective in modulating angiogenesis , tumor cell growth , and metastasis . DB01169 ( ATO ) and Q02750 inhibition synergize to induce apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells . Recent studies suggest that components of the prosurvival signal transduction pathways involving the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) can confer an aggressive , apoptosis-resistant phenotype to leukemia cells . In this study , we report that acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) cells exploit the Ras-MAPK activation pathway to phosphorylate at Ser112 and to inactivate the proapoptotic protein Bad , delaying arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) -induced apoptosis . Both in APL cell line NB4 and in APL primary blasts , the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) and Bad phosphorylation by Q02750 inhibitors enhanced apoptosis in ATO-treated cells . We isolated an arsenic-resistant NB4 subline ( NB4-As(R) ) , which showed stronger P27361 /2 activity ( 2.7-fold increase ) and Bad phosphorylation ( 2.4-fold increase ) compared to parental NB4 cells in response to ATO treatment . Upon ATO exposure , both NB4 and NB4-As(R) cell lines doubled protein levels of the death antagonist Bcl-xL , but the amount of free Bcl-xL that did not heterodimerize with Bad was 1.8-fold greater in NB4-As(R) than in the parental line . Q02750 inhibitors dephosphorylated Bad and inhibited the ATO-induced increase of Bcl-xL , overcoming ATO resistance in NB4-As(R) . These results may provide a rationale to develop combined or sequential Q02750 inhibitors plus ATO therapy in this clinical setting . DB06643 for joints and bones . DB06643 is an investigational , fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity and specificity for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) , a cytokine member of the tumor necrosis factor family . O14788 , an essential mediator of osteoclast formation , function , and survival , plays a major role in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis , structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis , and bone loss associated with other skeletal disorders . DB06643 suppresses bone turnover by inhibiting the action of O14788 on osteoclasts . DB06643 reduces bone turnover and increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density , reduces fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis , and inhibits structural damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis when added to ongoing methotrexate treatment . It is generally well tolerated , with a good safety profile . Adverse and serious adverse events , including infections and malignancy , are similar in patients treated with denosumab or placebo . Extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the small GTP-binding protein , Rac , contribute to the effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 on gene expression . The kinases and regulatory proteins that convey signals initiated by transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) to the nucleus are poorly characterized . To study the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) pathway in this process , we transiently transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with TGF-beta-responsive luciferase reporter genes and expression vectors designed to interrupt this kinase cascade . Mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase phosphatase-1 and a dominant negative Q96HU1 / P29323 kinase 1 mutant reduced stimulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) promoter activity by TGF-beta1 from 11.5- to 4-fold and 4.9-fold , respectively . Similar results were observed with the type I collagen promoters . TGF-beta1 increased P27361 activity 4.5-fold at 5 min and 3 . 1-fold at 3 h , while Jun kinase and p38 activity were not affected . Cotransfection of a dominant negative mutant of the small G protein , Rac , but not dominant negative Ras , Cdc42 , or Rho mutants , reduced the effects of TGF-beta1 on the P05121 promoter by approximately half . In support of a role for Rac in signaling by TGF-beta , GTP binding to Rac was increased 3.7-fold following exposure of NIH 3T3 cells to TGF-beta1 for 3 min . These findings indicate that TGF-beta1 modulates gene expression partly through P29323 and Rac in NIH 3T3 cells . Activation of the p38 MAPK/Akt/ P27361 /2 signal pathways is required for the protein stabilization of Q99741 and cyclin D1 in low-dose arsenite-induced cell proliferation . DB01169 ( ATO ) is a first-line anti-cancer agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia , and induces apoptosis in other solid cancer cell lines including breast cancer cells . However , as with arsenites found in drinking water and used as raw materials for wood preservatives , insecticides , and herbicides , low doses of ATO can induce carcinogenesis after long-term exposure . At 24 h after exposure , ATO ( 0.01-1 µM ) significantly increased cell proliferation and promoted cell cycle progression from the P55008 to S/G2 phases in the non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cell line . The expression of 14 out of 96 cell-cycle-associated genes significantly increased , and seven of these genes including cell division cycle 6 ( Q99741 ) and cyclin D1 ( P24385 ) were closely related to cell cycle progression from P55008 to S phase . Low-dose ATO steadily increased gene transcript and protein levels of both Q99741 and cyclin D1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Low-dose ATO produced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , and activated the p38 MAPK , Akt , and P27361 /2 pathways at different time points within 60 min . Small molecular inhibitors and siRNAs inhibiting the activation of p38 MAPK , Akt , and P27361 /2 decreased the ATO-increased expression of Q99741 protein . Inhibiting the activation of Akt and P27361 /2 , but not p38 MAPK , decreased the ATO-induced expression of cyclin D1 protein . This study reports for the first time that p38 MAPK/Akt/ P27361 /2 activation is required for the protein stabilization of Q99741 in addition to cyclin D1 in ATO-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle modulation from P55008 to S phase . Inhibition of P29323 activation enhances the repair of double-stranded breaks via non-homologous end joining by increasing P78527 activation . Non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) is one of the major pathways that repairs double-stranded DNA breaks ( DSBs ) . Activation of DNA-PK is required for NHEJ . However , the mechanism leading to P78527 activation remains incompletely understood . We provide evidence here that the MEK- P29323 pathway plays a role in P78527 -mediated NHEJ . In comparison to the vehicle control ( DB01093 ) , etoposide ( ETOP ) -induced DSBs in MCF7 cells were more rapidly repaired in the presence of U0126 , a specific MEK inhibitor , based on the reduction of γ P16104 and tail moments . Additionally , U0126 increased reactivation of luciferase activity , which resulted from the repair of restriction enzyme-cleaved DSBs . Furthermore , while inhibition of P29323 activation using the dominant-negative MEK1K97M accelerated the repair of DSBs , enforcing P29323 activation with the constitutively active MEK1Q56P reduced DSB repair . In line with MEK activating P27361 and P28482 kinases , knockdown of either P27361 or P28482 increased DSB repair . Consistent with the activation of P78527 being required for NHEJ , we demonstrated that inhibition of P29323 activation using U0126 , MEK1K97M , and knockdown of P27361 or P28482 enhanced ETOP-induced activation of P78527 . Conversely , enforcing P29323 activation by MEK1Q56P reduced ETOP-initiated P78527 activation . Taken together , we demonstrate that P29323 reduces NHEJ-mediated repair of DSBs via attenuation of P78527 activation . Kirenol stimulates osteoblast differentiation through activation of the BMP and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in MC3T3-E1 cells . Kirenol has been reported to possess anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory , anti-allergic , anti-adipogenic , and anti-arthritic activities ; however , its effect on osteoblast differentiation has not yet been reported . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of kirenol on osteoblast differentiation through activation of the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in MC3T3-E1 cells . Kirenol markedly promoted alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity and mineralization . Kirenol not only increased the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers , such as ALP , type I collagen ( ColA1 ) , and osteopontin ( P10451 ) , but also increased the expression of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand ( O00300 / O14788 ) ratio . The effects of kirenol on osteoblast differentiation were accompanied by stimulating the expression of the BMP and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways , including P12643 , runt-related transcription factor 2 ( Runx2 ) , osterix ( Osx ) , low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 ( O75197 ) , disheveled 2 ( O14641 ) , β-catenin , cyclin D1 ( P24385 ) , and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSK3β ) . In addition , kirenol up-regulated the expression of β-catenin , P24385 , ALP , and ColA1 which were down-regulated by siRNA knockdown of β-catenin . Overall , these results demonstrate that kirenol is capable of promoting osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells through activation of the BMP and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways , suggesting that it is a potential candidate target for treating or preventing osteoporosis . P14921 , NFkappaB and P05412 synergistically transactivate the human GM- P04141 promoter . Activation of helper T cells results in coordinate expression of a number of cytokines involved in differentiation , proliferation and activation of the haematopoietic system . Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) is one such cytokine , whose increased expression results mostly from increases in transcription . Cis-acting elements with NFkappaB , P05412 and ETS-like binding motifs have been identified in the promoter region of the GM- P04141 gene , and are important or essential for transcriptional activity following T cell activation . P14921 is a transcription factor of the ETS family that is expressed in T cells . We have previously shown that P14921 can transactivate GM- P04141 in Jurkat T cells , but only after the cells have been stimulated by treatment with PMA and ionomycin , agents that mimic T cell activation . Thus we proposed that P14921 , which is expressed constitutively in Jurkat cells , may act in concert with PMA/ionomycin inducible factors . Here we show that P14921 can transactivate a GM- P04141 reporter construct in unstimulated Jurkat cells , providing that either NFkappaB or P05412 transcription factors are supplied by co-transfection . We confirm that binding of endogenous NFkappaB and P05412 is induced following PMA/ionomycin treatment of T cells . Transactivation by P14921 , NFkappaB and P05412 is synergistic , and mutation of the individual binding sites reveals that the transcriptional activities of these factors are interdependent . Our results suggest that constitutive P14921 , and inducible NFkappaB and P05412 , cooperate as part of a higher order transcriptional complex in activated T cells . O75915 is required for arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells via reactive oxygen species and mitochondria linked signal pathway . DB01169 , emerging as a standard therapy for refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia , induces apoptosis in a variety of malignant cell lines . O75915 , a novel retinoic acid-inducible gene , is known to be involved in apoptosis induced by various agents , for example , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate , N-4-hydroxy-phenyl-retinamide and arsenic trioxide . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying how O75915 gene is functionally involved in apoptosis remain largely unknown . Herein , our studies demonstrated that treatment of arsenic trioxide produced apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner and paralleled with increased O75915 expression . O75915 expression was dependent upon generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by arsenic trioxide . Knockdown of O75915 attenuated arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis , and was accompanied by significantly reduced activity of caspase-9 , enhanced Bad phosphorylation and inhibited Q02750 /2 , P27361 /2 and JNK phosphorylations . DB01169 induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was O75915 -dependent . These findings suggest that O75915 may serve as a pro-apoptotic molecule to mediate arsenic trioxide triggered apoptosis via a reactive oxygen species and mitochondria-associated signal pathway . DB01169 concentration determines the fate of Ewing 's sarcoma family tumors and neuroblastoma cells in vitro . DB01169 ( As(2)O(3) ) induces both the differentiation and apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells in a concentration dependent manner . We assessed the effects of As(2)O(3) in CADO-ES Ewing 's sarcoma ( ES ) , JK-GMS peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) , and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells , as they share common histogenetic backgrounds . As(2)O(3) at low concentrations ( 0.1-1 microM ) induced SH-SY5Y differentiation , and whereas PNET cells acquired a slightly differentiated phenotype , change was minimal in ES cells . P28482 ( P28482 ) was activated at low As(2)O(3) concentrations , and PD98059 , an inhibitor of MEK-1 , blocked SH-SY5Y cell differentiation by As(2)O(3) . High concentrations ( 2-10 microM ) of As(2)O(3) induced the apoptosis in all three cell lines , and this was accompanied by the activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase . The generation of H(2)O(2) and activation of caspase 3 were identified as critical components of As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis in all of the above cell lines . P09038 enhanced As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis in JK-GMS cells . The overall effects of As(2)O(3) strongly suggest that it has therapeutic potential for the treatment of ES/PNET . DB01037 transdermal system : in the treatment of major depressive disorder . The monamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitor selegiline is selective for P27338 at the low oral dosages used in the treatment of Parkinson 's disease . However , P21397 is also inhibited at the high oral dosages needed to effectively treat depression ( not an approved indication ) , necessitating a tyramine-restricted diet . The selegiline transdermal system was designed to deliver antidepressant drug concentrations to the CNS , without substantially impairing small intestine P21397 activity . At the target dose of 6 mg/24 hours , tyramine dietary restrictions are not needed . Short-term treatment with fixed ( 6 mg/24 hours ) or flexible ( 6 , 9 or 12 mg/24 hours ) doses of selegiline transdermal system was superior to placebo on most measures of antidepressant activity in 6- or 8-week , randomised , double-blind , multicentre studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Likewise , long-term treatment with a fixed dose of selegiline transdermal system 6 mg/24 hours was superior to placebo as maintenance therapy in a 52-week , randomised , double-blind , multicentre , relapse-prevention trial in patients with MDD . DB01037 transdermal system therapy was generally well tolerated in placebo-controlled studies ; application site reactions , mostly of mild to moderate severity , were the most commonly reported adverse events . The incidence of sexual adverse effects and weight gain was low and similar to that with placebo . DB00293 ( DB00293 ) : from concept to care , a programme in rational drug discovery . DB00158 -based anticancer drugs with specificity for thymidylate synthase ( TS ) have come of age . Ideas nurtured in the early 1970s led to the first-generation of antifolates with TS and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitory activities . Compounds with increased selectivity for TS followed with the highly specific inhibitor , CB3717 being synthesised in 1979 at the Institute of Cancer Research ( ICR ) . CB3717 had significant clinical activity but its development had to be abandoned because its low aqueous solubility led to occasional nephrotoxicity . Collaborative laboratory studies between the ICR and ICI Pharmaceuticals ( later to become Zeneca Pharmaceuticals ) led to the discovery of DB00293 ( DB00293 ) , the first antifolate to be licensed for the treatment of cancer ( UK 1995 ) in nearly 40 years and the first new drug for colorectal cancer in about 35 years . DB00293 belongs to a class of compounds that use the reduced-folate carrier ( P41440 ) for uptake into cells and which are excellent substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( Q05932 ) . This paper reviews the underlying philosophies , and the milestones reached during the development of DB00293 . DB01169 phosphorylates c-Fos to transactivate P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) expression . An infamous poison , arsenic also has been used as a drug for nearly 2400 years ; in recently years , arsenic has been effective in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia . Increasing evidence suggests that opposite effects of arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) on tumors depend on its concentrations . For this reason , the mechanisms of action of the drug should be elucidated , and it should be used therapeutically only with extreme caution . Previously , we demonstrated the opposing effects of P27361 /2 and JNK on P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) ( P38936 ) expression in response to ATO in A431 cells . In addition , JNK phosphorylates c-Jun ( DB00133 (63/73) ) to recruit Q15583 / Q13547 to suppress P38936 gene expression . Presently , we demonstrated that a high concentration of ATO sustains P27361 /2 phosphorylation , and increases c-Fos biosynthesis and stability , which enhances P38936 gene expression . Using site-directed mutagenesis , a DNA affinity precipitation assay , and functional assays , we demonstrated that phosphorylation of the C-terminus of c-Fos ( DB00156 (232) , DB00156 (325) , DB00156 (331) , and DB00133 (374) ) plays an important role in its binding to the P38936 promoter , and in conjunction with N-terminus phosphorylation of c-Fos ( DB00133 (70) ) to transactivate P38936 promoter expression . In conclusion , a high concentration of ATO can sustain P27361 /2 activation to enhance c-Fos expression , then dimerize with dephosphorylated c-Jun ( DB00133 (63/73) ) and recruit p300/CBP to the Sp1 sites ( -84/-64 ) to activate P38936 gene expression in A431 cells . P10275 is expressed in murine choroid plexus and downregulated by 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone in male and female mice . The choroid plexuses ( CPs ) of the brain form a unique interface between the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) . CPs produce several neuroprotective peptides , which are secreted into the P04141 . Despite their importance in neuroprotection , the mechanisms underlying the regulation of most of these peptides in CPs remain unknown . Androgens regulate the expression of neuroprotective peptides in several tissues where the androgen receptor ( AR ) is coexpressed , including the brain . The presence of AR in CPs has never been investigated , but recent studies in our laboratory show that the CP is an androgen-responsive tissue . In order to fulfill this gap , we investigated and characterized AR distribution and expression in male and female rat CPs and in primary cultures from rat CP epithelial cells . In addition , the response of AR to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) in castrated male and female mice subjected to DB02901 replacement was analyzed . We show that rat CP epithelial cells contain AR mRNA and protein . Moreover , we demonstrate that AR is downregulated by DB02901 in mice CPs . Copy number analysis of 24 oncogenes : O15151 identified as a putative marker for low recurrence risk in non muscle invasive bladder cancer . Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) generally have a high risk of relapsing locally after primary tumor resection . The search for new predictive markers of local recurrence thus represents an important goal for the management of this disease . We studied the copy number variations ( CNVs ) of 24 oncogenes ( O15151 , P04198 , Q9UM73 , P16234 , P10721 , P35968 , P00374 , P00533 , MET , SMO , P11362 , MYC , P00519 , P07949 , P24385 , P30279 , P11802 , Q00987 , Q96GD4 , P04626 , P11388 , O14965 , AR and P15056 ) using multiplex ligation probe amplification technique to verify their role as predictive markers of recurrence . DB03843 -fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 43 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder ( TURB ) were used ; 23 patients had relapsed and 20 were disease-free after 5 years . Amplification frequencies were analyzed for all genes and O15151 was the only gene that showed significantly higher amplification in non recurrent patients than in recurrent ones ( 0.65 vs. 0.3 ; Fisher 's test p=0.023 ) . Recurrence-free survival analysis confirmed the predictive role of O15151 ( log-rank test p=0.041 ) . Our preliminary results indicate a putative role for the O15151 gene in predicting local recurrence of bladder cancer . Confirmation of this hypothesis is needed in a larger cohort of NMIBC patients . Multiple pathways of apolipoprotein E signaling in primary neurons . P02649 is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer 's disease , and the apoE protein is associated with beta-amyloid deposits in Alzheimer 's disease brain . We examined signaling pathways stimulated by apoE in primary neurons in culture . ApoE and an apoE-derived peptide activated several intracellular kinases , including prominently extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) . P27361 /2 activation by apoE was blocked by an inhibitor of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family , the specific DB01221 glutamate receptor antagonist MK 801 and other calcium channel blockers . Activation of apoE receptors also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 , an adaptor protein of apoE receptors , but experiments in Dab1 knockout neurons demonstrated that Dab1 was not necessary for P29323 activation . In contrast , apoE treatment of primary neurons decreased activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase , a kinase that interacts with another apoE receptor adaptor protein , c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein . This change also depended on interactions with the low-density lipoprotein receptor family but was independent of calcium channels . c-Jun N-terminal kinase deactivation by apoE was blocked by gamma-secretase inhibitors and pertussis toxin . These results demonstrate that apoE affects several signaling cascades in neurons : increased disabled phosphorylation , activation of the P27361 /2 pathway ( dependent on calcium influx via the DB01221 receptor ) and inhibition of the P45983 /2 pathway ( dependent on gamma-secretase and G proteins ) . Convergent and divergent cellular responses by ErbB4 isoforms in mammary epithelial cells . Associations of ErbB4 ( Q15303 / Q15303 ) , the fourth member of the P00533 family , with cancer are variable , possibly as a result of structural diversity of this receptor . There are multiple structural isoforms of Q15303 arising by alternative mRNA splicing , and a subset undergo proteolysis that releases membrane-anchored and soluble isoforms that associate with transcription factors and coregulators to modulate transcription . To compare the differential and common signaling activities of full-length ( FL ) and soluble intracellular isoforms of Q15303 , four JM-a isoforms ( FL and soluble intracellular domain ( ICD ) CYT-1 and CYT-2 ) were expressed in isogenic MCF10A cells and their biologic activities were analyzed . Both FL and ICD CYT-2 promoted cell proliferation and invasion , and CYT-1 suppressed cell growth . Transcriptional profiling revealed several new and underexplored Q15303 -regulated transcripts , including : proteases/protease inhibitors ( P08254 and P07093 ) , the YAP/Hippo pathway ( P29279 , O00622 , and P09486 ) , the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway ( P04035 , Q01581 , P01130 , and Q9UBM7 ) , and cytokines ( P10145 , P78556 , and P09341 ) . Many of these transcripts were subsequently validated in a luminal breast cancer cell line that normally expresses Q15303 . Furthermore , ChIP-seq experiments identified O75689 , P02649 , P09486 , P16949 , and Q05195 as novel molecular targets of Q15303 . These findings clarify the diverse biologic activities of Q15303 isoforms , and reveal new and divergent functions . IMPLICATIONS : ErbB4 as a regulator of Hippo and mevalonate pathways provides new insight into milk production and anabolic processes in normal mammary epithelia and cancer . Clot penetration and retention by plasminogen activators promote fibrinolysis . P00750 ( tPA ) remains the sole thrombolytic approved by the FDA for the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE). tPA has not been replaced by third generation plasminogen activators , e.g. DB00015 ( Ret ) and DB00031 ( TNK ) that circulate with longer life-spans and in theory should have more extended potency in vivo . One reason for this paradox is the inability to assign units of activity to plasminogen activators based on specific biologically relevant standards , which impairs objective comparison . Here , we compare clot permeation , retention and fibrinolytic activities of tPA , TNK and Ret in vitro and clot composition over time with outcome in a mouse model of disseminated pulmonary microembolism ( ME ) . When clots were incubated in the continuous presence of drug , tPA , TNK and Ret lysed fibrin clots identically in the absence of PA inhibitor-1 ( e.g. P05121 ) . Ret , which has lower fibrin affinity and greater susceptibility to inhibition by P05121 than tPA , was less effective in lysing plasma clots , while TNK was less effective when the fibrin content of the clots was enhanced . However , when clots were afforded only brief exposure to drug , as occurs in vivo , Ret showed more extensive clot permeation , greater retention and lysis than tPA or TNK . These results were reproduced in vivo in a mouse model of ME . These studies indicate the need for more relevant tests of plasminogen activator activity in vitro and in vivo and they show that clot permeation and retention are important potential predictors of clinical utility . Connexin 43 and P29323 regulate tension-induced signal transduction in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts . Periodontal ligament ( PDL ) fibroblasts play an important role in preserving periodontal homeostasis and transmitting mechanical signals to alveolar bone . Connexin 43 ( P17302 ) , a gap junction protein , is essential for bone homeostasis and regulates bone remodeling . However , the function of P17302 in human PDL fibroblast-regulated bone remodeling has not yet been elucidated . In this study , human PDL fibroblasts were exposed to cyclic mechanical tension with a maximum 5 % elongation for different durations . We then examined the expression of signaling molecules related to osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis at both the mRNA and protein levels as well as the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) in human PDL fibroblasts after loading . We found that mechanical tension increased P17302 , which further upregulated osteogenic ( e.g. , Q13950 , Osterix , and O00300 ) and down-regulated osteoclastogenic ( e.g. , O14788 ) signaling molecules . Suppressing P17302 gene ( Gja1 ) by siRNA inhibited the increase in osteogenesis-related molecules but enhanced O14788 expression . Similar to P17302 , activated P27361 /2 was also enhanced by mechanical tension and suppressed by P17302 siRNA . Inhibition of P27361 /2 signaling using PD98059 reduced the tension-regulated increase in osteogenesis-related molecules but enhanced that of osteoclastogenesis-related ones . These findings suggest that cyclic tension may involve into the osteogenic or osteoclastogenetic differentiation potential of human PDL fibroblasts via the P17302 - P27361 /2 signaling pathway . Regulatory roles of sex hormones in cutaneous biology and immunology . Recent studies have revealed that sex hormones manifest a variety of biological and immunological effects in the skin . Pregnancy , menstruation and the menopause modulate the natural course of psoriasis , indicating a female hormone-induced regulation of skin inflammation . Estrogen in vitro down-regulates the production of the neutrophil , type 1 T cell and macrophage-attracting chemokines , P10145 , P02778 , P13501 , by keratinocytes , and suppresses IL-12 production and antigen-presenting capacity while enhancing anti-inflammatory P22301 production by dendritic cells . These data indicate that estrogen may attenuate inflammation in psoriatic lesions . Estrogen , alone or together with progesterone , prevents or reverses skin atrophy , dryness and wrinkles associated with chronological or photo-aging . Estrogen and progesterone stimulate proliferation of keratinocytes while estrogen suppresses apoptosis and thus prevents epidermal atrophy . Estrogen also enhances collagen synthesis , and estrogen and progesterone suppress collagenolysis by reducing matrix metalloproteinase activity in fibroblasts , thereby maintaining skin thickness . Estrogen maintains skin moisture by increasing acid mucopolysaccharide or hyaluronic acid levels in the dermis . Progesterone increases sebum secretion . Estrogen accelerates cutaneous wound healing stimulating P01138 production in macrophages , GM- P04141 production in keratinocytes and P09038 and TGF-beta1 production in fibroblasts , leading to the enhancement of wound re-innervation , re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation . In contrast , androgens prolong inflammation , reduce deposition of extracellular matrix in wounds , and reduce the rate of wound healing . Estrogen enhances P15692 production in macrophages , an effect that is antagonized by androgens and which may be related to the development of granuloma pyogenicum during pregnancy . These regulatory effects of sex steroids may be manipulated as therapeutic or prophylactic measures in psoriasis , aging , chronic wounds or granuloma pyogenicum . In search of the ideal immunopanel to distinguish metastatic mammary carcinoma from primary lung carcinoma : a tissue microarray study of 207 cases . BACKGROUND : Distinguishing metastatic carcinoma of breast origin ( MCBO ) to lung from primary lung carcinomas ( P98160 ) is a diagnostic quandary with clinical ramifications . Immunostains CK7 , CK20 , ER , PR , and Mammaglobin as well as pertinent negative stains are utilized but prove insufficient . We set out to identify stains either alone or as a group that would better discern between these 2 entities . DESIGN : Tissue microarrays of 109 MCBO to lung and 102 P98160 were stained with CK7 , CK20 , ER , PR , AR , Mammaglobin , Napsin A , GATA-3 , and Q15669 -1 . An H-score was calculated for each case and stain . RESULTS : The highest area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for each stain was seen with GATA-3 ( 0.817 ) , Napsin A ( 0.817 ) , and Q15669 -1 ( 0.854 ) . When all possible combinations were analyzed , GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 proved to correctly classify with the highest accuracy ( 0.934 ) . Combinations of GATA-3 and Napsin A ( 0.920 ) and GATA-3 , Napsin A , and Q15669 -1 ( 0.933 ) were not significantly different from GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 . The odds ratios for each stain and combination of stains showed that those for GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 were divergent , signifying that cases with higher H-scores for GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 were more likely to be classified as MCBO and P98160 , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 can correctly classify a case as either MCBO or P98160 in 93.4 % of cases . Although highly specific and sensitive for P98160 , Napsin A in lieu of Q15669 -1 or as an additional stain did not improve classification accuracy . Genotype frequencies of 50 polymorphisms for 241 Japanese non-cancer patients . This paper lists the genotype frequencies of 50 polymorphisms of 37 genes ( P05091 , P07550 , P13945 , P21964 , P16671 , P25025 , P24385 , P35354 , P11509 , P05093 , P11511 , IGF1 , IL-1A , IL-1B , IL-1RN , IL-1R1 , P05231 , P10145 , P22301 , P41159 , Le , L-myc , P05164 , Q99707 , P42898 , P21397 , P15559 , O15527 , p53 , p73 , Se , P31213 , TGF-B , P01375 -A , P01375 -B , P18074 , and P18887 ) and 6 sets of combined genotype frequencies for 241 non-cancer Japanese outpatients . Though the genotype frequencies of 25 polymorphisms have already been reported in our previous papers , 15 polymorphisms ( P16671 A52C , P25025 C785T , P24385 G870A , IGF1 C/T at intron 2 and G2502T , IL-1A 46-bp VNTR , IL-1R1 C-116T , P05231 Ins/Del 17C , P10145 A-278T and C74T , IL- 10 T-819C , P41159 A-2548G , P31213 2-bp VNTR , P18074 Lys751Gln , and P18887 Arg399Gln ) and six sets of combined genotype frequencies ( IL-1B C-31T and IL-1A C-889T , IL-1B C-31T and IL-1RN 86-bp VNTR , IL-1B C-31T and IL-1R1 C-116T , P01375 -A G-308A and P01375 -B A252G , P31213 Val89Leu and 2-bp VNTR , and P18887 Arg399Gln and P18074 Lys751Gln ) were reported in this paper for the first time for Japanese . Although microarray technology will produce this kind of information in near future , this is the first document that reports the genotype/allele frequencies among Japanese for an archival purpose . Somatostatin preserved blood brain barrier against cytokine induced alterations : possible role in multiple sclerosis . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is an inflammatory neurological disorder associated with demyelination , impaired blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , axonal damage and neuronal loss . In the present study , we measured somatostatin ( P61278 ) and tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) like immunoreactivity in P04141 samples from MS and non-MS patients . We also examined the role of P61278 in cytokines and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced damage to the BBB using human brain endothelial cells in culture . Most of the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) samples studied from definite MS patients exhibited lower somatostatin ( P61278 ) -like immunoreactivity and higher expression of P01375 -α in comparison to non-MS patients . Treatment of cells with cytokines and LPS blocked P61278 secretion and decreased P61278 expression . Human brain endothelial cells expressed all five somatostatin receptors ( SSTRs ) with increased expression of P30874 and 4 upon treatment with cytokines and LPS . Cytokines and LPS-induced disruption of the tight junction proteins Zonula occludens ( ZO-1 ) organization was restored in presence of P61278 , P30874 or P31391 selective agonists . Furthermore , inflammation induced changes in extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( P27361 /2 and Q13164 ) signaling and altered expression of endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase are modulated in presence of P61278 . These data indicate that decreased levels of P61278 contribute to failure of the BBB in MS . DB00104 and the novel multireceptor ligand somatostatin receptor agonist pasireotide ( DB06663 ) block the adrenalectomy-induced increase in mitotic activity in male rat anterior pituitary . The novel somatostatin receptor agonist pasireotide binds with high affinity to somatostatin receptors P30872 , 2 , 3 , and 5 . Acting principally through the latter , it inhibits basal and P06850 -stimulated DB01285 secretion from the AtT20 corticotroph cell line and DB01285 release from a proportion of human corticotroph adenomas both in vitro and in vivo . Data supporting an additional antiproliferative effect has led to pasireotide being explored as a potential therapy for patients with Cushing 's disease . We have compared the effects of pasireotide and octreotide on adrenalectomy-induced mitotic and apoptotic activity in the male rat anterior pituitary . Adrenalectomized rats were treated with daily sc injections of vehicle , pasireotide , or octreotide . Changes in proliferation and apoptosis were determined 2-6 d postoperatively . DB06663 and octreotide had no effect on baseline pituitary cell turnover and no measurable effects on apoptosis . However , the wave of increased mitotic activity normally seen in the pituitary after adrenalectomy was completely abolished . Nevertheless , pasireotide and octreotide did not diminish the increase in DB01285 -immunopositive cell index after adrenalectomy , indicating that cell division and differentiation of hormonally null cells in the pituitary are under independent control . In conclusion , basal cell turnover in the pituitary is not inhibited by pasireotide or octreotide . Bilateral adrenalectomy stimulates differentiation of preexisting null cells into DB01285 -positive cells . Cell division after bilateral adrenalectomy occurs in a specific subpopulation of hormonally null cells that are equally sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of pasireotide and octreotide , implicating P30874 receptors in this antimitotic response . Q96RP3 is expressed in human pregnant myometrial cells and regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation : potential role of the type-2 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor in the control of myometrial contractility . The family of P06850 -related peptides are suggested to play important roles in the control of myometrial contractility during pregnancy and labor . In this study we investigated the expression of urocortin II ( P55089 II ) in human myometrium and its ability to phosphorylate intracellular components that can be involved in modulating myometrial contractility . Using RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization , we demonstrated that P55089 II and type-2 P06850 receptor ( Q13324 ) mRNAs were expressed in human nonpregnant and pregnant myometrium . Immunofluorescent studies confirmed protein expression of P55089 II in human pregnant myometrial cells , whereas chemical cross-linking studies with radiolabeled P55089 II confirmed the presence of Q13324 sites with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa . Treatment of primary human myometrial cells with P55089 II to specifically activate Q13324 resulted in a dose-dependent increase of myosin light chain ( MLC(20) ) phosphorylation . Activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and P27361 /2 was required for the P55089 II-induced activation of MLC(20) , because treatment of myometrial cells with inhibitors of MAPK kinase 1 ( U0126 ) and PKC ( bisindolylmaleimide ) inhibited the P55089 II-induced phosphorylation of MLC(20) . Furthermore , the P55089 II effect on MLC(20) was dependent on RhoA translocation to the membrane and subsequent activation of RhoA-associated kinase , as shown by the use of the specific inhibitors exoenzyme P01024 and Y27632 . Collectively , our data suggest a distinctive role for Q13324 - specific agonists like P55089 II in the control of myometrial contractility during human pregnancy involving sequential activation of PKC , MAPK kinase 1 , P27361 /2 , RhoA , and RhoA-associated kinase , leading to the MLC(20) phosphorylation . DB00104 prevents growth factor-induced proliferation of bovine retinal endothelial cells under hypoxia . Ocular diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy are the major cause of blindness in industrialized countries . The main pathologic features of these diseases are hypoxia and overproduction of growth factors resulting in pathologic proliferation of endothelial cells and new vessel formation . Particularly , hypoxia and growth factors , such as P15692 , DB01277 , P09038 and TGF beta(2) , show a complex interaction in the onset and progression of the diseases . Therefore , to date , most therapeutic strategies for proliferative retinopathies have targeted proliferation of endothelial cells evoked by growth factors . Recently , a synthetic analog of somatostatin , octreotide , has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various cells in vitro , including endothelial cells . In this study , we have investigated the proliferative response of bovine retinal endothelial cells ( BREC ) to growth factors under hypoxic conditions and the modulation by octreotide . We found a dose-dependent increase of cell proliferation with P15692 , DB01277 and P09038 , and inhibition of hypoxia-induced cell proliferation with TGF beta(2) . Moreover , growth factor-induced , but not hypoxia-induced , cell proliferation was attenuated in the presence of octreotide . In contrast , TGF beta(2) abolished hypoxia-induced BREC proliferation . Similar to octreotide BIM23027 , a somatastatin receptor subtype 2 ( P30874 ) receptor agonist was able to attenuate the growth factor-induced proliferation of BREC expressing mRNA and protein for P30874 . Therefore , we postulate that octreotide exerts its effects mainly through binding to the P30874 . Taken together , our findings point to octreotide as a promising candidate for the treatment of eye disorders involving growth factor-dependent proliferation of endothelial cells . DB01169 -mediated antiplatelet activity : pivotal role of the phospholipase C gamma 2-protein kinase C-p38 MAPK cascade . DB01169 produces high rates of complete clinical remission in patients with relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia . Platelet activation is relevant in a variety of acute thrombotic events and coronary heart diseases . Few studies have examined the effects of arsenic trioxide on platelets , and the mechanisms underlying the signaling pathways remain obscure . The aim of this study was to examine systematically the detailed mechanisms of arsenic trioxide in preventing platelet activation . DB01169 ( 5 micromol/L ) exhibited more potent activity at inhibiting collagen ( 1 microg/mL ) -induced platelet aggregation than other agonists . DB01169 ( 15 and 25 micromol/L ) inhibited collagen-induced platelet activation accompanied by [Ca(+2)]i mobilization , thromboxane A(2) ( TxA(2) ) formation , phospholipase C ( P98160 )gamma 2 phosphorylation , and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation . DB01169 ( 15 and 25 micromol/L ) did not significantly affect cyclic nucleotide-induced vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation . Moreover , arsenic trioxide markedly inhibited p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) but not P45983 /2 or P28482 phosphorylation in washed platelets . DB01169 also markedly reduced hydroxyl radical ( OH(.) ) formation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( P03372 ) study . The most important findings of this study suggest that the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide possibly involves inhibition of the P98160 gamma 2-PKC-p38 MAPK cascade , thereby leading to inhibition of [Ca(+2)]i or free radical formation , and finally the inhibition of platelet aggregation . DB01169 induces apoptosis through JNK and P29323 in human mesothelioma cells . Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive tumor of serosal surfaces , which is refractory to current treatment options . DB01169 ( As2O3 ) is used clinically to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia , and also to inhibit proliferation of several solid tumors including hepatoma , esophageal , and gastric cancer in vitro . Here we found that As2O3 inhibited cell viability of a mesothelioma cell line , NCI-H2052 . As2O3 induced apoptosis of NCI-H2052 cells , which was accompanied by activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 , extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 , and caspase-3 . zVAD-fmk , a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor , inhibited As2O3-induced apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 , but not that of P45983 /2 and P27361 /2 . Small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) targeting P45983 /2 suppressed As2O3-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis , indicating that P45983 /2 regulate As2O3-induced apoptosis though caspase cascade . Furthermore , P45983 siRNA abrogated As2O3-induced P45984 phosphorylation and P45984 siRNA abrogated As2O3-induced P45983 phosphorylation , suggesting that P45983 and P45984 interact with each other . Moreover , P45983 siRNA , but not P45984 siRNA , abrogated As2O3-induced P27361 /2 phosphorylation . P45984 siRNA together with PD98059 , a specific MAPK/ P29323 kinase inhibitor , suppressed As2O3-induced apoptosis more significantly than P45984 siRNA alone . These results indicated that As2O3 induces apoptosis of NCI-H2052 cells mainly through P45983 /2 activation , and that P27361 /2 is involved in As2O3-induced apoptosis when P45983 /2 are inactivated . Interaction of the cholinergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as a risk factor for depression : evidence from a genetic association study . Chronic stress and related disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity is a known risk factor for depression . Besides its effects on glucocorticoids , stress also impacts the cholinergic system . Therefore , the interaction of two polymorphisms , one on the cholinergic P43681 receptor gene and one on the glucocorticoid receptor gene ( P04150 ) , on depression was investigated . In a sample of 800 healthy participants , we genotyped for the P24385 rs41423247 and the P43681 rs1044396 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and assessed depressiveness by means of the Beck Depression Inventory . We identified a significant epistasis effect P24385 by P43681 showing that carriers of the CC genotype at the P24385 locus who were also homozygous for the T allele at the P43681 locus had the highest depression scores . This is the first evidence from molecular genetics to show that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the cholinergic system -- both involved in stress reactivity -- represent a combined risk factor for depression . Importance of MEK in neutrophil microbicidal responsiveness . Exposure of neutrophils to inflammatory stimuli such as the chemoattractant FMLP leads to activation of responses including cell motility , the oxidative burst , and secretion of proteolytic enzymes . A signaling cascade involving sequential activation of P04049 , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK ) , and extracellular signal regulated kinase ( P29323 ) is also rapidly activated after agonist exposure . The temporal relationship between these events suggests that the kinases may be involved in triggering the effector functions , but direct evidence of a causal relationship is lacking . To assess the role of the MEK/ P29323 pathway in the activation of neutrophil responses , we studied the effects of PD098059 , a potent and selective inhibitor of MEK . Preincubation of human neutrophils with 50 microM PD098059 almost completely ( > 90 % ) inhibited the FMLP-induced activation of MEK-1 and MEK-2 , the isoforms expressed by neutrophils . This dose of PD098059 virtually abrogated chemoattractant-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of P27361 and P28482 , implying that MEKs are the predominant upstream activators of these mitogen-activated protein kinases . Pretreatment of neutrophils with the MEK antagonist inhibited the oxidative burst substantially and phagocytosis only moderately . In addition , PD098059 antagonized the delay of apoptosis induced by exposure to granulocyte-macrophage P04141 . However , the effects of PD098059 were selective , as it failed to inhibit other responses , including chemoattractant-induced exocytosis of primary and secondary granules , polymerization of F-actin , chemotaxis , or activation of phospholipase A2 . We conclude that MEK and P29323 contribute to the activation of the oxidative burst and phagocytosis , and participate in cytokine regulation of apoptosis . Menadione reduction by pharmacological doses of ascorbate induces an oxidative stress that kills breast cancer cells . Oxidative stress generated by ascorbate-driven menadione redox cycling kills MCF7 cells by a concerted mechanism including glycolysis inhibition , loss of calcium homeostasis , DNA damage and changes in mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) activities . Cell death is mediated by necrosis rather than apoptosis or macroautophagy . Neither 3-methyladenine nor Z-VAD affects cytotoxicity by ascorbate/menadione ( Asc/Men ) . BAPTA-AM , by restoring cellular capacity to reduce MTT , underlines the role of calcium in the necrotic process . Oxidative stress-mediated cell death is shown by the opposite effects of DB06151 and 3-aminotriazole . Moreover , oxidative stress induces DNA damage ( protein poly-ADP-ribosylation and gamma- P16104 phosphorylation ) and inhibits glycolysis . Asc/Men deactivates extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) while activating p38 , suggesting an additional mechanism to kill MCF7 cells . Since ascorbate is taken up by cancer cells and , due to their antioxidant enzyme deficiency , oxidative stress should affect cancer cells to a greater extent than normal cells . This differential sensitivity may have clinical applications . Multiplex protein signature for the detection of bladder cancer in voided urine samples . PURPOSE : Accurate urine assays for bladder cancer detection would benefit patients and health care systems . Through extensive genomic and proteomic profiling of urine components we previously identified a panel of 8 biomarkers that can facilitate the detection of bladder cancer in voided urine samples . In this study we confirmed this diagnostic molecular signature in a diverse multicenter cohort . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We performed a case-control , phase II study in which we analyzed voided urine from 102 subjects with bladder cancer and 206 with varying urological disorders . The urinary concentration of 8 biomarkers ( P10145 , P14780 and 10 , P05121 , P15692 , P03950 , Q16790 and P02649 ) was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Diagnostic performance of the panel of tested biomarkers was evaluated using ROCs and descriptive statistical values , eg sensitivity and specificity . RESULTS : Seven of the 8 urine biomarkers were increased in subjects with bladder cancer relative to those without bladder cancer . The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model , which had an AUROC of 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.84-0.93 ) , and 74 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity . In contrast , the sensitivity of voided urine cytology and the UroVysion® cytogenetic test in this cohort was 39 % and 54 % , respectively . Study limitations include analysis performed on banked urine samples and the lack of voided urine cytology and cytogenetic test data on controls . CONCLUSIONS : The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays . Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater . Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma , originally described in the lung . The tumor rarely occurs in extrapulmonary sites like the gastrointestinal tract , and only few examples have been described in the ampulla of Vater . A new case of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater in a 60-year-old man is reported . After pancreatoduodenectomy , macroscopic examination revealed ulcerated tumor in the region of the ampulla of Vater . Microscopically , the tumor exhibited organoid , predominantly nested growth pattern , consisting of large , polygonal cells with pleomorphic nuclei . Average number of mitoses was 36 per 10 high-power fields . Small and large areas of necrosis were identified . Immunohistochemically , the tumor cells were positive for synaptophysin , chromogranin A , P09936 , neuron-specific enolase , pancytokeratin , CK8 and somatostatin and negative for CK7 , CK20 , S-100 , Q15669 -1 , HMB-45 , CD117 , P12830 and regulatory peptides . Ki-67 proliferative index was 41 % . Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) analysis showed almost identical results for Q13547 , Q92769 and O15379 -- 60 , 60.3 and 61 % , respectively . Two months after surgery , liver metastases occurred , confirming highly aggressive behavior of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma . DB01169 induces cardiac fibroblast apoptosis in vitro and in vivo by up-regulating TGF-β1 expression . DB01169 ( As2O3 ; ATO ) is clinically effective in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) ; however , it frequently causes cardiotoxic effects . This study was designed to investigate whether ATO could induce apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs ) that play very important roles in maintaining the structure integrity and function of the heart . Cardiac fibroblasts from guinea pigs administered with ATO ( 1mg/kgbw ) were used to test the pro-apoptotic role of ATO in vivo . The current study demonstrated that ATO induced morphological characteristics of apoptosis and P42574 activation in CFs of guinea pigs along with a significant up-regulation in TGF-β1 protein expression , Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and P27361 /2 phosphorylation . In vitro MTT assay showed that ATO remarkably reduced the viability of cultured cardiac fibroblasts ( NRCFs ) from neonatal rat in a concentration- and time-dependent manner . Consistent with the notions in vivo , ATO significantly induced the apoptosis in NRCFs , dramatically up-regulated TGF-β1 protein level and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in a time-dependent fashion and activated P42574 and P27361 /2 . Finally , pretreatment with LY364947 , an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling could apparently reverse these changes . We therefore conclude that TGF-β is functionally linked to P27361 /2 and that TGF-β signaling is responsible for ATO-induced CFs apoptosis , which provides a novel mechanism of ATO related cardiac toxicology . DB02901 interacts with P00533 /MAPK signalling and modulates P00533 levels in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells . P10275 ( AR ) signalling plays a pivotal role in prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression . However , androgen-mediated AR signalling is yet to be fully understood . P00533 and Q96HU1 kinase signalling pathways play predominant roles in AR function . Therefore , we investigated the interaction of P00533 signalling and AR activity in AR-positive LNCaP cells . We found that 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) and P01133 had a synergistic effect on AR activity as detected by a luciferase reporter system , although P01133 alone did not activate AR . Both P27361 /2 and p38 were involved in DB02901 and DB02901 / P01133 -induced AR activation as detected by specific MEK and p38 inhibitors . Furthermore , 24-h treatment of the cells with DB02901 resulted in ubiquitination and down-regulation of the P00533 . This effect could be inhibited by the anti-androgen flutamide , suggesting an androgen-dependent mechanism . On the other hand , DB02901 -treatment strongly increased AR levels in LNCaP cells . These data suggest a complex regulatory loop between activated AR and P00533 . In conclusion , activation of AR by both DB02901 and P01133 / DB02901 involves the Q96HU1 kinase pathway . Long-term activation of AR results in increase of AR levels , which through so far unknown regulatory mechanisms results in ubiquitination and degradation of the P00533 . Is phentermine an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase ? A critical appraisal . DB00191 produces a spectrum of concentration-dependent biochemical effects . It interacts with NE transporters at 0.1 microM , DA transporters at about 1 microM , 5-HT transporters at 15 microM and P21397 at about 100 microM . When administered at typical anorectic doses , phentermine primarily interacts with DA and NE transporters and does not produce biochemical or neurochemical effects which would occur if it were inhibiting P21397 . Some other explanation other than MAO inhibition must be sought to explain how oral phentermine increases platelet 5-HT , since platelet P27338 does not metabolize platelet 5-HT , and since amphetamine-type drugs are even weaker inhibitors of P27338 than P21397 . Clinical studies in humans have shown that amphetamine , which is a more potent inhibitor of P21397 than phentermine , does not inhibit P21397 at therapeutic doses . Neither phentermine alone , fluoxetine alone or their combined use have been associated with cardiac valvulopathy , and clinical experience has shown their combined use to be free of significant adverse effects . Viewed collectively , there appears to be no data to support the hypothesis that phentermine inhibits MAO at typical therapeutic doses . Antitumor activity of arsenic trioxide on retinoblastoma : cell differentiation and apoptosis depending on arsenic trioxide concentration . PURPOSE : DB01169 ( ATO ) targets multiple pathways in malignant cells , resulting in the promotion of differentiation or in the induction of apoptosis . The antitumor activity of ATO on retinoblastoma was investigated . METHODS : Human retinoblastoma cells were incubated with various ATO concentrations . The antiproliferative effect of ATO was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay , and the effect of ATO on cell-cycle progression was validated by flow cytometry . At a low concentration , the ATO-induced differentiation of retinoblastoma cells was evaluated by neurofilament expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 activation , which was confirmed by the inhibition of P27361 /2 . At a high concentration , ATO-induced H(2)O(2) production was investigated with the cell-permeable fluorescent dye 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate , and the relationship of ATO-induced H(2)O(2) production with caspase-3-dependent apoptosis was validated by Western blot and 4'6-diamidino-2-phenolindole staining , which was confirmed by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) inhibition . The effect of ATO on tumor formation was assessed with an orthotopic animal model of retinoblastoma . RESULTS : The antitumor activity of ATO in retinoblastoma was related to two main mechanisms , differentiation and apoptosis , which were determined by the level of ATO . At a low dose ( < or= 1 microM ) , ATO induced the differentiation of retinoblastoma cells through P27361 /2 activation , whereas ROS generation by a high dose ( > or= 2 microM ) of ATO induced apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells . Moreover , ATO at low and high doses effectively inhibited tumor formation . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that ATO can be used as an effective alternative therapeutic for the treatment of retinoblastoma . Evaluation of neprilysin sequence variation in relation to P04141 β-Amyloid levels and Alzheimer disease risk . P08473 ( NEP ) is a principal peptidase involved in the degradation of β-amyloid ( Aβ ) , and as such its encoding gene ( MME ) has been the target of numerous genetic association studies on Alzheimer disease . Here , in order to attempt replication of previous findings we have investigated several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) that have been claimed to be associated with AD . A key feature of the present study is the complementary investigation of both AD risk and quantitative measures of AD severity , including cerebrospinal ( P04141 ) fluid levels of P05412 -42 . In contrast to the effects of P02649 , none of these measures are detectably influenced by genetic polymorphism in the MME region . We thus , fail to find support for previous results suggesting that MME impacts AD . P00533 regulates osteoclast differentiation and survival through cross-talking with Q9Y6Q6 signaling . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) functions in various cellular physiological processes such as proliferation , differentiation , and motility . Although recent studies have reported that P00533 signaling is involved in osteoclast recruitment and formation , the molecular mechanism of P00533 signaling for the regulation of osteoclastogenesis remains unclear . We investigated the role of the P00533 in osteoclast differentiation and survival and show that the expression of the P00533 was highly up-regulated by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) during osteoclast differentiation . P00533 -specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors and P00533 knockdown blocked O14788 -dependent osteoclast formation , suggesting that P00533 signaling plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis . P00533 inhibition impaired the O14788 -mediated activation of osteoclastogenic signaling pathways , including c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , NF-kappaB , and Akt/protein kinase B ( P31749 ) . In addition , P00533 inhibition in differentiated osteoclasts caused apoptosis through caspase activation . Inhibition of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase ( PI3K ) -Akt/ P31749 pathway and subsequent activation of Q92934 and caspases-9 and -3 may be responsible for the P00533 inhibition-induced apoptosis . The P00533 physically associated with receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ( Q9Y6Q6 ) and Grb2-associated binder 2 ( Gab2 ) . Moreover , O14788 transactivated P00533 . These data indicate that P00533 regulates O14788 -activated signaling pathways by cross-talking with Q9Y6Q6 , suggesting that the P00533 may play a crucial role as a Q9Y6Q6 downstream signal and/or a novel type of Q9Y6Q6 co-receptor in osteoclast differentiation and survival . Muscarinic cholinergic signaling in cervical cancer cells affects cell motility via P27361 /2 signaling . AIMS : The etiology of cervical cancer depends primarily on infection with human papillomaviruses , but tobacco smoking is the most important behavioral risk factor for this cancer . Therefore , we have previously confirmed involvement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) in cervical cancer biology . In order to comprehensively evaluate the role of cholinergic signaling in cervical cells , we have addressed additional participation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors ( mAChRs ) . MAIN METHODS : We have studied the expression of mAChRs and cholinergic system components by reverse transcription PCR and Western blots , the motility of cervical cancer cells in cell culture , and the signaling from mAChRs via the P27361 /2 signaling pathway . KEY FINDINGS : The cervical cancer cells HeLa , SiHa and CaSki express four of the five mAChRs , M1 , M3 , M4 , and M5 , and the acetylcholine ( ACh ) synthesizing and degrading enzymes choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) , acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , and butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) , and vesicular ACh transporter ( Q16572 ). mAChR-dependent signaling induces cervical cell motility , which requires P27361 /2 activation , and could be abrogated by mAChR antagonists . SIGNIFICANCE : The epidemiological finding that tobacco smoke raises the prevalence of cervical cancer has led to analysis of the cholinergic signaling in cervical biology and carcinogenesis . Cervical cancer cells express several nAChRs and mAChRs , whose activation leads to changes of cellular properties such as increased motility and proliferation that favor a carcinogenic phenotype . The signaling involves intracellular phosphorylation cascades including P27361 /2 . A new algorithm for weekly phenprocoumon dose variation in a southern Brazilian population : role for P11712 , P08684 /5 and Q9BQB6 genes polymorphisms . DB00946 is widely used in prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders . However , its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics vary according to several genetic and non-genetic factors . DB00946 metabolism is mediated by P11712 and CYP3A enzymes . Moreover , Q9BQB6 is phenprocoumon target of action . Therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in Q9BQB6 , P11712 , P08684 and P20815 genes with the variance of weekly phenprocoumon dose as well as to develop an algorithm for dose prediction based on genetic and environmental factors . A total of 198 patients with stable phenprocoumon dose , 81 % of European ancestry , were investigated . Genotypes were determined by allelic discrimination with TaqMan assays . Polymorphisms -1639G > A and 1173C > T in Q9BQB6 and the presence of P11712 *2 and/or P11712 *3 are associated with lower doses . On the other hand , 3730G > A in Q9BQB6 gene is associated with higher doses . No association was found between P08684 *1B , P20815 *3 and P20815 *6 polymorphisms . Among non-genetic factors , gender , height , age and use of captopril , omeprazole , simvastatin and β-blockers are associated with dose . Two algorithms were derived : one for the whole sample explained 42 % of dose variation and one for patients of European ancestry only which explained 46 % of phenprocoumon dose . The mean absolute difference between observed and predicted dose was low in both models ( 3.92 mg/week and 3.54 mg/week , for models 1 and 2 , respectively ) . However , more studies with other genes and environmental factors are needed to test and to improve the algorithm . DB00184 consumption is regulated by a human polymorphism in dopamine neurons . Smoking is the most important preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide . Recent genome-wide association studies highlighted a human haplotype on chromosome 15 underlying the risk for tobacco dependence and lung cancer . Several polymorphisms in the P32297 - P30532 - P30926 cluster coding for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) α3 , α5 and β4 subunits were implicated . In mouse models , we define a key role in the control of sensitivity to nicotine for the α5 subunit in dopaminergic ( DAergic ) neurons of the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) . We first investigated the reinforcing effects of nicotine in drug-naive α5(-/-) mice using an acute intravenous nicotine self-administration task and ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiological recordings of nicotine-elicited DA cell activation . We designed lentiviral re-expression vectors to achieve targeted re-expression of wild-type or mutant α5 in the VTA , in general , or in DA neurons exclusively . Our results establish a crucial role for α5*-nAChRs in DAergic neurons . These receptors are key regulators that determine the minimum nicotine dose necessary for DA cell activation and thus nicotine reinforcement . Finally , we demonstrate that a single-nucleotide polymorphism , the non-synonymous α5 variant rs16969968 , frequent in many human populations , exhibits a partial loss of function of the protein in vivo . This leads to increased nicotine consumption in the self-administration paradigm . We thus define a critical link between a human predisposition marker , its expression in DA neurons and nicotine intake . A common haplotype of the nicotine acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit gene is associated with vulnerability to nicotine addiction in men . DB00184 is the major addictive substance in cigarettes , and genes involved in sensing nicotine are logical candidates for vulnerability to nicotine addiction . We studied six single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the P43681 gene and four SNPs in the P17787 gene with respect to nicotine dependence in a collection of 901 subjects ( 815 siblings and 86 parents ) from 222 nuclear families with multiple nicotine-addicted siblings . The subjects were assessed for addiction by both the Fagerstrom Test for DB00184 Dependence ( FTND ) and the Revised Tolerance Questionnaire ( RTQ ) . Because only 5.8 % of female offspring were smokers , only male subjects were included in the final analyses ( 621 men from 206 families ) . Univariate ( single-marker ) family-based association tests ( FBATs ) demonstrated that variant alleles at two SNPs , rs1044396 and rs1044397 , in exon 5 of the P43681 gene were significantly associated with a protective effect against nicotine addiction as either a dichotomized trait or a quantitative phenotype ( i.e. , age-adjusted FTND and RTQ scores ) , which was consistent with the results of the global haplotype FBAT . Furthermore , the haplotype-specific FBAT showed a common ( 22.5 % ) P43681 haplotype , GCTATA , which was significantly associated with both a protective effect against nicotine addiction as a dichotomized trait ( Z=-3.04 , P < .005 ) and significant decreases of age-adjusted FTND ( Z=-3.31 , P < .005 ) or RTQ scores ( Z=-2.73 , P=.006 ) . Our findings provide strong evidence suggesting a common P43681 haplotype might be protective against vulnerability to nicotine addiction in men . Gene clustering analysis in human osteoporosis disease and modifications of the jawbone . OBJECTIVE : An analysis of the genes involved in both osteoporosis and modifications of the jawbone , through text mining , using a web search tool , of information regarding gene/protein interaction . DESIGN : The final set of genes involved in the present phenomenon was obtained by expansion-filtering loop . Using a web-available software ( STRING ) , interactions among all genes were searched for , and a clustering procedure was performed in which only high-confidence predicted associations were considered . RESULTS : Two hundred forty-two genes potentially involved in osteoporosis and in modifications of the jawbone were recorded . Seven " leader genes " were identified ( P35222 , P01584 , P05231 , P05412 , Q13950 , P10451 , P01137 ) , while another 10 genes formed the cluster B group ( P12643 , P18075 , P02452 , P05362 , IGF1 , P22301 , P14780 , P19838 , O14788 , P15692 ) . Ninety-eight genes had no interactions , and were defined as " orphan genes " . CONCLUSIONS : The expansion of knowledge regarding the molecular basis causing osteoporotic traits has been brought about with the help of a de novo identification , based on the data mining of genes involved in osteoporosis and in modification of the jawbone . A comparison of the present data , in which no role was verified for 98 genes that had been previously supposed to have a role , with that of the literature , in which another 81 genes , as obtained from GWAS reviews and meta-analyses , appeared to be strongly associated with osteoporosis , probably attests to a lack of information on osteoporotic disease . Overexpression of SnoN/SkiL , amplified at the 3q26.2 locus , in ovarian cancers : a role in ovarian pathogenesis . High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization of 235 serous epithelial ovarian cancers demonstrated a regional increase at 3q26.2 encompassing SnoN/SkiL , a coregulator of SMAD/TGFbeta signaling . SnoN RNA transcripts were elevated in approximately 80 % of advanced stage serous epithelial ovarian cancers . In both immortalized normal ( TIOSE ) and ovarian carcinoma cell lines ( OVCA ) , SnoN RNA levels were increased by TGFbeta stimulation and altered by LY294002 and JNK II inhibitor treatment suggesting that the PI3K and JNK signaling pathways may regulate TGFbeta-induced increases in SnoN RNA . In TIOSE , SnoN protein levels were reduced 15min post TGFbeta-stimulation , likely by proteosome-mediated degradation . In contrast , in OVCA , SnoN levels were elevated 3h post-stimulation potentially as a result of inhibition of the proteosome . To elucidate the role of SnoN in ovarian tumorigenesis , we explored the effects of both increasing and decreasing SnoN levels . In both TIOSE and OVCA , SnoN siRNA decreased cell growth between 20 and 50 % concurrent with increased P38936 levels . In TIOSE , transient expression of SnoN repressed TGFbeta induction of P05121 promoters with little effect on the P38936 promoter or resultant cell growth . In contrast to the effects of transient expression , stable expression of SnoN in TIOSE led to growth arrest through induction of senescence . Collectively , these results implicate SnoN levels in multiple roles during ovarian carcinogenesis : promoting cellular proliferation in ovarian cancer cells and as a positive mediator of cell cycle arrest and senescence in non-transformed ovarian epithelial cells . P30532 gene D398N polymorphism in Japanese lung adenocarcinoma . BACKGROUND : Recently , to identify genetic factors that modify lung cancer risk , P30532 non-synonymous variant amino acid position 398 ( D398N ) was identified . The site was a highly conserved in the second cellular loop of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit protein . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We have investigated P30532 gene polymorphism status in 302 surgically treated lung adenocarcinoma cases from Nagoya City University Hospital . The presence or absence of P30532 polymorphism was analyzed by direct sequences . P00533 mutations status was already investigated and reported . RESULTS : We detected nine cases ( 2.98 % ) of P30532 polymorphism ( D398N ) in our cohort . Total P00533 mutations were present in 129 patients ( 42.7 % ) . The polymorphism statuses were not correlated with gender ( women ; 2.1 % versus men ; 3.7 % , P = 0.5119 ) , smoking status ( never smoker ; 2.0 % versus smoker ; 4.0 % , P = 0.3339 ) , pathological stages ( stage I ; 2.6 % versus stage II-IV ; 3.8 % , P = 0.7246 ) , and P00533 mutation status of the lung adenocarcinomas ( mutation ; 2.3 % versus wild type ; 3.7 % , P = 0.7373 ) . In this analysis , P30532 polymorphism ( D398N ) patients had significantly worse prognosis ( 5/9 were dead ; mean survival = 27.1 mo ) than the patients with P30532 wild type ( 74/293 were dead ; mean survival = 113.9 mo ) ( log-rank test ; P = 0.0146 ) . CONCLUSION : Although P30532 polymorphism is rare from Japanese lung cancer , polymorphism status might be correlated with shorter survival . Synergistic inhibition of colon carcinoma cell growth by Hedgehog-Gli1 inhibitor arsenic trioxide and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 . The Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling pathway not only plays important roles in embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis , but also in tumorigenesis . Aberrant Hh pathway activation has been reported in a variety of malignant tumors including colon carcinoma . Here , we sought to investigate the regulation of the Hh pathway transcription factor Gli1 by arsenic trioxide and phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor LY294002 in colon carcinoma cells . We transfected cells with siGli1 and observed a significant reduction of Gli1 expression in HCT116 and HT29 cells , which was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blots . Knocking down endogenous Gli1 reduced colon carcinoma cell viability through inducing cell apoptosis . Similarly , knocking down Gli2 using short interfering RNA impaired colon carcinoma cell growth in vitro . To elucidate the regulation of Gli1 expression , we found that both Gli inhibitor arsenic trioxide and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly reduced Gli1 protein expression and colon carcinoma cell proliferation . DB01169 treatment also reduced Gli1 downstream target gene expression , such as Bcl2 and P24385 . More importantly , the inhibition of Hedgehog-Gli1 by arsenic trioxide showed synergistic anticancer effect with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in colon carcinoma cells . Our findings suggest that the Hh pathway transcription factor Gli1 is involved in the regulation of colon carcinoma cell viability . Inhibition of Hedgehog-Gli1 expression by arsenic trioxide and PI3K inhibitor synergistically reduces colon cancer cell proliferation , indicating that they could be used as an effective anti-colon cancer combination therapy . Analysis of breast cancer related gene expression using natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model to identify prognostic associations . Many studies correlating gene expression data to clinical parameters assume a linear increase or decrease of the clinical parameter under investigation with the expression of a gene . We have studied genes encoding important breast cancer-related proteins using a model for survival-type data that is based on natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model , thereby removing the linearity assumption . Expression data of 16 genes were studied in relation to metastasis-free probability in a cohort of 295 consecutive breast cancer patients treated at The Netherlands Cancer Institute . The independent predictive power for disease outcome of the 16 individual genes was tested in a multivariable model with known clinical and pathological risk factors . There is a linear relationship between increasing expression and a higher or lower hazard for distant metastasis for P03372 , Q15303 , P15692 , O96020 , Q15910 , and Q96NZ9 ; for P04626 , P21860 , P24385 , P24864 , O75530 , P61073 , P32248 , P48061 , and P05121 there is no clear increase or decrease ; and for P00533 there seems to be a non-linear relation . Multivariable analysis showed that the 70-gene prognosis profile outperforms all the other variables in the model ( hazard-rate 5.4 , 95 % CI 2.5-11.7 ; P = 0.000018 ) . P00533 -expression seems to have a non-linear relation with disease outcome , indicating that lower but also higher expression of P00533 are associated with worse outcome compared to intermediate expression levels ; the other genes show no or a linear relation . Genetic factors influencing outcome from neurotrauma . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Clinical outcome after neurotrauma is considerably variable and can only partly be explained by known prognostic factors . There is converging evidence from genetic research that a number of genetic variants may contribute to this variability . This review provides recent data from human studies , published in the previous year , on genetic factors influencing outcome after neurotrauma . The bibliographic databases MEDLINE , EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched to identify relevant studies . RECENT FINDINGS : Genetic susceptibility to various aspects of clinical outcome after neurotrauma was reported in recent clinical studies . Genetic loci investigated include polymorphisms in P02649 , P21397 , P23560 , NOS3 , P05231 , P12036 , P31645 , P21964 , P48454 and Q8IX03 genes . The importance of these findings and future directions are discussed . SUMMARY : Recent genetic studies have revealed emerging aspects and extended the existing knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of neurotrauma and the genetic influence on phenotypic diversity . A better understanding of the underlying biological pathways and molecular mechanisms of an individual 's response to neurotrauma may hold the promise of novel treatment strategies and improved clinical outcome . SnoN/SkiL expression is modulated via arsenic trioxide-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in ovarian cancer cells . SnoN/SkiL ( TGFβ regulator ) is dysregulated in ovarian cancer , a disease associated with acquired drug-resistance . DB01169 ( As₂O₃ , used in treating APL ) induces SnoN to oppose the apoptotic response in ovarian cancer cells . We now report that As₂O₃ increases phosphorylation of P00533 /p66ShcA and P00533 degradation . As₂O₃ activates Src(Y416) whose activity ( inhibited by Q99463 ) modulates P00533 activation , its interaction with Shc/Grb2 , and p-AKT . Inhibition of PI3K reduces SnoN and cell survival . Although P00533 or P28482 siRNA did not alter SnoN expression , As₂O₃-induced cleaved PARP was reduced together with increased P98170 . Collectively , As₂O₃ mediates an initial rise in pY-Src(416) to regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway which increases SnoN and cell survival ; these early events may counter the cell death response associated with increased pY- P00533 /MAPK activation . The effect of prenatal nicotine on mRNA of central cholinergic markers and hematological parameters in rat fetuses . A number of studies have demonstrated the influence of nicotine on fetal development . This study determined the expression of choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) , vesicular acetylcholine transporter ( Q16572 ) , and high-affinity choline transporter ( Q9GZV3 ) in the forebrain and hindbrain following chronic prenatal nicotine exposure in the rat fetus ( maternal rats were subcutaneously injected with nicotine at different gestation periods ) . We also measured the effect of chronic nicotine exposure on fetal blood pO(2) , pCO(2) , pH , Na(+) and K(+) concentrations , as well as lactic acid levels . Maternal nicotine exposure during pregnancy was associated with a decrease in fetal pO(2) coupled with a significant increase in pCO(2) and lactic acid as well as restricted fetal growth . Additionally , maternal nicotine administration also reduced P28329 , Q16572 , and Q9GZV3 mRNA levels in the fetal brain . DB00184 -induced fetal hypoxic responses and reduced cholinergic marker expression in the brain were more severe when nicotine was started in early gestation . Our results provide new information about the effects of repeated exposure to nicotine in utero on the expression of central P28329 , Q16572 , and Q9GZV3 in the rat fetus . These results indicate that repeated hypoxic episodes or/and a direct effect of nicotine on the central cholinergic system during pregnancy may contribute to brain developmental problems in fetal origin . DB01169 inhibits cell proliferation and human papillomavirus oncogene expression in cervical cancer cells . DB01169 ( As2O3 ) has shown therapeutic effects in some leukemias and solid cancers . However , the molecular mechanisms of its anticancer efficacy have not been clearly elucidated , particularly in solid cancers . Our previous data showed that As2O3 induced apoptosis of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) 16 DNA-immortalized human cervical epithelial cells and cervical cancer cells and inhibited the expression of HPV oncogenes in these cells . In the present study , we systemically examined the effects of As2O3 on five human cervical cancer cell lines and explored the possible molecular mechanisms . MTT assay showed that HPV-negative C33A cells were more sensitive to growth inhibition induced by As2O3 than HPV-positive cervical cancer cells , and HPV 18-positive HeLa and C4-I cells were more sensitive to As2O3 than HPV 16-positive CaSki and SiHa cells . After As2O3 treatment , both mRNA and protein levels of HPV E6 and E7 obviously decreased in all HPV positive cell lines . In contrast , p53 and Rb protein levels increased in all tested cell lines . P05412 protein expression decreased significantly in HeLa , CaSki and C33A cells with ELISA method . These results suggest that As2O3 is a potential anticancer drug for cervical cancer . Genetic markers in the EET metabolic pathway are associated with outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Preclinical studies show that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids ( EETs ) regulate cerebrovascular tone and protect against cerebral ischemia . We investigated the relationship between polymorphic genes involved in EET biosynthesis/metabolism , cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) eicosanoid levels , and outcomes in 363 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( DHET ) cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) levels , as well as acute outcomes defined by delayed cerebral ischemia ( P42126 ) or clinical neurologic deterioration ( CND ) , were assessed over 14 days . Long-term outcomes were defined by Modified Rankin Scale ( P59665 ) at 3 and 12 months . P10632 *4 allele carriers had 44 % and 36 % lower mean EET and DHET P04141 levels ( P=0.003 and P=0.007 ) and were 2.2- and 2.5-fold more likely to develop P42126 and CND ( P=0.039 and P=0.041 ) , respectively . P34913 55Arg , P51589 *7 , P10632 *1B , and P10632 g.36785A allele carriers had lower EET and DHET P04141 levels . P10632 g.25369T and P10632 g.36755A allele carriers had higher EET levels . Patients with P10632 *2C and P34913 404del variants had worse long-term outcomes while those with P34913 287Gln , P51589 *7 , and P11712 g.816G variants had favorable outcomes . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid levels were associated with Fisher grade and unfavorable 3-month outcomes . Dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were not associated with outcomes . No associations passed Bonferroni multiple testing correction . These are the first clinical data demonstrating the association between the EET biosynthesis/metabolic pathway and the pathophysiology of aSAH . DB03419 incorporation into genomic DNA does not predict toxicity caused by chemotherapeutic inhibition of thymidylate synthase . P04818 ( TS ) is an important target of several chemotherapeutic agents , including DB00544 and raltitrexed ( DB00293 ) . During TS inhibition , TTP levels decrease with a subsequent increase in dUTP . DB03419 incorporated into the genome is removed by base excision repair ( BER ) . Thus , BER initiated by uracil DNA glycosylase ( P13051 ) activity has been hypothesized to influence the toxicity induced by TS inhibitors . In this study we created a human cell line expressing the Ugi protein inhibitor of P13051 family of UDGs , which reduces cellular P13051 activity by at least 45-fold . Genomic uracil incorporation was directly measured by mass spectrometry following treatment with TS inhibitors . Genomic uracil levels were increased over 4-fold following TS inhibition in the Ugi-expressing cells , but did not detectably increase in P13051 proficient cells . Despite the difference in genomic uracil levels , there was no difference in toxicity between the P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells to folate or nucleotide-based inhibitors of TS . Cell cycle analysis showed that P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells arrested in early S-phase and resumed replication progression during recovery from RTX treatment almost identically . The induction of gamma- P16104 was measured following TS inhibition as a measure of whether uracil excision promoted DNA double strand break formation during S-phase arrest . Although gamma- P16104 was detectable following TS inhibition , there was no difference between P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells . We therefore conclude that uracil excision initiated by P13051 does not adequately explain the toxicity caused by TS inhibition in this model . DB00104 is the favorable alternative for cisplatin resistance reversal of ovarian cancer in vitro and in nude mice in vivo . This study aimed to observe the effects of octreotide ( O75051 ) on cisplatin resistance reversal of cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice in vivo . MTT method and flow cytometry were used to investigate the effect of cisplatin , O75051 or the combination of these two compounds on the proliferation and apoptosis of SKOV3- O60220 cells . The size and weight of xenograft tumors from the nude mice model were measured . Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of P30874 , P08183 , Q92887 , Q86UG4 -pi and P00533 in SKOV3/ O60220 cells following the different treatment . At the concentration of 2.5-20 g/ml , O75051 significantly reduced IC50 ( p < 0.05 ) and promoted apoptosis ( p < 0.05 ) of SKOV3- O60220 cells ' response to cisplatin . Unchanged expression was found in P30874 on the SKOV3/ O60220 cell in vitro after O75051 treatment , but increased expression in vivo ( p < 0.05 ) . O75051 increased Q86UG4 -pi expression ( p < 0.05 ) and reduced Q92887 and P00533 expression ( p < 0.05 ) in a dose-dependent manner . The similar results were obtained in mice in vivo experiment , except the reduced expression of Q86UG4 -pi . It is suggested that O75051 could inhibit ovarian cancer proliferation and promote apoptosis , via the cell surface P30874 , and reverse cisplatin resistance through inhibition of Q92887 , P00533 , and even Q86UG4 -pi expressions . Revelation of p53-independent function of Q13330 in DNA damage response via modulation of the P38936 P38936 -proliferating cell nuclear antigen pathway . Although metastasis-associated protein 1 ( Q13330 ) , a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase ( NuRD ) complex , is a DNA-damage response protein and regulates p53-dependent DNA repair , it remains unknown whether Q13330 also participates in p53-independent DNA damage response . Here , we provide evidence that Q13330 is a p53-independent transcriptional corepressor of P38936 ( P38936 ) , and the underlying mechanism involves recruitment of Q13330 -histone deacetylase 2 ( Q92769 ) complexes onto two selective regions of the P38936 ( P38936 ) promoter . Accordingly , Q13330 depletion , despite its effect on p53 down-regulation , superinduces P38936 ( P38936 ) , increases P38936 ( P38936 ) binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) , and decreases the nuclear accumulation of P12004 in response to ionizing radiation . In support of a p53-independent role of Q13330 in DNA damage response , we further demonstrate that induced expression of Q13330 in p53-null cells inhibits P38936 ( P38936 ) promoter activity and P38936 ( P38936 ) binding to P12004 . Consequently , Q13330 expression in p53-null cells results in increased induction of gamma P16104 foci and DNA double strand break repair , and decreased DNA damage sensitivity following ionizing radiation treatment . These findings uncover a new target of Q13330 and the existence of an additional p53-independent role of Q13330 in DNA damage response , at least in part , by modulating the P38936 ( P38936 )- P12004 pathway , and thus , linking two previously unconnected NuRD complex and DNA-damage response pathways . Activation status of receptor tyrosine kinase downstream pathways in primary lung adenocarcinoma with reference of P01116 and P00533 mutations . The activation status of signal transduction pathways involving receptor tyrosine kinases and its association with P00533 or P01116 mutations have been widely studied using cancer cell lines , although it is still uncertain in primary tumors . To study the activation status of main components of growth factor-induced pathways , phosphorylated Akt ( pAkt ) , extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( pERK ) and other downstream proteins were immunohistochemically examined using surgical samples of 193 primary lung adenocarcinomas . Also , thyroid transcription factor-1 ( Q15669 -1 ) expression and mutation status of P00533 and P01116 were examined . Advanced tumor stages ( p < 0.001 ) , negative Q15669 -1 expression ( p < 0.001 ) and Akt activation ( p=0.015 ) were independent and significant poor prognostic markers . Akt activation related to advanced stage ( p=0.021 ) , invasiveness ( p=0.004 ) , and not to mutations . Q15669 -1 expression associated with never-smoker ( p=0.013 ) , pre- or minimally invasiveness ( p < 0.001 ) and P00533 mutations ( p=0.017 ) as well as with pERK ( p=0.039 ) expression . P00533 mutations did not correlated with pAkt and pERK expression , which was different from the results based on cultured cells , while P01116 mutations were solely and significantly linked to P29323 activation ( p=0.009 ) . In lung adenocarcinoma , tumors with Q15669 -1 expression have distinct characteristics regarding mutations , signal protein activation and clinical issues . Moreover , this property was revealed to be important in outcome estimation at any tumor stage , whereas Akt activation is abnormally affected according to the tumor stage regardless of their cell origin . The signal proteins were differently related to mutation status from cultured cells . Molecular targeting therapy against promyelocytic leukemia protein using arsenic acids in experimental intracranial medulloblastoma . Our previous study using human Daoy medulloblastoma cells showed that the promyelocytic leukemia ( P29590 ) gene was significantly upregulated ( 2.5-fold ) in cells positive to prominin-1 antigen ( CD133 ) , a possible marker for cancer initiating cells . DB01169 ( As(2)O(3) ) is known to degrade P29590 protein and has been used for the treatment of patients with acute P29590 . In the present study , the effect of P29590 targeting therapy with As(2)O(3) and cytarabine ( DB00987 ) on Daoy medulloblastoma cell proliferation was investigated . Daoy cells were pretreated with As(2)O(3) for 6 weeks . The As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells were cultured in medium containing DB00987 and cell viability was examined . Next , the As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells were inoculated into the nude mouse brain and the effect of DB00987 on the tumor size was evaluated . A significant increase in chemosensitivity to DB00987 was observed in the As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells in both in vitro and in vivo conditions . P29590 and P24385 ( cyclin D1 ) protein expression of Daoy medulloblastoma cells was downregulated by As(2)O(3) treatment . P29590 has been proposed as a novel therapeutic target to eradicate quiescent leukemia-initiating cells , and P29590 -expressing CD133-positive cells are similarly a potential therapeutic target of treatment for medulloblastoma .
P36888 ligand impedes the efficacy of P36888 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo . We examined in vivo P36888 inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with chemotherapy followed by the P36888 inhibitor lestaurtinib , comparing newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients with relapsed patients . Because we noted that in vivo P36888 inhibition by lestaurtinib was less effective in the relapsed patients compared with the newly diagnosed patients , we investigated whether plasma P36888 ligand ( FL ) levels could influence the efficacy of P36888 inhibition in these patients . After intensive chemotherapy , FL levels rose to a mean of 488 pg/mL on day 15 of induction therapy for newly diagnosed patients , whereas they rose to a mean of 1148 pg/mL in the relapsed patients . FL levels rose even higher with successive courses of chemotherapy , to a mean of 3251 pg/mL after the fourth course . In vitro , exogenous FL at concentrations similar to those observed in patients mitigated P36888 inhibition and cytotoxicity for each of 5 different P36888 inhibitors ( lestaurtinib , midostaurin , sorafenib , KW-2449 , and DB05213 ) . The dramatic increase in FL level after chemotherapy represents a possible obstacle to inhibiting P36888 in this clinical setting . These findings could have important implications regarding the design and outcome of trials of P36888 inhibitors and furthermore suggest a rationale for targeting FL as a therapeutic strategy . Insights into antifolate resistance from malarial P00374 -TS structures . Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase ( PfDHFR-TS ) is an important target of antimalarial drugs . The efficacy of this class of P00374 -inhibitor drugs is now compromised because of mutations that prevent drug binding yet retain enzyme activity . The crystal structures of PfDHFR-TS from the wild type ( TM4/8.2 ) and the quadruple drug-resistant mutant ( V1/S ) strains , in complex with a potent inhibitor WR99210 , as well as the resistant double mutant ( P04264 P21554 ) with the antimalarial pyrimethamine , reveal features for overcoming resistance . In contrast to pyrimethamine , the flexible side chain of WR99210 can adopt a conformation that fits well in the active site , thereby contributing to binding . The single-chain bifunctional PfDHFR-TS has a helical insert between the P00374 and TS domains that is involved in dimerization and domain organization . Moreover , positively charged grooves on the surface of the dimer suggest a function in channeling of substrate from TS to P00374 active sites . These features provide possible approaches for the design of new drugs to overcome antifolate resistance . Anandamide regulates the expression of GnRH1 , GnRH2 , and DB00644 -Rs in frog testis . DB00644 ( either GnRH1 or GnRH2 ) exerts a local activity in vertebrate testis , including human testis . Relationships between endocannabinoid ( eCB ) and DB00644 systems in gonads have never been elucidated in any species so far . To reveal a cross-talk between eCBs and DB00644 at testicular level , we characterized the expression of DB00644 ( GnRH1 and GnRH2 ) as well as P30968 ( DB00644 - Q96GN5 , -R2 , and -R3 ) mRNA in the testis of the anuran amphibian Rana esculenta during the annual sexual cycle ; furthermore , the corresponding transcripts were localized inside the testis by in situ hybridization . The possible endogenous production of the eCB , anandamide ( AEA ) , was investigated in testis by analyzing the expression of its biosynthetic enzyme , Nape-pld . Incubations of testis pieces with AEA were carried out in the postreproductive period ( June ) and in February , when a new spermatogenetic wave takes place . In June , AEA treatment significantly decreased GnRH1 and DB00644 -R2 mRNA , stimulated the transcription of GnRH2 and DB00644 - Q96GN5 , and did not affect DB00644 -R3 expression . In February , AEA treatment upregulated GnRH2 and DB00644 -R3 mRNA , downregulated DB00644 -R2 , and did not affect GnRH1 and DB00644 - Q96GN5 expression . These effects were mediated by type 1 cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) since they were fully counteracted by SR141716A ( DB06155 ) , a selective P21554 antagonist . In conclusion , eCB system modulates DB00644 activity in frog testis during the annual sexual cycle in a stage-dependent fashion . Biomarker analysis of neoadjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by ixabepilone or Paclitaxel in early-stage breast cancer . PURPOSE : Predictive biomarkers offer the potential to improve the benefit:risk ratio of a therapeutic agent . DB04845 achieves comparable pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rates to other active drugs in the neoadjuvant setting . This phase II trial was designed to investigate potential biomarkers that differentiate response to this agent . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Women with untreated , histologically confirmed primary invasive breast adenocarcinoma received neoadjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide , followed by 1:1 randomization to ixabepilone ( n = 148 ) or paclitaxel ( n = 147 ) . Rates of pCR were compared between treatment arms based on predefined biomarker sets : Q13509 , Q9Y6A5 , and CAPG gene expression , a 20- and 26-gene expression model , P08183 protein expression , and other potential markers of sensitivity . βIII-tubulin protein expression is reported separately but is referred to here for completeness . All patients underwent a core needle biopsy of the primary cancer for molecular marker analysis before chemotherapy . Gene expression profiling data were used for molecular subtyping . RESULTS : There was no significant difference in the rate of pCR in both treatment arms in βIII-tubulin-positive patients . Higher pCR rates were observed among βIII-tubulin-positive patients than in βIII-tubulin-negative patients . Furthermore , no correlation was evident between Q13509 , Q9Y6A5 , and CAPG gene expression , P08183 protein expression , multi-gene expression models , and the efficacy of ixabepilone or paclitaxel , even within the estrogen receptor-negative subset . CONCLUSION : These results indicate that βIII-tubulin protein and mRNA expression , P08183 protein expression , Q9Y6A5 and CAPG gene expression , and multigene expression models ( 20- and 26-gene ) are not predictive markers for differentiating treatment benefit between ixabepilone and paclitaxel in early-stage breast cancer . A mechanism for the synergistic antimalarial action of atovaquone and proguanil . A combination of atovaquone and proguanil has been found to be quite effective in treating malaria , with little evidence of the emergence of resistance when atovaquone was used as a single agent . We have examined possible mechanisms for the synergy between these two drugs . While proguanil by itself had no effect on electron transport or mitochondrial membrane potential ( DeltaPsim ) , it significantly enhanced the ability of atovaquone to collapse DeltaPsim when used in combination . This enhancement was observed at pharmacologically achievable doses . DB01131 acted as a biguanide rather than as its metabolite cycloguanil ( a parasite dihydrofolate reductase [ P00374 ] inhibitor ) to enhance the atovaquone effect ; another P00374 inhibitor , pyrimethamine , also had no enhancing effect . DB01131 -mediated enhancement was specific for atovaquone , since the effects of other mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors , such as myxothiazole and antimycin , were not altered by inclusion of proguanil . Surprisingly , proguanil did not enhance the ability of atovaquone to inhibit mitochondrial electron transport in malaria parasites . These results suggest that proguanil in its prodrug form acts in synergy with atovaquone by lowering the effective concentration at which atovaquone collapses DeltaPsim in malaria parasites . This could explain the paradoxical success of the atovaquone-proguanil combination even in regions where proguanil alone is ineffective due to resistance . The results also suggest that the atovaquone-proguanil combination may act as a site-specific uncoupler of parasite mitochondria in a selective manner . The effects of rimonabant on brown adipose tissue in rat : implications for energy expenditure . The cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonist rimonabant ( SR 141716 ) produces a sustained decrease in body weight on a background of a transient reduction in food intake . An increase in energy expenditure has been implicated , possibly mediated via peripheral endocannabinoid system ; however , the role of the central endocannabinoid system is unclear . The present study investigates this role . DB06155 ( 10 mg/kg IP ) was administered for 21 days to rats surgically implanted with biotelemetry devices to measure temperature in the interscapular brown adipose tissue ( Q14032 ) . Q14032 temperature as a putative measure of thermogenesis in the Q14032 , physical activity , body weight , food intake , as well as changes in P25874 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein were measured . In addition , role of the CNS in mediating these actions of rimonabant was determined in rats where the Q14032 was sympathetically denervated . As expected , chronic administration of rimonabant significantly reduced body weight for the entire treatment period despite only a transient decrease in food intake . There was a profound increase in Q14032 temperature , particularly during the dark phase of each circadian cycle throughout the treatment period . A corresponding increase in uncoupling protein ( P25874 ) was also observed following chronic rimonabant treatment . The rimonabant-induced elevation in Q14032 temperature and decrease in body weight were significantly attenuated following denervation , indicating an involvement of the CNS . These findings suggest that the long-term weight loss associated with rimonabant treatment is due at least in part to an elevation in energy expenditure , represented here by elevated temperature recorded in the Q14032 , which is mediated primarily by the central endocannabinoid system . Unsaturated side chain beta-11-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol analogs . The cannabinoid side chain is a key pharmacophore in the interaction of cannabinoids with their receptors ( P21554 and CB2 ) . To study the stereochemical requirements of the side chain , we synthesized a series of cannabinoids in which rotation around the C1'- P06681 ' bond is blocked . The key steps in the synthesis were the cuprate addition of a substituted resorcinol to (+)-apoverbenone , the TMSOTf-mediated formation of the dihydropyran ring , and the stereospecific introduction of the beta-11-hydroxymethyl group . All the analogs tested showed nanomolar affinity for the receptors , the cis-hept-1-ene side chain having the highest affinity for P21554 ( Ki = 0.89 nM ) and showing the widest separation between P21554 and CB2 affinities . The parent n-heptyl-beta-11-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol was the least potent binding to P21554 ( Ki = 8.9 nM ) and had the lowest selectivity between P21554 and CB2 . Role of phospholipase D2 in the agonist-induced and constitutive endocytosis of G-protein coupled receptors . We have recently shown that the mu-opioid receptor [ P35372 , also termed mu-opioid peptide ( MOP ) receptor ] is associated with the phospholipase D2 ( O14939 ) , a phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase located in the plasma membrane . We further demonstrated that , in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells co-expressing P35372 and O14939 , treatment with ( D-Ala2 , Me Phe4 , Glyol5 ) enkephalin ( DAMGO ) led to an increase in O14939 activity and an induction of receptor endocytosis , whereas morphine , which does not induce opioid receptor endocytosis , failed to activate O14939 . In contrast , a C-terminal splice variant of the mu-opioid receptor ( MOR1D , also termed MOP(1D) ) exhibited robust endocytosis in response to both DAMGO and morphine treatment . We report here that MOR1D also mediates an agonist-independent ( constitutive ) O14939 -activation facilitating agonist-induced and constitutive receptor endocytosis . Inhibition of O14939 activity by over-expression of a dominant negative O14939 ( nPLD2 ) blocked the constitutive O14939 activation and impaired the endocytosis of MOR1D receptors . Moreover , we provide evidence that the endocytotic trafficking of the delta-opioid receptor [ Q8IXH6 , also termed delta-opioid peptide ( DOP ) receptor ] and cannabinoid receptor isoform 1 ( P21554 ) is also mediated by a O14939 -dependent pathway . These data indicate the generally important role for O14939 in the regulation of agonist-dependent and agonist-independent G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) endocytosis . Q07973 as a potential target for cancer therapy . Increasing evidence has accumulated to suggest that vitamin D may reduce the risk of cancer through its biologically active metabolite , DB00136 , which inhibits proliferation and angiogenesis , induces differentiation and apoptosis , and regulates many other cellular functions . Thus , it is plausible to assume that rapid clearance of DB00136 by highly expressed Q07973 could interrupt the normal physiology of cells and might be one cause of cancer initiation and progression . In fact , enhancement of Q07973 expression has been reported in literature for many cancers . Based on these findings , Q07973 -specific inhibitors and vitamin D analogs which are resistant to Q07973 -dependent catabolism might be useful for cancer treatment . Q07973 -specific inhibitor VID400 , which is an azole compound , markedly enhanced and prolonged the antiproliferative activity of DB00136 in the human keratinocytes . Likewise , Q07973 -resistant analogs such as 2α-(3-hydroxypropoxy)- DB00136 ( O2C3 ) and its P06681 -epimer ED-71 ( DB05295 ) , and 19nor- 2α-(3-hydroxypropyl)- DB00136 ( MART-10 ) showed potent biological effects . Our in vivo studies using rats revealed that MART-10 had a low calcemic effect , which is a suitable property as an anticancer drug . Much lower affinity of MART-10 for vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) as compared with DB00136 may be related to its more potent cellular activities . Based on these results , we conclude that ( 1 ) high affinity for P11473 , ( 2 ) resistance to Q07973 -dependent catabolism , ( 3 ) low affinity for DBP , and ( 4 ) low calcemic effect may be required for designing potent vitamin D analogs for cancer treatment . Sensitivity toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors varies between different activating mutations of the P36888 receptor . Activating mutations of P36888 have been detected in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Two distinct types of P36888 mutations are most common : internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) of sequences coding for the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations at codon 835 ( Asp835 ) within the kinase domain . Both types of mutations constitutively activate the tyrosine kinase activity of P36888 in experimental systems and result in factor-independent proliferation of Ba/ P13726 and 32D cells . Recently , novel mutations within the activation loop were identified in patients with AML : deletion of isoleucine 836 ( Ile836del ) and an exchange of isoleucine 836 to methionine plus an arginine insertion ( Ile836Met+ DB00125 ) . To examine whether the Ile836 mutations result in constitutive activation of the P36888 receptor , we introduced both mutant P36888 cDNAs transiently into P29320 293 cells . Both mutant P36888 receptors were constitutively autophosphorylated in the absence of ligand and kinase activity led to constitutive activation of downstream signaling cascades as determined by activation of the P42229 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ) pathway . When stably expressed in the growth factor-dependent cell lines Ba/ P13726 and 32D , both deletion and insertion mutants led to factor-independent proliferation , indicating that both mutants have transforming capabilities . We then examined the sensitivity of the P36888 ITD , P36888 Asp835Tyr , and the novel P36888 receptor mutants toward the kinase inhibitors AG1296 , PKC412 , and SU5614 . We show that these P36888 kinase inhibitors have distinct inhibitory potencies against different activating P36888 receptor mutants . These results suggest that it may be useful to determine the exact kind of P36888 mutation when applying receptor kinase inhibitors in clinical trials . Expression profiles of mitochondrial genes in the frontal cortex and the caudate nucleus of developing humans and mice selectively bred for high and low fear . A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial function may be important in brain development and psychiatric disorders . However , detailed expression profiles of those genes in human brain development and fear-related behavior remain unclear . Using microarray data available from the public domain and the Gene Ontology analysis , we identified the genes and the functional categories associated with chronological age in the prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) and the caudate nucleus ( CN ) of psychiatrically normal humans ranging in age from birth to 50 years . Among those , we found that a substantial number of genes in the P27918 ( 115 ) and the CN ( 117 ) are associated with the GO term : mitochondrion ( FDR qv < 0.05 ) . A greater number of the genes in the P27918 ( 91 % ) than the genes in the CN ( 62 % ) showed a linear increase in expression during postnatal development . Using quantitative PCR , we validated the developmental expression pattern of four genes including monoamine oxidase B ( P27338 ) , DB00157 dehydrogenase flavoprotein ( P49821 ) , mitochondrial uncoupling protein 5 ( O95258 ) and tubulin beta-3 chain ( Q13509 ) . In mice , overall developmental expression pattern of P27338 , O95258 and Q13509 in the P27918 were comparable to the pattern observed in humans ( p < 0.05 ) . However , mice selectively bred for high fear did not exhibit normal developmental changes of P27338 and Q13509 . These findings suggest that the genes associated with mitochondrial function in the P27918 play a significant role in brain development and fear-related behavior . Searching for a marker for Alzheimer 's disease- P02649 . The authors present their study of 10 patients affected by Alzheimer 's disease and 10 patients with multinfarctual dementia , who are already part of a P21554 study , senile dementia project , longitudinal study . The method adopted was that of DNA crossbreeding and amplification , so as to have a precise individualisation of alleles APo-E , Apo E-3 , Apo E-4 and of their various phenotype combinations . These isoforms are evaluated and compared with the disease studied , in order to help to identify a timely-marker for senile dementia . On the results obtained we hypothesised an association between Apo E-4 and the disease of about 40 % for Alzheimer 's disease , which leads us to increase our number of cases , regarding associations between demential diseases either Alzheimer or vascular and the presence of Apo E-4 . DB02709 protects against peripheral deficits in a mouse model of Huntington 's disease . Sirtuins are NAD-dependent deacetylases that regulate important biologic processes including transcription , cell survival and metabolism . Activation of Q96EB6 , a mammalian sirtuin , extends longevity and increases neuronal survival . An important substrate of Q96EB6 is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1alpha ( P20142 -1alpha ) , a principal regulator of energy metabolism , whose function is significantly impaired in Huntington 's disease ( HD ) . We studied the effects of a pharmacological preparation of the Q96EB6 activator resveratrol ( DB05073 -M ) , in the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model of HD . We analyzed motor performance , survival , central and peripheral pathology and levels of P20142 -1alpha expression . Administration of DB05073 -M increased expression of P20142 -1alpha , as well as its downstream targets , nuclear respiratory factor-1 ( Q16656 ) and uncoupling protein-1 ( P25874 -1 ) in brown adipose tissue ( Q14032 ) , but there was no effect on P20142 -1alpha , Q16656 or the mitochondrial transcription factor ( Tfam ) in the striatum . DB05073 -M administration also reduced Q14032 vacuolation and decreased elevated blood glucose levels . However , there was no significant improvement in weight loss , motor performance , survival and striatal atrophy . Activation of the P20142 -1alpha signaling pathway via resveratrol-induced activation of Q96EB6 , therefore , is an effective therapy in Q14032 , but not in the central nervous system of HD transgenic mice . AM2389 , a high-affinity , in vivo potent P21554 -receptor-selective cannabinergic ligand as evidenced by drug discrimination in rats and hypothermia testing in mice . RATIONALE : The endocannabinoid signaling system ( ECS ) has been targeted for developing novel therapeutics since ECS dysfunction has been implicated in various pathologies . Current focus is on chemical modifications of the hexahydrocannabinol ( HHC ) nabilone ( DB00486 (®) ) . OBJECTIVE : To characterize the novel , high-affinity cannabinoid receptor 1 ( CB(1)R ) HHC-ligand AM2389 [ 9β-hydroxy-3-(1-hexyl-cyclobut-1-yl)-hexahydrocannabinol in two rodent pre-clinical assays . MATERIALS AND METHODS : CB(1)R mediation of AM2389-induced hypothermia in mice was evaluated with AM251 , a CB(1)R-selective antagonist/inverse agonist . Additionally , two groups of rats discriminated the full cannabinergic aminoalkylindole AM5983 ( 0.18 and 0.56 mg/kg ) from vehicle 20 min post-injection in a two-choice operant conditioning task motivated by 0.1 % saccharin/water . Generalization/substitution tests were conducted with AM2389 , AM5983 , and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ(9)-THC ) . RESULTS : Δ(9)-THC (30 mg/kg)-induced hypothermia exhibited a faster onset and shorter duration of action compared with AM2389 ( 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg ) . AM251 ( 3 and 10 mg/kg ) attenuated/blocked hypothermia induced by 0.3 mg/kg AM2389 . In drug discrimination , the order of potency was AM2389 > AM5983 > Δ(9)-THC with ED(50) values of 0.0025 , 0.0571 , and 0.2635 mg/kg , respectively , in the low-dose condition . The corresponding ED(50) values in the high-dose condition were 0.0069 , 0.1246 , and 0.8438 mg/kg , respectively . Onset of the effects of AM2389 was slow with a protracted time-course ; the functional , perceptual in vivo half-life was approximately 17 h . CONCLUSIONS : This potent cannabinergic HHC exhibited a slow onset of action with a protracted time-course . The AM2389 chemotype appears well suited for further drug development , and AM2389 currently is used to probe behavioral consequences of sustained ECS activation . Possible involvement of endocannabinoids in the increase of morphine consumption in maternally deprived rat . Whether adolescent exposure to chronic DB00470 ( THC ) facilitates progression to opioid consumption is still controversial . In a maternal deprivation model ( 3 h daily from postnatal day 1-14 ) , we previously reported that adolescent exposure to chronic THC blocks morphine dependence in maternally deprived ( D ) rats . Owing to the existence of a functional cross-interaction between the opioid and cannabinoid systems in reward , we evaluated if the vulnerability to opiate reward in D rats , may involve an alteration of the endocannabinoid system . Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol ( 2-AG ) , were quantified in the striatum and mesencephalon of adolescent and adult D and non-deprived ( animal facility rearing , AFR ) rats by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . Oral morphine self-administration behavior was analyzed for 14 weeks , 24 days after chronic injection of the cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist , SR141716A ( 3 mg/kg ) for 2 weeks during adolescence ( P01160 35-48 ) . Adolescent D rats exhibited higher basal levels of anandamide than adolescent AFR rats in the nucleus accumbens ( 38 % ) , the caudate-putamen nucleus ( 62 % ) and the mesencephalon ( 320 % ) , whereas adult D rats showed an increase of anandamide and 2-AG levels in the nucleus accumbens ( 50 % and 24 % , respectively ) and of 2-AG in the caudate-putamen nucleus ( 48 % ) , compared to adult AFR rats . Chronic administration of SR141716A to adolescent D rats blocked the escalation behavior in the morphine consumption test . Our data suggest that altered brain endocannabinoid levels may contribute to the escalation behavior in the morphine consumption test in a maternal deprivation model . Lack of direct action of atriopeptidase inhibitor on cellular pH regulation in rabbit S2 proximal straight tubules . While the in vivo diuretic and antihypertensive effects of the newly-developed drug DB00616 ( UK-79300 ) , a prodrug of a selective atriopeptidase inhibitor UK-73967 ( DB00058 ) are well established , the mechanism of its diuretic action is not yet fully understood due to the lack of information about its direct effects on proximal tubules . To elucidate whether this atriopeptidase inhibitor has any direct effects on proximal tubules , we examined the effect of DB00058 on intracellular pH ( pHi ) of the in vitro microperfused proximal S2 segment of rabbit kidney , using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye , (2',7')-bis(carboxyethyl)-(5,6)-carboxyfluorescein ( BCECF ) . In the steady-state condition , pHi was 7.13 +/- 0.02 ( n = 19 ) . P08473 inhibitor ( DB00058 ) at 100 microM added to the bath changed pHi by only 0.02 +/- 0.07 unit ( n = 7 , p > 0.05 ) in 10 min . The same concentration of DB00058 in the lumen changed pHi by 0.03 +/- 0.02 unit ( n = 6 , p > 0.05 ) . To test whether the synergistic effects of DB00058 on the luminal and basolateral transport systems prevented the apparent change in pHi , we also examined the effect of DB00058 in the presence of amiloride in the lumen . The inhibition of Na+/H+ antiporter by the addition of 1 mM of amiloride to the lumen caused no change in pHi response to basolateral DB00058 application . DB00058 was without effect on pHi also in the presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide ( P01160 ) . These results suggest that DB00058 per se has no significant effect on the process of proximal acidification over a short time period . Opioid and neurotransmitter regulation of pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) receptors in the ovariectomized estradiol-treated rat : role of altered DB00644 secretion . An acute transient fall in the number of pituitary DB00644 receptors ( P30968 ) is observed before the preovulatory gonadotropin surge in cycling rats and before the afternoon daily gonadotropin surge in ovariectomized estradiol-treated rats . In the latter model , this fall can be reproduced by administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone , whereas the opioid agonist morphine acutely increases P30968 . In this study we investigated the mechanisms of this opioid effect and examined the effects of other neurotransmitter substances on modulation of pituitary P30968 . Administration of the dopaminergic agonists bromocriptine and L-dopa or the alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker phenoxybenzamine elevated P30968 acutely from average basal values of 240 +/- 22 and 254 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein to maximal values of 374 +/- 49 , 441 +/- 67 and 461 +/- 75 fmol/mg , respectively , whereas the alpha-adrenergic agonist clonidine transiently decreased P30968 to 186 +/- 19 fmol/mg . Placement of radiofrequency lesions in the mediobasal hypothalamus or pretreatment with anti- DB00644 serum completely abolished the ability of both morphine and naloxone to modulate the number of P30968 . These data indicate that the opioid-induced modulation of pituitary P30968 requires an intact hypothalamus and that both dopaminergic and alpha-adrenergic neurotransmitter systems may be involved . The final step of this action probably involves acute modulation of DB00644 secretion ( altered frequency and/or amplitude ) , which results in acute transient changes in the number of pituitary P30968 . Alpha 2B adrenoceptor genotype moderates effect of reboxetine on negative emotional memory bias in healthy volunteers . Evidence suggests that emotional memory plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression/anxiety disorders . DB00368 crucially modulates emotional memory . Genetic variants involved in noradrenergic signaling contribute to individual differences in emotional memory and vulnerability to psychopathology . A functional deletion polymorphism in the α-2B adrenoceptor gene ( P18089 ) has been linked to emotional memory and post-traumatic stress disorder . The noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine attenuates enhanced memory for negative stimuli in healthy and depressed individuals . We examined whether the effect of reboxetine on emotional memory in healthy individuals would be moderated by P18089 genotype . P18089 deletion carriers demonstrated enhanced emotional memory for negative stimuli compared with deletion noncarriers , consistent with prior studies . DB00234 attenuated enhanced memory for negative stimuli in deletion noncarriers but had no significant effect in deletion carriers . This is the first demonstration of genetic variation influencing antidepressant drug effects on emotional processing in healthy humans . Molecular components and functions of the endocannabinoid system in mouse prefrontal cortex . BACKGROUND : Cannabinoids have deleterious effects on prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) -mediated functions and multiple evidences link the endogenous cannabinoid ( endocannabinoid ) system , cannabis use and schizophrenia , a disease in which P27918 functions are altered . Nonetheless , the molecular composition and the physiological functions of the endocannabinoid system in the P27918 are unknown . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Here , using electron microscopy we found that key proteins involved in endocannabinoid signaling are expressed in layers v/vi of the mouse prelimbic area of the P27918 : presynaptic cannabinoid P21554 receptors ( CB1R ) faced postsynaptic P41594 while diacylglycerol lipase alpha ( Q9Y4D2 ) , the enzyme generating the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol ( 2-AG ) was expressed in the same dendritic processes as P41594 . Activation of presynaptic CB1R strongly inhibited evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents . Prolonged synaptic stimulation at 10Hz induced a profound long-term depression ( LTD ) of layers V/VI excitatory inputs . The endocannabinoid -LTD was presynaptically expressed and depended on the activation of postsynaptic P41594 , phospholipase C and a rise in postsynaptic Ca(2+) as predicted from the localization of the different components of the endocannabinoid system . Blocking the degradation of 2-AG ( with Q76M96 602 ) but not of anandamide ( with Q76M96 597 ) converted subthreshold tetanus to LTD-inducing ones . Moreover , inhibiting the synthesis of 2-AG with DB01083 , blocked endocannabinoid-mediated LTD . All together , our data show that 2-AG mediates LTD at these synapses . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : Our data show that the endocannabinoid -retrograde signaling plays a prominent role in long-term synaptic plasticity at the excitatory synapses of the P27918 . Alterations of endocannabinoid -mediated synaptic plasticity may participate to the etiology of P27918 -related pathologies . The deletion variant of α2b-adrenergic receptor is associated with decreased risk in Alzheimer 's disease and mild cognitive impairment . A common genetic polymorphism of the α2b-adrenergic receptor ( P18089 ) resulting in a deletion of three glutamic acids located on the third intracellular loop of the protein , has been associated with memory formation enhanced by emotional events . Additionally , there are several studies documenting the involvement of this polymorphism in other types of cognition , such as episodic memory . The aim of this study was to investigate the possible relationship of this genetic variance with a common memory affecting disease , Alzheimer 's disease . Our study was carried out in a total number of 311 Greek subjects , including 119 sporadic AD patients , 95 D6RGH6 cases and 97 controls . Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and the fragments containing the polymorphism were amplified by PCR analysis . A genotypic analysis of the P02649 polymorphism was also carried out . A significant difference in the frequency of the P18089 genetic variation among the three groups was observed . Specifically , the deletion variant is more prevalent in controls than in AD and D6RGH6 patients . Our data demonstrate for the first time an independent contribution of the P18089 genetic polymorphism to memory impairment and we further suggest a possible protective role of the deletion variant against the disease development . Atrial and brain natriuretic peptides : secretion during exercise in patients with essential hypertension and modulation by acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition . 1. This study examined whether brain and atrial natriuretic peptides ( DB04899 , P01160 ) are secreted together through the coronary sinus from the heart , and whether plasma concentrations of DB04899 and P01160 were affected by ergometric exercise in patients with essential hypertension . The effects of temocapril , a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor , on plasma concentrations of these peptides was also examined . 2 . The plasma concentrations of immunoreactive ( ir ) DB04899 and ir- P01160 in the coronary sinus in seven patients with ischaemic heart disease during cardiac catheterization were far greater than values with plasma obtained at the same time from the femoral artery . 3 . The plasma concentrations of ir- DB04899 and ir- P01160 increased with exercise and were correlated with each other . DB08836 reduced the blood pressure and slightly ( but significantly ) decreased the levels of both peptides at rest and during exercise . 4 . The results suggest that DB04899 and P01160 were secreted together through the coronary sinus from the heart . The secretion was increased by exercise and suppressed by acute P12821 inhibition . The increase in these peptides during exercise may reflect a compensatory mechanism against further elevation of blood pressure .
Elevated CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells correlate with prolonged survival in glioblastoma patients despite integrated immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and at the systemic level . We characterized GBM patients ' tumor and systemic immune contexture with aim to reveal the mechanisms of immunological escape , their impact on patient outcome , and identify targets for immunotherapy . Increased CD3(+) T-cell infiltration was associated with prolonged survival independent of age , P16455 promoter methylation and post-operative treatment that implies potential for immunotherapy for GBM . Several mechanisms of escape were identified : within the tumor microenvironment : induced CD8(+) P10747 (-)Foxp3(+) Tregs that may tolerize antigen presenting cells , elevated CD73 and P49961 ectonucleotidases that suppress T-cell function , and at the systemic level : elevated P22301 levels in serum , diminished helper T-cell counts , and upregulated inhibitory P16410 . T cell costimulation : a rational target in the therapeutic armamentarium for autoimmune diseases and transplantation . T cells are central mediators of adaptive immunity . As such , they are involved in both normal immune responses ( e.g. , rejection of a transplanted organ ) and abnormal ones ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis ) . T cells require both antigen-specific and costimulatory signals for their full activation . Advances in protein engineering and an increased understanding of the immune response have culminated in the evolution and creation of protein therapeutics that target specific costimulatory molecules . The selective costimulation modulator abatacept ( CTLA-4Ig ) binds to P33681 and P42081 , blocking interaction with P10747 , and is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis . DB06681 , currently enrolling phase III trials in renal transplantation , was rationally designed from abatacept to bind with more avidity to P42081 , providing the more potent immunosuppressive properties required for immunosuppression in transplantation . This review describes the relevant immunology and summarizes recent clinical findings on these two molecules . Although both inhibit the P10747 costimulatory pathway , they are tailored for specific disease states -- abatacept for autoimmune diseases and belatacept for transplantation . Five-year safety and efficacy of belatacept in renal transplantation . DB06681 is a first-in-class co-stimulation blocker in development for primary maintenance immunosuppression . A Phase II study comparing belatacept with cyclosporine ( DB00091 ) for prevention of acute rejection and protection of renal function in kidney transplant recipients demonstrated similar efficacy and significantly higher measured Q92565 at 1 year for belatacept , but the incidence of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder was higher . Here , we present the results for the extension of this trial , which aimed to assess long-term safety and efficacy of belatacept . Seventy-eight of 102 patients who were receiving belatacept and the 16 of 26 who were receiving DB00091 completed the long-term extension period . Q92565 remained stable in patients who were receiving belatacept for 5 years , and the incidences of death/graft loss or acute rejection were low . The frequencies of serious infections were 16 % for belatacept and 27 % for DB00091 , and neoplasms occurred in 12 % of each group . No patients who were treated with belatacept and one patient who was treated with DB00091 developed posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder during the follow-up period . Serious gastrointestinal disorders occurred more frequently with belatacept ( 12 % belatacept versus 8 % DB00091 ) , and serious cardiac disorders occurred more frequently with DB00091 ( 2 % belatacept versus 12 % DB00091 ) . Pharmacokinetic analyses showed consistent exposure to belatacept over time . P42081 receptor saturation was higher in patients who were receiving belatacept every 4 weeks ( 74 % ) compared with every 8 weeks ( 56 % ) . In conclusion , this study demonstrated high patient persistence with intravenous belatacept , stable renal function , predictable pharmacokinetics , and good safety with belatacept over 5 years .

[ Use of new non-nephrotoxic immunosuppressive drugs in kidney transplantation , especially after ischemia-reperfusion injury ] . Medium- and long-term renal graft survival depends on 4 main factors : the quality of the harvested graft , ischemia-reperfusion injury during harvesting and re-implantation , rejection , and the nephrotoxicity of certain drugs ( especially immunosuppressants ) used in this setting . The most nephrotoxic immunosuppressive drugs are the anticalcineurins ( cyclosporine A and tacrolimus ) , a class discovered in the late 1970s and currently representing a basic component of all immunosuppressive protocols for solid organ graft recipients . The renal tubular and vascular toxicity of anticalcineurins is due to their immunosuppressive mechanism : they block the calcineurin pathway and thereby prevent transmission of the first signal from the T cell receptor to the nucleus , which normally triggers cytokine synthesis , New non-nephrotoxic immunosuppressants are therefore needed , especially for grafts of poor quality or subject to severe ischemia-reperfusion injury . Attention is turning to " old " molecules such as anti-thymocyte globulins , but exciting new immunosuppressants are now appearing . DB00092 is a fusion protein that binds to the immunological synapse-associated molecule P06729 , which normally interacts with LFA-3 . DB06681 , another fusion protein , blocks the T cell second signal CD 28- P33681 .1/ P33681 .2 . Finally , new chemical agents are being developed , such as sautrasporine , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , and tofacitinib , a Jak inhibitor . Serological HLA class I alleles in Senegalese blood donors detected HBs Ag positive . We analysed the HLA class I alleles in 96 blood donors HBs Ag positive compared with 93 healthy control individuals ( HBs negative ) . The most frequent HLA-A , -B , -C alleles found were , A23 ( 33.6 % ) ; A2 ( 25 % ) ; A30 ( 25 % ) ; B8 ( 31.5 % ) ; P33681 ( 16.3 % ) ; B58 ( 11.9 % ) ; B35 ( 11.9 % ) ; B49 ( 11.9 % ) ; B53 ( 10.8 % ) ; Cw7 ( Q04695 % ) ; Cw3 ( 36.9 % ) ; Cw4 ( 36.9 % ) . Significant differences ( P < 0.001 ) were found between the blood donors and the controls for the following HLA alleles , A1 ; A23 ; B8 and Cw3 . The detection of HBe antigen was positive in 26/84 blood donors . It was observed a significant difference ( P < 0.01 ; odds ratios (OR)=6.25 ) between positive and negative HBe antigens blood donors for HLA-A1 allele . P29965 proinflammatory and profibrotic effects on proximal tubular epithelial cells : role of NF-kappaB and lyn . Chronic allograft nephropathy ( P35658 ) is the main cause of renal graft loss , but its pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear . Immune system activation has been suggested as a key event in the development of P35658 . P25942 is a co-stimulatory protein whose expression is upregulated in proximal tubular epithelial cells ( PTEC ) in acute rejection . This receptor interacts with P29965 , expressed by activated T cells . P29965 induces the production by PTEC of different proinflammatory cytokines , but very little is known of its profibrotic effects . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of P25942 / P29965 interaction on PTEC expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , a powerful profibrotic mediator , and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) , a proinflammatory cytokine , and to investigate the signaling pathways that lead to these effects . Soluble P29965 induced a time-dependent increase in both P05121 and P13500 gene expression and protein production in PTEC . P25942 cross-linking on PTEC caused P01375 -R-associated factors 2 and 6 membrane translocation . This event led to NF-kappaB activation , through the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase , and to a significant increase in the phosphorylation of lyn , a src-related tyrosine kinase . Lyn , upon phosphorylation , became strictly associated with caveolin-1 , a scaffolding protein enriched in caveolae . Lyn inhibition did not have any effect on P29965 -induced NF-kappaB activation and P13500 expression but abolished P05121 induction . On the contrary , NF-kappaB inhibition significantly reduced only P13500 expression . In conclusion , P29965 could play a key role in the pathogenesis of P35658 through P05121 induction . P29965 profibrotic and proinflammatory effects are mediated by different signaling pathways , suggesting that drugs that inhibit inflammation may not be equally effective in reducing fibrosis . Genetic variants in pre-eclampsia : a meta-analysis . BACKGROUND Pre-eclampsia has a clear familial component , suggesting that the condition may be partly attributable to genetic susceptibility . The search for susceptibility genes has led to a drastic increase in the number of published studies associating genetic factors with pre-eclampsia . However , attempts to replicate these findings have yielded inconsistent results . This meta-analysis assessed the pooled effect of each genetic variant that is reproducibly associated with pre-eclampsia . METHODS Studies that assessed the association between genes and pre-eclampsia were searched in PubMed , Embase and Web of Science . We selected all genetic variants that were significantly associated with pre-eclampsia in an initial study and were subsequently independently reproduced in at least one additional study . All studies that assessed these reproduced variants were then included . The association between genetic variants and pre-eclampsia was calculated at the allele level , and the main measure of effect was a pooled odds ratio in a random-effects model . RESULTS The literature search yielded 2965 articles , of which 542 investigated genetic associations in pre-eclampsia . We identified 22 replicated genetic variants , of which 7 remained significantly associated with pre-eclampsia following meta-analysis . These variants were in or near the following genes : P12821 , P16410 , F2 , FV , P06858 and P05121 . CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis identified seven genetic variants associated with pre-eclampsia . Importantly , many of these variants are also risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease , revealing that pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular disease have shared genetic risk factors . The contribution of the identified genetic variants in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia should be the focus of future studies . Therapeutic factor VIII does not trigger Q15399 .2 and O60603 .6 signalling in vitro . The administration of therapeutic factor VIII ( FVIII ) to patients with haemophilia A induces the development of inhibitory anti-FVIII IgG in a substantial number of patients . For an antigen-specific immune response to develop , antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) need to mature and procure appropriate co-stimulatory signals to T cells at the time of presentation of the endocytosed antigen . The nature of the danger signals that induce P25054 maturation , thus initiating the anti-FVIII immune response , are yet ill-characterized . Contradictory reports on a direct effect of therapeutic FVIII on P25054 maturation have been released . Here , we investigated whether FVIII directly triggers O60603 ( O60603 ) signalling . The capacity of human recombinant FVIII to promote the maturation of a mouse bone marrow macrophage cell line ( BMA ) was investigated by flow cytometry . In parallel , the triggering of Q15399 .2 or O60603 .6-expressing HEK293 cells by FVIII was analysed following transfection of the cells with a reporter construct for NFκB activity . In contrast , to zymosan , a known O60603 agonist , human recombinant FVIII did not induce the maturation of mouse BMA macrophages , as analysed by the levels of expression of P33681 , P42081 , P25942 and I-Ab at the cell surface . Furthermore , incubation of FVIII with cells expressing O60603 paired with Q15399 or Q9Y2C9 , failed to activate NFκB , whereas NKκB activity was triggered in the presence of zymosan . Our results confirm that FVIII alone is insufficient to trigger the maturation of APCs that is required to initiate an immune response . DB00278 -coupled Affi-Gel matrix for the purification of thrombin from plasma . Sometimes it is necessary to obtain thrombin from limited amounts of human plasma for laboratory assay . None of the available purification methods easily deals with this subject . The procedure described in the present paper uses a readily available pharmaceutical agent , argatroban , to construct an affinity matrix . DB00278 has a high affinity for thrombin and its thrombin binding is reversible . P00734 derived from a Ba(2+) precipitate of human plasma is used as the starting material . The crude prothrombin can be bulk activated to thrombin using taipan-snake ( Oxyuranus scutellatus ) venom and bound to the argatroban-coupled matrix without further processing steps . The thrombin product eluted from the argatroban matrix is very pure as judged by high specific activity and by electrophoresis . This purification scheme is rapid , yielding purified thrombin within 2 days . Review : molecular pathology in adult high-grade gliomas : from molecular diagnostics to target therapies . The classification of malignant gliomas is moving from a morphology-based guide to a system built on molecular criteria . The development of a genomic landscape for gliomas and a better understanding of its functional consequences have led to the development of internally consistent molecular classifiers . However , development of a biologically insightful classification to guide therapy is still a work in progress . Response to targeted treatments is based not only on the presence of drugable targets , but rather on the molecular circuitry of the cells . Further , tumours are heterogeneous and change and adapt in response to drugs . Therefore , the challenge of developing molecular classifiers that provide meaningful ways to stratify patients for therapy remains a major challenge for the field . In this review , we examine the potential role of P16455 methylation , O75874 /2 mutations , 1p/19q deletions , aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor and PI3K pathways , abnormal p53/Rb pathways , cancer stem-cell markers and microRNAs as prognostic and predictive molecular markers in the setting of adult high-grade gliomas and we outline the clinically relevant subtypes of glioblastoma with genomic , transcriptomic and proteomic integrated analyses . Furthermore , we describe how these advances , especially in epidermal growth factor receptor/PI3K/ P42345 signalling pathway , affect our approaches towards targeted therapy , raising new challenges and identifying new leads . Concise prediction models of anticancer efficacy of 8 drugs using expression data from 12 selected genes . We developed concise , accurate prediction models of the in vitro activity for 8 anticancer drugs ( DB00544 , DB00515 , DB00305 , DOX , CPT-11 , SN-38 , TXL and TXT ) , along with individual clinical responses to DB00544 using expression data of 12 genes . We first performed cDNA microarray analysis and MTT assay of 19 human cancer cell lines to sort out genes which were correlative in expression levels with cytotoxicities of the 8 drugs ; we selected 13 genes with proven functional significance to drug sensitivity from a huge number of potent prediction marker genes . The correlation significance of each was confirmed using expression data quantified by real-time RT-PCR , and finally 12 genes ( P08183 , Q9UNQ0 , P10632 , P08684 , Q12882 , P09211 , P16455 , P15559 , P16435 , P11388 , P07437 and P04818 ) were selected as more reliable predictors of drug response . Using multiple regression analysis , we fixed 8 prediction formulae which embraced the variable expressions of the 12 genes and arranged them in order , to predict the efficacy of the drugs by referring to the value of Akaike 's information criterion for each sample . These formulae appeared to accurately predict the in vitro efficacy of the drugs . For the first clinical application model , we fixed prediction formulae for individual clinical response to DB00544 in the same way using 41 clinical samples obtained from 30 gastric cancer patients and found to be of predictive value in terms of survival , time to treatment failure and tumor growth . None of the 12 selected genes alone could predict such clinical responses . DB06643 -- an emerging treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis . IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD : Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease that is associated with an imbalance in bone remodeling . DB06643 is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody to receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) , a cytokine member of the P01375 family that is the principal mediator of osteoclastic bone resorption . AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW : The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis is evaluated by reviewing the published literature and presentations at scientific meetings through 2009 . WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN : This review focuses on the data on fracture risk reduction and safety endpoints of denosumab in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis . TAKE HOME MESSAGE : In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis , denosumab ( 60 mg by subcutaneous injection every 6 months ) increased bone mineral density , reduced bone turnover markers , and reduced the risk of vertebral , hip and non-vertebral fractures . DB06643 was well tolerated with a safety profile generally similar to placebo . It is a promising emerging drug for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis . Mechanisms of ganglioside inhibition of P25054 function . Gangliosides shed by tumor cells exert potent inhibitory effects on cellular immune responses . Here we have studied ganglioside inhibition of P25054 function . When human monocytes were preincubated in 50 micro M highly purified ganglioside G(D1a) , pulsed with tetanus toxoid ( TT ) , and washed , the expected Ag-induced proliferative response of autologous normal T cells added to these monocytes was inhibited by 81 % . Strikingly , there was also almost complete ( 92 % ) and selective inhibition of the up-regulation of the monocyte costimulatory molecule P33681 , while I- P62158 -1 , LFA-3 , HLA-DR , and P42081 expression were unaffected . Purified LPS-stimulated monocytes that had been preincubated in G(D1a) likewise showed inhibition of P33681 up-regulation ( 59 % ) as well as down-regulation of P25942 ( 54 % ) and impaired release of IL-12 and P01375 ( reduced by 59 and 51 % ) . G(D1a)-preincubated human dendritic cells ( DC ) were also affected . They had reduced constitutive expression of P25942 ( 33 % ) and P33681 ( 61 % ) , but not P42081 , and marked inhibition of release of P05231 ( 72 % ) , IL-12 ( 70 % ) , and P01375 ( 46 % ) . Even when pulsed with TT , these ganglioside-preincubated DC remained deficient in costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine secretion and were unable to induce a normal T cell proliferative response to TT . Finally , significant inhibition of nuclear localization of NF-kappaB proteins in activated DC suggests that disruption of NF-kappaB activation may be one mechanism contributing to ganglioside interference with P25054 expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokine secretion , which , in turn , may diminish antitumor immune responses . Development of a chimeric anti- P25942 monoclonal antibody that synergizes with DB06681 to prolong islet allograft survival . In recent years , reagents have been developed that specifically target signals critical for effective T cell activation and function . Manipulation of the P10747 / P33681 /86 and P25942 /CD154 pathways has exhibited extraordinary efficacy , particularly when the pathways are blocked simultaneously . Despite the reported efficacy of anti-CD154 in rodents and higher models , its future clinical use is uncertain due to reported thromboembolic events in clinical trials . To circumvent this potential complication , we developed and evaluated a chimeric Ab targeting P25942 ( Chi220 , BMS-224819 ) as an alternative to CD154 . Although Chi220 blocks CD154 binding , it also possesses partial agonist properties and weak stimulatory potential . The anti- P25942 was tested alone and in combination with a rationally designed , high affinity variant of P16410 -Ig , DB06681 ( belatacept ) , in a nonhuman primate model of islet transplantation . Although either agent alone only modestly prolonged islet survival ( Chi220 alone : 14 , 16 , and 84 days ; DB06681 alone : 58 and 60 days ) , their combination ( DB06681 and Chi220 ) dramatically facilitated long term survival ( 237 , 237 , 220 , > 185 , and 172 days ) . We found that the effects of Chi220 treatment were not mediated solely through deletion of P11836 -bearing cells and that the combined therapy did not significantly impair established antiviral immunity . Bayesian analysis and the GUSTO trial . Global Utilization of DB00086 and Tissue P00747 Activator in Occluded Arteries . DB06643 for joints and bones . DB06643 is an investigational , fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity and specificity for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) , a cytokine member of the tumor necrosis factor family . O14788 , an essential mediator of osteoclast formation , function , and survival , plays a major role in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis , structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis , and bone loss associated with other skeletal disorders . DB06643 suppresses bone turnover by inhibiting the action of O14788 on osteoclasts . DB06643 reduces bone turnover and increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density , reduces fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis , and inhibits structural damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis when added to ongoing methotrexate treatment . It is generally well tolerated , with a good safety profile . Adverse and serious adverse events , including infections and malignancy , are similar in patients treated with denosumab or placebo . P00734 in normal human cerebrospinal fluid originates from the blood . In spite of the fact that prothrombin is produced by cells within the central nervous system , its presence in the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) has not been investigated . We determined the concentration of prothrombin in P04141 with reference to the concentration in plasma in paired samples from 18 " normal " control patients and 4 patients with relapsing-remitting type of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The newly developed ELISA was very specific ( no cross-reactivity with thrombin ) and sensitive ( detection limit -- 0.7 ng/ml ) with an imprecision of CV = 8.3 % ( intraseries ) and 7.0 % ( interassay ) . The mean prothrombin concentration in normal P04141 was 0.55 mg/l ( CV +/- 33 % , range : 0.28-0.93 mg/l ) , in normal plasma 121.8 mg/l +/- 21 % , resulting in a mean P04141 /plasma concentration quotient ( Q(Proth) -- 4.5 x 10(-3) ( CV +/- 35 % , range : 2.1-8.3 x 10(-3) ) corresponding to a mean albumin quotient in this group of subjects of Q(Alb) = 5.8 x 10(-3) . Due to the Q(Proth) and the molecular weight of prothrombin ( 72 kDa ) -- similar to that of albumin -- we conclude that prothrombin in normal human P04141 originates predominantly ( > 95 % ) from blood . The enzymatic activity in P04141 is conserved . Comparable results obtained in MS patients with only few small Q9BWK5 lesions suggest that local chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system does not influence prothrombin concentration in the P04141 if the blood- P04141 barrier function is normal . P00797 inhibition reduces atherosclerotic plaque neovessel formation and regresses advanced atherosclerotic plaques . OBJECTIVE : The interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) in the pathogenesis of advanced atherosclerotic plaques is not well understood . We studied the effects of the renin inhibitor aliskiren on the progression of advanced atherosclerotic plaque in apolipoprotein E-deficient ( ApoE(-/-) ) mice with a special focus on plaque neovessel formation . METHODS AND RESULTS : Four-wk-old ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet for 8 wks , and the mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups and administered a vehicle , hydralazine , or aliskiren for an additional 12 wks . DB09026 reduced the atherosclerotic plaque area and plaque neovessel density . It increased the plaque collagen and elastin contents , and reduced plasma angiotensin II levels and plaque macrophage infiltration and cathepsin S ( CatS ) protein . DB09026 also decreased the levels of AT1R , gp91phox , O60603 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and CatS mRNAs in the aortic roots . DB01275 had no beneficial vascular effects , although its administration resulted in the same degree of blood pressure reduction as aliskiren . CatS deficiency mimicked the aliskiren-mediated vasculoprotective effect in the ApoE(-/-) mice , but aliskiren showed no further benefits in ApoE(-/-) CatS(-/-) mice . In vitro , O60603 silencing reduced CatS expression induced by angiotensin II . Moreover , aliskiren or the inhibition of CatS impaired the endothelial cell angiogenic action in vitro or/and ex vivo . CONCLUSION : P00797 inhibition appears to inhibit advanced plaque neovessel formation in ApoE(-/-) mice and to decrease the vascular inflammatory action and extracellular matrix degradation , partly by reducing AT1R/ O60603 -mediated CatS activation and activity , thus regressing advanced atherosclerosis . P00797 angiotensin system modulates P42345 pathway through AT2R in HIVAN . P42345 ( P42345 ) has been reported to contribute to the development of HIV-associated nephropathy ( HIVAN ) . We hypothesized that HIV may be activating renal tissue P42345 pathway through renin angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) via Angiotensin Receptor Type II receptor ( AT2R ) . Renal tissues of Vpr transgenic and Tg26 ( HIVAN ) mice displayed enhanced phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K . DB09026 , a renin inhibitor attenuated phosphorylation of both P42345 and p70S6K in renal tissues of HIVAN mice . Interestingly , Angiotensin Receptor Type I ( AT1R ) blockade did not modulate renal tissue phosphorylation of P42345 in HIVAN mice ; on the other hand , AT2R blockade attenuated renal tissue phosphorylation of P42345 in HIVAN mice . In vitro studies , both renin and Ang II displayed enhanced mouse tubular cell ( P04629 ) phosphorylation of p70S6K in a dose dependent manner . HIV/ P04629 also displayed enhanced phosphorylation of both P42345 and p70S6K ; interestingly this effect of HIV was further enhanced by losartan ( an AT1R blocker ) . On the other hand , AT2R blockade attenuated HIV-induced tubular cell phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K , whereas , AT2R agonist enhanced phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K . These findings indicate that HIV stimulates P42345 pathway in HIVAN through the activation of renin angiotensin system via AT2R . P49771 promotes myeloid dendritic cell differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells : possible application for cancer immunotherapy . Current in vitro culture systems allow the generation of human dendritic progenitor cells ( CFU-DCs ) . The aim of this study was to assess the effect of P49771 ( FL ) on the proliferation of human peripheral blood-derived myeloid CFU-DCs and their differentiation into more committed precursor cells ( pDCs ) using in vitro culture systems . Immunomagnetically separated P28906 + cells were cultured in serum-free , as well as in serum-containing , liquid suspension cultures to investigate the expansion and/or proliferation/differentiation of CFU-DCs , pDCs , and more mature dendritic cells ( DCs ) . FACS-sorted P28906 +Flt3+/- cells were cultured in methylcellulose to assay hematopoietic progenitors , including CFU-DCs . In the clonal cell culture supplemented with granulocyte/macrophage ( GM ) colony-stimulating factor ( P04141 ) , interleukin-4 , and tumor necrosis factor alpha , the frequency of CFU-DCs was significantly higher in the P28906 +Flt3+ fraction than in the P28906 +Flt3- population , thus suggesting functional Flt3 expression on CFU-DCs . Serum-free suspension culture of P28906 + cells revealed the potent effect of FL on the expansion of CFU-DCs in synergy with GM- P04141 and thrombopoietin ( P07202 ) . In addition , FL strongly induced the maturation of CFU-DCs into functional CD1a+ pDCs in serum-containing liquid suspension culture . Moreover , these FL-generated pDCs showed remarkable potential to differentiate into mature DCs with surface Q01151 / P42081 expression , which induced a distinct allogeneic T-cell response . These results clearly demonstrate that FL supports not only the proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitor cells , but also the maturation process of committed precursor cells along with the DC-lineage differentiation . Therefore , it is possible to develop a more efficient DC-based cancer immunotherapy using this specific cytokine combination , GM- P04141 + P07202 +FL in vitro in the near future . Quantitative analysis predicts the relative therapeutic efficacy of different forms of DB01281 . Modulating the activities of costimulatory molecules controlling immune responses holds considerable promise for immunotherapy . DB01281 ( abatacept ) , a soluble version of the T cell-expressed membrane receptor P16410 , is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . Like natural P16410 molecules , DB01281 ligates P33681 -1 and P33681 -2 on antigen presenting cells , preventing P10747 -mediated costimulation of T cells . However , DB01281 can also prevent ligation of P16410 , potentially blocking vital inhibitory signals , thereby augmenting immunity . There have been no quantitative analyses of the likely effects of DB01281 on costimulatory interactions at the immunological synapse . We present a mathematical model , based on rigorous biophysical and expression data , for simulating the effects of abatacept and a mutated derivative , DB06681 , on the synaptic interactions of P10747 and P16410 . The simulations reveal an unexpectedly large window within which P10747 , but not P16410 , ligation is blocked by DB01281 , perhaps explaining the efficacy of abatacept at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 10mg/kg ) and its relative safety . However , the simulations suggest that the present dosing regimen is close to the maximum theoretically safe dose . The simulations also show that , within the therapeutic window , DB06681 enhances the interaction of P16410 with the more potent of its two native ligands , P33681 -1 . They also suggest that P16410 ligation by P33681 -1 could , in principle , be enhanced by further decreasing the off-rate of DB01281 for binding to P33681 -2 . Our findings therefore offer molecular explanations for why DB06681 might prove to be more effective than abatacept in a clinical setting , and suggest ways in which its therapeutic efficacy could be further optimised . T-cell phenotype in protocol renal biopsy from transplant recipients treated with belatacept-mediated co-stimulatory blockade . BACKGROUND : DB06681 is thought to disrupt the interaction between P33681 /86 and P10747 , thus preventing T-cell activation by blocking the co-stimulatory second signal . However , the consequences on the T-cell profile in human renal transplant cases have not been determined . METHODS : In this study , we analysed intra-graft levels of the mRNAs for Treg ( Q9BZS1 ) , cytotoxic CD8 T cells ( P10144 ) , Th1 ( INFγ , Tbet ) , Th2 ( P23771 ) and Th17 ( RORγt and Q16552 ) in protocol biopsies obtained 12 months after renal transplantation in recipients treated with DB06681 or calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) . RESULTS : Only the intra-graft abundance of Q9BZS1 mRNA was significantly lower ( P < 0.001 ) in the DB06681 group than the CNI group . Conclusions . These results are in agreement with in vitro data suggesting that P10747 is a major co-stimulatory signal of both Tregs development and peripheral homeostasis but contrast with clinical trials showing a better 1-year graft function and a lower incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy in patients receiving DB06681 than patients treated with CNI . They suggest that immune benefits induced by DB06681 are not mediated by Treg expansion and that Q9BZS1 is not by itself a prognostic marker of long-term graft function in a non-inflammatory context . These results have to be , however , considered as preliminary since the size of our study population is limited . Maturation of dendritic cells by recombinant human P29965 -trimer leads to a homogeneous cell population with enhanced surface marker expression and increased cytokine production . Dendritic cells ( DC ) have been shown to be potent inducers of specific cytotoxic T-cell responses both in vivo and in vitro . Furthermore , exposure to cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha or P25942 triggering changes DC phenotype and cytokine production and may enhance the T-cell activating capacity of the DC . We studied DC phenotype and cytokine production as well as the T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lympocyte ( CTL ) activation induced by DC generated in vitro . In addition , the effect of exposure to recombinant human P29965 -trimer ( huCD40LT ) on these parameters was investigated . Effective differentiation of monocytes derived from freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) was obtained with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) and interleukin ( IL ) -4 . The DC expression of human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) molecules , P33681 , Q01151 , and P42081 was markedly enhanced by exposure to huCD40LT even compared to P01375 exposure . Only a moderate cytokine production was observed initially , while P01375 addition or P25942 triggering , especially , induced enhanced production of P05231 and IL-12 p40 . Surprisingly , comparable induction of T-cell proliferation by a DC allostimulus or through the presentation of PPD , and influenza M1-peptide specific CTL activity was obtained with nonmaturated ( Q01151 - ) and maturated ( Q01151 + ) DC . In conclusion , a final maturation of monocyte-derived DC through huCD40LT resulted in a highly homogeneous cell population with enhanced surface marker expression and high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines . In addition , the induction of responses to allo or recall antigens presented by huCD40LT maturated DC was comparable to the responses obtained with the DC maturated through P01375 exposure . [ Measurement of rifampicin and clarithromycin in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection ] . DB01045 ( RFP ) induces hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes , making drug interactions a very important clinical problem . DB01211 ( P62158 ) metabolism is reportedly enhanced by induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes ( P08684 ) by RFP , so that the blood lend of P62158 decreases when RFP is administered concurrently . We connected an electrochemical detector to a high-performance liquid chromatograph ( HPLC ) for simple , rapid , easy measurement of blood concentrations of RFP and P62158 . Using samples of patient serum , normal serum , and reference standards , we compared HPLC by an external laboratory and the results of LC/MS/MS analysis with those of this new assay . A strong correlation was seen between our HPLC results and those of the external laboratory in RFP levels ( r=0.975 , p < 0.01 ) . A strong correlation was also seen between results we obtained for P62158 with the electrochemical detector in this assay and values measured by LC/MS/MS analysis ( r=0.995 , p < 0.01 ) . Our method enabled simple , rapid measurement of RFP and P62158 by connecting the HPLC and electrochemical detector in tandem . This system was used to modulate dosage during combined therapy with RFP and P62158 . The therapeutic effect for nontuberculous mycobacteriosis is expected to improve , and our HPLC is expected to be useful for simple , rapid , easy measurement of blood concentrations . NSA9 , a human prothrombin kringle-2-derived peptide , acts as an inhibitor of kringle-2-induced activation in EOC2 microglia . In neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's , microglial cell activation is thought to contribute to CNS injury by producing neurotoxic compounds . P00734 and kringle-2 increase levels of NO and the mRNA expression of P35228 , IL-1beta , and P01375 in microglial cells . In contrast , the human prothrombin kringle-2 derived peptide NSA9 inhibits NO release and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta , P01375 , and P05231 in LPS-activated EOC2 microglia . In this study , we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of NSA9 in human prothrombin- and kringle-2-stimulated EOC2 microglia . Treatment with 20-100 muM of NSA9 attenuated both prothrombin- and kringle-2-induced microglial activation . NO production induced by MAPKs and NF-kappaB was similarly reduced by inhibitors of P29323 ( PD98059 ) , p38 ( SB203580 ) , NF-kappaB ( DB06151 ) , and NSA9 . These results suggest that NSA9 acts independently as an inhibitor of microglial activation and that its effects in EOC2 microglia are not influenced by the presence of kringle-2 . Plasmin-induced proteolysis of tenascin-C : modulation by T lymphocyte-derived urokinase-type plasminogen activator and effect on T lymphocyte adhesion , activation , and cell clustering . Proteolysis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix occur physiologically in processes such as tissue morphogenesis and repair and may participate in the regulation of complex cell functions , including proliferation and differentiation . While matrix degradation appears to be relevant to T lymphocyte migration through tissues , little is known about whether degraded matrix affects T lymphocyte function . We have studied the interaction between T lymphocytes and tenascin-C ( TN-C ) , a matrix protein we have previously reported to inhibit T lymphocyte activation , in the context of plasmin-induced degradation . Here we report that plasmin efficiently cleaves TN-C . Peripheral blood T lymphocytes stimulated with phorbol ester , anti- P10747 , or anti-CD3 Ab , induce , within 24 to 48 h , a strong plasminogen-dependent proteolysis of TN-C . We demonstrate that stimulated T lymphocytes activate plasminogen by secreting the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( u-PA ) . P00747 activation by T lymphocyte-derived u-PA occurs efficiently in fluid phase in the absence of cells . We investigate the consequences of plasmin-induced proteolysis on three of the effects of TN-C in relation to lymphocyte functions . Plasmin proteolysis converts TN-C from a nonadhesive into an adhesive substrate for T lymphocytes and abolishes its aggregating activity on PBMC . In contrast , the inhibitory effect of TN-C on T lymphocyte activation remains unaffected . These observations demonstrate that stimulated T lymphocytes induce plasminogen-dependent proteolysis of TN-C by secreting u-PA and suggest that proteolysis of TN-C may represent a mechanism by which to regulate some of its effects on T lymphocyte functions . DB00203 inhibits calcineurin/ Q13469 -mediated cyclin A expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells . AIMS : To examine whether calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway leads to proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( PASMCs ) by regulating cell cycle proteins and whether the phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) inhibitor sildenafil affects calcineurin/NFAT-induced cell proliferation . MAIN METHODS : A [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay was used to examine DNA synthesis ( cell proliferation ) ; cyclin A and Q13469 expressions were determined by Western blot . P24941 ( P24941 ) activity was measured with an in vitro kinase activity assay , and calcineurin and NFAT activity were evaluated using a calcineurin assay kit and a luciferase activity assay , respectively . A chemical inhibitor or siRNA transfection was used to inhibit calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway . KEY FINDINGS : Serotonin dose-dependently stimulated cyclin A expression in PASMCs . This effect was accompanied by dose-dependent increases in P24941 activity and the rate of DNA synthesis . At the same time , PASMCs treated with serotonin showed dose-dependent activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway . Inhibition of calcineurin activity by cyclosporine A or loss of Q13469 protein by siRNA transfection abolished serotonin-induced cyclin A expression and consequent P24941 activation and DNA synthesis . We further found that pretreatment of cells with sildenafil suppressed serotonin-triggered activation of calcineurin/ Q13469 signaling pathway and resultant cyclin A expression , P24941 activation and cell proliferation , while the presence of DT-3 [ a specific protein kinase G ( PKG ) peptide inhibitor ] reversed the effects of sildenafil on PASMCs . SIGNIFICANCE : Our study suggests that enhanced PKG activity suppresses calcineurin/ Q13469 cascade-mediated cyclin A expression , P24941 activation and PASMC proliferation to contribute to the overall effects of sildenafil in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension . Synergistic proliferative action of insulin-like growth factor I and 17 beta-estradiol in MCF-7S breast tumor cells . We have analyzed the mechanism by which the combination of insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) and 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) induces cell cycle progression in MCF-7S cells . This cell line differs from many other breast cancer-derived cell lines in that E2 ( 1 nM ) does not induce cell cycle progression , whereas the combination of submitogenic concentrations of P05019 ( 2 ng/ml ) and E2 does . We find that addition of P05019 to MCF-7S cells leads to a dose-dependent activation of the IGF type I receptor and of the Q96HU1 kinase and P19957 -kinase signaling pathways . No synergy of P05019 and E2 was detected in the activation of these signaling cascades . In terms of cell cycle-related molecules , we find that P05019 dose-dependently raises cyclin D1 levels in serum-starved cells . Subsequent activation of cyclin E/ P24941 , hyperphosphorylation of P06400 , and DNA synthesis are only induced by mitogenic concentrations of P05019 ( > or =20 ng/ml ) . Treatment of the cells with E2 also results in the induction of cyclin D1 , but in the absence of P05019 the cells remain arrested in P55008 phase . We conclude that in MCF-7S cells , the synergistic action of E2 and P05019 derives from the ability of both hormones to induce cyclin D1 expression . The action of P05019 is required in these cells to induce activity of the cyclin D1/ P11802 complex , which triggers progression through the cell cycle . Mesenchymal stem cells control alloreactive CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells . P10747 / P33681 co-stimulation blockade with belatacept prevents alloreactivity in kidney transplant patients . However , cells lacking P10747 are not susceptible to belatacept treatment . As CD8(+) P10747 (-) T-cells have cytotoxic and pathogenic properties , we investigated whether DB05914 ( O60682 ) are effective in controlling these cells . In mixed lymphocyte reactions ( P08235 ) , O60682 and belatacept inhibited peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . O60682 at O60682 /effector cell ratios of 1:160 and 1:2·5 reduced proliferation by 38·8 and 92·2 % , respectively . DB06681 concentrations of 0·1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml suppressed proliferation by 20·7 and 80·6 % , respectively . Both treatments in combination did not inhibit each other 's function . Allostimulated CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells were able to proliferate and expressed the cytolytic and cytotoxic effector molecules granzyme B , interferon ( IFN ) -γ and tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α . While belatacept did not affect the proliferation of CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells , O60682 reduced the percentage of P10747 (-) T cells in the proliferating CD8(+) T cell fraction by 45·9 % ( P = 0·009 ) . CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells as effector cells in P08235 in the presence of P01730 (+) T cell help gained P10747 expression , an effect independent of O60682 . In contrast , allostimulated P10747 (+) T cells did not lose P10747 expression in P08235 - O60682 co-culture , suggesting that O60682 control pre-existing P10747 (-) T cells and not newly induced P10747 (-) T cells . In conclusion , alloreactive CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells that remain unaffected by belatacept treatment are inhibited by O60682 . This study indicates the potential of an O60682 -belatacept combination therapy to control alloreactivity . Assessment of belatacept-mediated costimulation blockade through evaluation of P33681 /86-receptor saturation . BACKGROUND : The selective inhibitor of T-cell costimulation , belatacept , blocks P10747 -mediated T-cell activation by binding P33681 and P42081 on antigen-presenting cells . Understanding the extent to which belatacept binds to its targets in patients may enable correlation of belatacept exposure to receptor saturation as a pharmacodynamic measure of costimulation blockade . METHODS : Flow cytometry-based receptor competition assays were developed to monitor concentration-dependent occupancy of P33681 and P42081 receptors in whole blood and dendritic cell cultures in vitro . Receptor occupancy was correlated with inhibition of mixed leukocyte reactions and clinical validation was obtained by comparing receptor saturation in whole blood from healthy volunteers and in de novo renal transplant recipients participating in studies comparing cyclosporine and belatacept-based immunosuppression . RESULTS : DB06681 saturated P33681 and P42081 receptors in whole blood and dendritic cell cultures , although the belatacept concentrations required for P42081 -receptor saturation were approximately 10-fold higher than those required for P33681 saturation ( IC50=0.102 microg/mL vs. 0.009 microg/mL ) . Primary alloresponses were inhibited at the belatacept concentration required for P42081 -receptor saturation , but not at the lower concentration needed to saturate P33681 . Whole blood from belatacept-treated patients had significantly lower levels of free P42081 receptors versus pretransplant levels , healthy volunteers , or cyclosporine-treated patients . P42081 -receptor saturation correlated with belatacept dose/dose frequency and remained consistently more than 80 % . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that belatacept-mediated inhibition of alloresponses involved in transplant rejection correlates with P42081 saturation , indicating that P42081 -receptor occupancy may be a valid pharmacodynamic measure of costimulation blockade and provide the first direct clinical evidence that belatacept binds to one of its targets . Upregulation of cell-surface-associated plasminogen activation in cultured keratinocytes by interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha . Keratinocytes synthesize and secrete urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) which is bound in an autocrine manner to a specific receptor ( uPA-R ) at the keratinocyte surface . P00747 that is also bound to specific membrane binding sites is readily activated by uPA-R-bound uPA . Thus , plasmin is provided for proteolysis of pericellular glycoproteins . The expression of uPA and the uPA-R is confined to migrating keratinocytes during epidermal wound healing , rather than to keratinocytes of the normal epidermis . The regulatory factors of uPA/uPA-R expression in keratinocytes remained largely elusive . Proinflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) or interleukin-1 beta ( P01584 ) , are present in epidermal wounds . We have therefore tested P01584 and P01375 for their influence on surface-associated plasminogen activation in a human keratinocyte cell line ( HaCaT ) as well as in primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes . Both cytokines induced the secretion of uPA into the culture supernatants and a concomitant increase in uPA activity as well as in uPA and uPA-R antigen at the cell surface . The increase was preceded by an increase in specific mRNA . The induction was accompanied by an accelerated uPA-dependent and plasmin-mediated detachment of HaCaT cells from the culture substratum . Taken together , the proinflammatory cytokines P01584 and P01375 induced a coordinated increase in uPA and uPA-R as well as increased pericellular plasmin-mediated proteolysis in human epidermal keratinocytes . This function might be an element of the molecular cell biological events during epidermal wound healing . Interactions of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and P01375 receptor family members in the mouse and human . Ligands of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily ( TNFSF ) ( P41273 , APRIL , Q9Y275 , P32970 , P32971 , P29965 , EDA1 , Q92838 , P48023 , Q9UNG2 , O43557 , lymphotoxin alpha , lymphotoxin alphabeta , P23510 , O14788 , TL1A , P01375 , O43508 , and P50591 ) bind members of the P01375 receptor superfamily ( TNFRSF ) . A comprehensive survey of ligand-receptor interactions was performed using a flow cytometry-based assay . All ligands engaged between one and five receptors , whereas most receptors only bound one to three ligands . The receptors O75509 , Q969Z4 , Q9NS68 , P08138 , and mouse TNFRH3 did not interact with any of the known TNFSF ligands , suggesting that they either bind other types of ligands , function in a ligand-independent manner , or bind ligands that remain to be identified . The study revealed that ligand-receptor pairs are either cross-reactive between human and mouse ( e.g. Tweak/Fn14 , Q9Y6Q6 / O14788 ) , strictly species-specific ( Q9Y5U5 / Q9UNG2 ) , or partially species-specific ( e.g. OX40/ P23510 , P25942 / P29965 ) . Interestingly , the receptor binding patterns of lymphotoxin alpha and alphabeta are redundant in the human but not in the mouse system . Ligand oligomerization allowed detection of weak interactions , such as that of human P01375 with mouse P20333 . In addition , mouse APRIL exists as two different splice variants differing by a single amino acid . Although human APRIL does not interact with Q96RJ3 , the shorter variant of mouse APRIL exhibits weak but detectable binding to mouse Q96RJ3 . High LET (56)Fe ion irradiation induces tissue-specific changes in DNA methylation in the mouse . DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that drives phenotype and that can be altered by environmental exposures including radiation . The majority of human radiation exposures occur in a relatively low dose range ; however , the biological response to low dose radiation is poorly understood . Based on previous observations , we hypothesized that in vivo changes in DNA methylation would be observed in mice following exposure to doses of high linear energy transfer ( LET ) ( 56 ) Fe ion radiation between 10 and 100 cGy . We evaluated the DNA methylation status of genes for which expression can be regulated by methylation and that play significant roles in radiation responses or carcinogenic processes including apoptosis , metastasis , cell cycle regulation , and DNA repair ( P53355 , Q9UI08 , 14.3.3 , p16 , P16455 , and P17936 ) . We also evaluated DNA methylation of repeat elements in the genome that are typically highly methylated . No changes in liver DNA methylation were observed . Although no change in DNA methylation was observed for the repeat elements in the lungs of these same mice , significant changes were observed for the genes of interest as a direct effect and a delayed effect of irradiation 1 , 7 , 30 , and 120 days post exposure . At delayed times , differences in methylation profiles among genes were observed . DNA methylation profiles also significantly differed based on dose , with the lowest dose frequently affecting the largest change . The results of this study are the first to demonstrate in vivo high LET radiation-induced changes in DNA methylation that are tissue and locus specific , and dose and time dependent . Dopamine agonist-induced hypothermia and disruption of prepulse inhibition : evidence for a role of D3 receptors ? The dopamine D3/D2 receptor agonists 7-OH-DPAT , quinpirole , quinelorane , and PD128907 , the mixed dopamine agonist apomorphine , the D2 agonist bromocriptine , and the D1/D5 agonist SKF38393 were examined in models of hypothermia and prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in Wistar rats . As dopamine agonist-induced hypothermia has been proposed as a model of D3 receptor function , and dopamine agonists are known to disrupt PPI , drug potencies to induce hypothermia were established and compared with doses necessary to disrupt PPI . 7-OH-DPAT , quinpirole , quinelorane , PD128907 , and apomorphine , reduced body temperature and disrupted PPI with a similar rank order of potency ( quinelorane > quinpirole = 7-OH-DPAT > PD128907 = apomorphine ) . DB01200 and SKF38393 were ineffective in both models . In a separate study , the dopamine reuptake inhibitors cocaine and GBR 12909 had no effect on PPI . In a final set of studies , the D2/D3 antagonist raclopride blocked both 7-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia and 7-OH-DPAT-induced PPI disruption . The P08908 antagonist WAY 100,135 , and the peripheral D2-like antagonist domperidone had no effect . These findings suggest that the hypothermia and PPI disruptions seen with some of these dopamine agonists may be mediated by central D3 receptors ; however , only studies using more selective dopamine receptor ligands can definitively rule out effects at the D2 or D4 receptors . P08908 receptor activation : short-term effects on the mRNA expression of the P08908 receptor and galanin in the raphe nuclei . Systemic administration of the P08908 receptor agonist 8-OH-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ; 0.3 mg/kg , s.c. ) was used to explore the effects of activation of P08908 receptors on expression of mRNA coding for P08908 receptor , tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) and galanin in the ascending raphe nuclei . 8-OH-DPAT increased the hybridization signal of the P08908 receptor by 105 % in the dorsal raphe nucleus ( P33681 ) 30 min after the injection . No effects were seen at the later time points ( 2-8 h ) . In the median raphe nucleus ( B8 ) and the B9 cell group in the medial lemniscus , 8-OH-DPAT induced a marked decrease in labeling 30 min after injection . At 8 h following 8-OH-DPAT injection , the effect had shifted to an increase in P08908 receptor labeling by 68 % in the B8 area . Importantly 8-OH-DPAT had no significant effects on the expression of mRNA coding for P17752 and galanin . The results suggest an important and differential mechanism for the regulation of P08908 receptor mRNA levels in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei . This regulation may be of importance for the differential control of the activity of the ascending 5-HT neurons , and hence for mood regulation . The results also indicate a dissociation between the effects mediated by P08908 receptor functions and those regulating the coexisting peptide galanin in the dorsal raphe . Production and characterization of DB06681 , a variant of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin , in Pichia pastoris . Blocking the P10747 / P33681 costimulatory pathway is a promising strategy in the treatment of graft rejection , graft-versus-host disease and autoimmune diseases . DB06681 , a high-affinity variant of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin ( DB01281 ) , is a more potent inhibitor of the interaction between P10747 and P33681 than is DB01281 . In a previous study , DB06681 was produced in a mammalian cell system , which is time-consuming and expensive . To obtain DB06681 more efficiently and cost effectively , we attempted to produce DB06681 using a Pichia pastoris expression system . The gene encoding DB06681 , with an additional 6- DB00117 tag at the N-terminus , was cloned into the yeast vector pPIC9K and expressed in the P. pastoris strain GS115 . Under the optimized induction conditions for protein expression ( inoculum density , OD(600) = 80 ; methanol concentration added daily , 1.0-3.0 % ; induction time point , 72-96 h ; culture medium pH = 6.0 ) , the yield of purified DB06681 was approximately 30 mg l(-1) by one-step Ni-agarose affinity chromatography . Q96IV0 F treatment showed the purified DB06681 to be post-translational modified by N-linked glycosylation . In biological function assays , DB06681 expressed in P. pastoris demonstrated specific binding to P33681 -1/ P33681 -2-positive Raji cells and also suppressed lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . These results suggest that DB06681 produced in P. pastoris is biologically active and will be useful for experimental therapy on immunotherapy for transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases . What 's in the pipeline ? New immunosuppressive drugs in transplantation . In the pipeline , there are a number of novel immunosuppressive drugs in preclinical development or in early clinical trials . The major target of new agents are cell-surface molecules important in immune cell interactions ( especially the costimulatory pathway ) , signaling pathways that activate T cells , T-cell proliferation and trafficking and recruitment of immune cells responsible for rejection . The most promising biologic agents include a humanized anti-CD11a ( anti-LFA1 ) , humanized anti- P33681 .1/ P33681 .2 , a second-generation DB01281 ( DB06681 ) and a humanized antibody to anti- P08575 RB . Inhibitors of T-cell activation and signaling are still in preclinical development . The most interesting inhibitors of T-cell proliferation include inhibitors of the Janus protein tyrosine kinase , P52333 , and FK778 , a leflunomide analog . Chemokines play an important role in rejection by virtue of their critical role as regulator of trafficking and activation of lymphocytes . Early trials of FTY720 , a synthetic small molecule with functional homology to sphingosine-1 phosphate leading to lymphocyte sequestration , appear very promising ; however , enthusiasm for this drug is mitigated by its potential cardiac side-effects . Antagonists to several chemokine receptors , including P32246 , P49682 and P51681 , have been shown to be effective in experimental transplantation and are likely to be considered for clinical development . Suppression of IL-12 production by soluble P29965 : evidence for involvement of the Q8TCB0 /42 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway . IL-12 is a key cytokine in skewing immune responses toward Th1-like reactions . Human monocytes/macrophages produce high amounts of bioactive IL-12 when a priming signal ( P01579 or GM- P04141 ) precedes a second signal ( e.g. , LPS ) . We and others have previously shown that preincubation with LPS before this stimulation procedure can efficiently and selectively suppress the production of IL-12 by human monocytes . In this study , we show that an almost complete suppression of IL-12 production can also be observed after preincubation of monocytes with costimulatory cell surface molecules that bind to members of the TNFR superfamily ( P29965 , O14788 ( O14788 ) ) . The suppression of IL-12 was observable on the mRNA and protein levels and was not due to endogenous production of known IL-12 antagonists ( i.e. , P22301 , P05112 , and PGE(2) ) , to an increased number of cells undergoing apoptosis , nor to down-regulation of the P01579 or P25942 receptor . Cell surface expression of the costimulatory molecules P33681 and P42081 was not reduced by the preincubation procedure , and only a moderate reduction of P05231 production was observed . Several studies have identified signal transduction pathways that are activated by P25942 signaling , including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases . The presence of the extracellular signal-related kinase-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-specific inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 abrogated suppression induced by sCD40 ligand or other second signals . This indicates that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 contributes to the underlying mechanism of IL-12 suppression . This mechanism may be relevant in other inflammatory responses and may help to develop therapeutic strategies in Th1-mediated diseases . Aging impairs induction of cyclin-dependent kinases and down-regulation of p27 in mouse P01730 (+) cells . To define the link between the early activation defects and the impaired proliferation response of cells from old mice , we characterized the influence of age on expression and activity of proteins that participate in cell-cycle regulation . We found that aging led to significant declines in the ability of mouse P01730 (+) T cells to respond to CD3 and P10747 stimuli by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinases P24941 , P11802 , and Q00534 , whether the defect was assessed by protein level or functional activity . Induction of P24941 activity was also impaired in cells from old mice that were activated with PMA plus ionomycin , stimuli that bypass the TCR/CD3 complex , or by CD3/ P10747 in the presence of P60568 , indicating that the age-related changes lie , at least in part , downstream of the enzymes activated by these stimuli . We also noted an impairment in the ability of P01730 (+) cells from old mice to down-regulate the CDK inhibitor p27 after activation , but we found no change in induction of P38936 , an inhibitor of CDK that may also play other roles in cell-cycle control . Altered CDK activation is likely to mediate the age-related decline in T cell proliferation to polyclonal stimulation . Agonism at P41595 receptors is not a class effect of the ergolines . Restrictive cardiac valvulopathies observed in Parkinson patients treated with the ergoline dopamine agonist pergolide have recently been associated with the agonist efficacy of the drug at 5-hydroxytryptamine2B ( P41595 ) receptors . To evaluate whether agonism at P41595 receptors is a phenomenon of the class of the ergolines , we studied P41595 receptor-mediated relaxation in porcine pulmonary arteries to five ergolines which are used as antiparkinsonian drugs . DB01186 and cabergoline were potent full agonists in this tissue ( pEC50 8.42 and 8.72 ) . DB01200 acted as a partial agonist ( pEC50 6.86 ) . Lisuride and terguride , however , failed to relax the arteries but potently antagonized 5-HT-induced relaxation ( pKB 10.32 and 8.49 ) . Thus , agonism at P41595 receptors seems not to be a class effect of the ergolines . DB06681 : a new era of immunosuppression ? Q8N1N2 T-cell activation in alloimmunity requires the engagement of several costimulatory molecules . P16410 -Ig and its commercially available fusion proteins , belatacept and abatacept , are used to block P33681 /86 and promote T-cell tolerance . DB06681 , a higher binding affinity molecule , is currently approved for clinical use in renal transplantation . The results of two Phase III clinical trials showed a similar patient/graft survival , with better renal function at a 3-year follow-up compared with conventional immunosuppression . There was a higher risk of early rejection and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder , especially with EBV-negative patients receiving kidneys from EBV-positive donors . DB06681 -treated groups had a better cardiovascular and metabolic profile . The authors review both preclinical and human studies of P16410 -Igs . Chronic induction . What 's new in the pipeline . Induction therapy with biological agents was introduced the in the 1970s and the rationale , concepts and approach have remained almost unchanged for 30 years . However , the novel biological agents being developed for induction therapy are being designed for chronic rather than short-term therapy with several objectives : reduce dependence on toxic and nephrotoxic agents , improve outcome and ultimately facilitate the emergence of tolerance . The biological agents include efalizumab , a humanized anti-CD11a ( anti-LFA1 ) , anti- CD154 , anti- P25942 , a number of agents targeting P40933 and its receptor , and costimulation blockade with humanized antibodies to P33681 / P42081 and the fusion receptor protein DB06681 , a second generation DB01281 . The past decade has witnessed an unprecedented number of small molecules/oral drugs that have been developed and approved for renal transplantation ; the next decade , however , may witness the emergence of a new class of biological induction agents that may displace some of the currently used drugs . Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor up-regulates P32246 in human neutrophils . Neutrophils ( polymorphonuclear leukocytes ; PMN ) are phagocytic cells instrumental in the clearance of infectious pathogens . Human PMN are commonly thought to respond primarily to chemokines from the CXC family . However , recent findings suggest that under specific cytokine activation conditions , PMN can also respond to some CC chemokines . In this study , the effect of GM- P04141 , a well-characterized PMN priming and maturation factor , on CC-chemokine receptor ( CCR ) expression in PMN was investigated . Constitutive expression of P32246 and P51677 mRNA in PMN was detected by ribonuclease protection assay . Following incubation of PMN with GM- P04141 ( 0.01-10 ng/ml ; 6 h ) P32246 mRNA expression was rapidly ( approximately 1 h ) up-regulated . In contrast , no significant induction of P41597 , P51677 , CCR4 , or P51681 mRNA was observed . P32246 protein was also up-regulated by GM- P04141 stimulation . GM- P04141 -induced up-regulation of P32246 showed functional consequences because GM- P04141 -treated PMN , but not control cells , responded to the CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha , monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 , and RANTES in assays of chemotactic migration and intracellular calcium mobilization . These results suggest that PMN activated by the proinflammatory cytokine GM- P04141 can change their receptor expression pattern and become responsive to CC chemokines . Reactive oxygen species-dependent P01375 converting enzyme activation through stimulation of P41595 and alpha1D autoreceptors in neuronal cells . A major determinant of neuronal homeostasis is the proper integration of cell signaling pathways recruited by a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal factors . By taking advantage of a neuroectodermal cell line ( 1C11 ) endowed with the capacity to differentiate into serotonergic ( 1C115-HT ) or noradrenergic ( 1C11NE ) neurons , we identified serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) - and norepinephrine ( NE ) -dependent signaling cascades possibly involved in neuronal functions . First , we establish that P41595 receptors and 1D adrenoceptors are functionally coupled to reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) synthesis through NADPH oxidase activation in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells . This observation constitutes the prime evidence that bioaminergic autoreceptors take part in the control of the cellular redox equilibrium in a neuronal context . Second , our data identify P78536 ( P01375 - Converting Enzyme ) , a member of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase ( ADAM ) family , as a downstream target of the P41595 and 1D receptor-NADPH oxidase signaling pathways . Upon P41595 or 1D receptor stimulation , ROS fully govern P01375 - shedding in the surrounding milieu of 1C115-HT or 1C11NE cells . Third , P41595 and 1Dreceptor couplings to the NADPH oxidase- P78536 cascade are strictly restricted to 1C11-derived progenies that have implemented a complete serotonergic or noradrenergic phenotype . Overall , these observations suggest that P41595 and 1D autoreceptors may play a role in the maintenance of neuron- and neurotransmitter-associated functions . Eventually , our study may have implications regarding the origin of oxidative stress as well as up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in neurodegenerative disorders , which may relate to the deviation of normal signaling pathways . Rational development of DB06681 ( belatacept ) , a high-affinity variant of P16410 -Ig with potent immunosuppressive properties . Current success in organ transplantation is dependent upon the use of calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimens . Unfortunately , current immunotherapy targets molecules with ubiquitous expression resulting in devastating non-immune side effects . T-cell costimulation has been identified as a new potential immunosuppressive target . The best characterized pathway includes P10747 , its homologue P16410 and their ligands P33681 and P42081 . While an immunoglobulin fusion protein construct of P16410 suppressed rejection in rodents , it lacked efficacy in primate transplant models . In an attempt to increase the biologic potency of the parent molecule a novel , modified version of P16410 -Ig , DB06681 ( belatacept ) , was constructed . Two amino acid substitutions ( L104E and A29Y ) gave rise to slower dissociation rates for both P42081 and P33681 . The increased avidity resulted in a 10-fold increase in potency in vitro and significant prolongation of renal allograft survival in a pre-clinical primate model . The use of immunoselective biologics may provide effective maintenance immunosuppression while avoiding the collateral toxicities associated with conventional immunsuppressants . Advances in immunosuppression for kidney transplantation : new strategies for preserving kidney function and reducing cardiovascular risk . The development of new immunosuppressants for renal transplantation is aimed not only at improving & nbsp;short-term outcomes , but also at achieving better safety , cardiovascular , and metabolic profiles and at decreasing & nbsp;nephrotoxicity . DB06681 is a fusion protein that inhibits T cell activation by binding to P33681 and P42081 antigens . Clinical trials , particularly the BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT studies , have shown that belatacept preserves function and structure in renal grafts . The effects of belatacept provide long-term , sustained results , and the safety and efficacy of this drug have been demonstrated in cases of renal transplantation from expanded criteria donors . Compared to calcineurin inhibitors , belatacept is associated with a lower incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy and a more favourable cardiovascular and metabolic profile . Novel immunosuppression : small molecules and biologics . Kidney transplantation today has excellent short-term outcomes that have paralleled the use of new immunosuppressive agents introduced in the 1990s . In addition to reducing acute rejection , the goals for developing new agents is to improve long-term outcome , minimize nephrotoxicity , and reduce infectious , cardiovascular , and malignancy-related complications . Novel small molecules and biological agents currently in clinical development may help to minimize the use of calcineurin inhibitors and steroids . These small molecules include FTY720 , a sphingosine phosphate-receptor modulator , FK778 , an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis , CP-690550 , a P52333 inhibitor , and AEB-071 , a protein kinase C inhibitor . The biological agents include drugs targeting interleukin-15 , anti- P25942 , belatacept ( DB06681 ) , a second-generation CTLY4Ig that blocks the interaction between P33681 /86 and P10747 costimulatory pathways , and efalizumab , a humanized anti-LFA1 monoclonal antibody . These new agents currently in preclinical and clinical trials appear promising and may represent the emergence of novel immunosuppressive agents that can deliver immunosuppression without long-term toxicity . DB06681 in clinical and experimental transplantation - progress and promise . DB06681 is a fusion protein composed of the Fc fragment of a human IgG(1) immunoglobulin linked to the extracellular domain of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( P16410 ) . P16410 is a molecule crucial for T-cell costimulation , selectively blocking the process of T-cell activation . DB06681 binds surface costimulatory ligands ( P33681 and P42081 ) of antigen-presenting cells . Studies on nonhuman primates , as well as phase II and III clinical trials are here reviewed . DB06681 is a promising therapy in organ transplantation and in the future can be used to induce tolerance . Cell cycle arrest induced by engagement of Q7Z7D3 on Epstein-Barr virus-positive B-cell lymphoma cell lines . Q7Z7D3 is a recently discovered P33681 family member that has inhibitory effects on T-cell immunity . However , the reverse signalling mechanism of the Q7Z7D3 -expressing cells remains unclear . Previous work has shown that Q7Z7D3 expression was enhanced on B cells following Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection , and engagement of cell-surface-expressed Q7Z7D3 induces cell death of EBV-transformed B cells . Here we found that Q7Z7D3 was constitutively expressed on EBV-positive lymphoma cells , Raji and IM-9 cells , but was not expressed on EBV-negative lymphoma cells ( Ramos ) . Engagement of Q7Z7D3 significantly reduced cell growth of Raji and IM-9 cells and resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0- P55008 phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner . To clarify the mechanism of cell cycle arrest via activation of Q7Z7D3 , cell cycle regulatory factors were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting . We found that Q7Z7D3 triggered down-regulation of P11802 /6 and up-regulation of P38936 expression at both protein and RNA levels . Furthermore , P24941 and cyclin E/D expression was down-regulated by Q7Z7D3 triggering . Additionally , the down-regulation of phospho-AKT and phospho-cyclin E were clearly detected in Q7Z7D3 -activated Raji cells , but the phosphorylation of p53 was constitutively maintained . These results indicate that Q7Z7D3 -mediated signalling on EBV-positive B-cell lymphoma cells modulates the cell cycle through down-regulation of the AKT pathway . Consequently , Q7Z7D3 may be a new potential target for use in EBV-positive lymphoma therapy . Costimulation blockade in autoimmunity and transplantation . Signaling through the costimulation receptors is a critical pathway in the regulation of T-cell activation . The selective costimulation inhibitor abatacept ( cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4-Ig ) binds to P33681 and P42081 on antigen-presenting cells , blocking interaction with P10747 on T cells , and is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis . DB06681 ( DB06681 ) , currently enrolling phase III trials in renal transplantation , was rationally designed from abatacept to bind with more avidity to P42081 , providing the more potent immunosuppressive properties required for immunosuppression in transplantation . This review describes the relevant preclinical studies and summarizes recent clinical findings on these 2 molecules in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation . Although both inhibit the P10747 costimulatory pathway , they are tailored for specific disease states -- abatacept for autoimmune diseases and belatacept for transplantation . Introduction to the use of belatacept : a fusion protein for the prevention of posttransplant kidney rejection . The development of new immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplantation resulted both in better short-term outcomes and in decreased metabolic , cardiovascular , and nephrotoxicity risk . DB06681 belongs to a new class of immunosuppressive drugs that selectively inhibits T-cell activation by preventing P10747 activation and by binding its ligands P33681 -1 and P33681 -2 . The result is an inactivation of costimulatory pathways . A comparative analysis of the BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT datasets showed belatacept regimens resulted in better cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles than did cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) regimens : belatacept likewise outperformed DB00091 in terms of lower blood pressure and serum lipids and less new onset diabetes after transplantation . About 20 % of belatacept-treated patients developed adverse effects which included anemia , pyrexia , neutropenia , diarrhea , urinary tract infection , headache , and peripheral edema . At present , belatacept does not seem to predispose patients to a higher rate of infection than DB00091 maintenance immunosuppression . The risk of posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases was higher in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -seronegative patients than in EBV-seropositive patients , but the risk may be reduced by use of a less intensive regimen and avoidance of EBV-negative patients and of patients whose pretransplant EBV serology is unknown . DB06681 provides a new option for immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplantation , but needs further evaluation in terms of the late effects that may derive from prolonged blockage of the costimulatory system and the induction of tolerance status . P04818 genotype-directed chemotherapy for patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers . BACKGROUND : Retrospective studies indicate associations between TSER ( thymidylate synthase enhancer region ) genotypes and clinical outcomes in patients receiving DB00544 based chemotherapy , but well-controlled prospective validation has been lacking . METHODS : In this phase II study ( NCT00515216 registered through ClinicalTrials.gov , http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00515216 ) , patients with " good risk " TSER genotypes ( at least one TSER*2 allele ) were treated with FOLFOX chemotherapy to determine whether prospective patient selection can improve overall response rates ( ORR ) in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) cancers , compared with historical outcomes in unselected patients ( estimated 43 % ) . RESULTS : The ORR in genotype-selected patients was Q04695 % ( 9 partial responses out of 23 evaluable patients , 95 % CI , 22.2 to 59.2 ) , not achieving the primary objective of improving ORR . An encouraging disease control rate ( DCR , consisting of partial responses and stable diseases ) of 95.7 % was noted and patients with homozygous TSER*2 genotype showed better tumor response . CONCLUSIONS : In this first prospective , multi-institutional study in patients with gastric or GEJ cancers , selecting patients with at least one TSER*2 allele did not improve the ORR but led to an encouraging DCR . Further studies are needed to investigate the utility of selecting patients homozygous for the TSER*2 allele and additional genomic markers in improving clinical outcomes for patients with gastric and GEJ cancers . TRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00515216 . Challenges and opportunities in targeting the costimulation pathway in solid organ transplantation . Signaling through the costimulatory pathway is critical in the regulation of T cell activation . DB01281 , a selective costimulatory antagonist FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis , binds to P33681 and P42081 on antigen presenting cells , blocking the interaction with P10747 on T cells . DB06681 , a second generation P16410 -Ig with 2 amino acid substitutions , has shown considerable promise in clinical transplantation as part of a maintenance immunosuppression regimen . This review will summarize the role of costimulation in T cell activation , detail the development of costimulation antagonists and highlight the pertinent clinical trials completed and ongoing utilizing belatacept as part of an immunosuppressive regimen in organ transplantation . DB06681 and sirolimus prolong nonhuman primate islet allograft survival : adverse consequences of concomitant alefacept therapy . Calcineurin inhibitors ( CNI ) and steroids are known to promote insulin resistance , and their avoidance after islet transplantation is preferred from a metabolic standpoint . DB06681 , a P33681 -specific mediator of costimulation blockade ( CoB ) , is clinically indicated as a CNI alternative in renal transplantation , and we have endeavored to develop a clinically translatable , belatacept-based regimen that could obviate the need for both CNIs and steroids . Based on the known synergy between CoB and P42345 inhibition , we studied rhesus monkeys undergoing MHC-mismatched islet allotransplants treated with belatacept and the P42345 inhibitor , sirolimus . To extend prior work on CoB-resistant rejection , some animals also received P06729 blockade with alefacept ( P19256 -Ig ) . Nine rhesus macaques were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and underwent islet allotransplantation . All received belatacept and sirolimus ; six also received alefacept . DB06681 and sirolimus significantly prolonged rejection-free graft survival ( median 225 days compared to 8 days in controls receiving basiliximab and sirolimus ; p = 0.022 ) . The addition of alefacept provided no additional survival benefit , but was associated with Cytomegalovirus reactivation in four of six animals . No recipients produced donor-specific alloantibodies . The combination of belatacept and sirolimus successfully prevents islet allograft survival in rhesus monkeys , but induction with alefacept provides no survival benefit and increases the risk of viral reactivation . DB01197 and lisinopril suppress production of interleukin-12 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors have immunomodulatory functions and can suppress a number of proinflammatory , monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokines . Interleukin-12 is a cytokine produced primarily by monocytes and macrophages , which plays an essential role in cell mediated immunity and stimulates the development of T helper type 1 immune responses . In this study , we investigated the ability of P12821 inhibitors , captopril and lisinopril , to suppress IL-12 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) . We show that both P12821 inhibitors significantly inhibit production of IL-12 by PBMC stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan ( Q96PN6 ) . Although both P12821 inhibitors also suppressed P01579 production by human anti-CD3/anti- P10747 -stimulated T-cells , the addition of exogenous P01579 to the PBMC stimulation medium does not abrogate the ability of P12821 inhibitors to suppress IL-12 production . Inhibition of IL-12 was not associated with inhibition of IL-1beta , but correlated with the suppression of P12821 . Therefore , suppression of IL-12 may contribute to the immunomodulatory effect of P12821 inhibitors and may be responsible for the beneficial effect of captopril and other P12821 inhibitors in inflammatory or autoimmune conditions in which IL-12 is involved . Plasmid DNA encoding human carcinoembryonic antigen ( P06731 ) adsorbed onto cationic microparticles induces protective immunity against colon cancer in P06731 -transgenic mice . A carcinoembryonic antigen ( P06731 ) -based DNA vaccine , adsorbed onto cationic microparticles of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) ( P00747 ) induced tumor-protective immunity against a lethal challenge of MC38- P06731 colon carcinoma cells in P06731 -transgenic mice that was more potent than that of the corresponding naked DNA vaccine . Boosting with a plasmid encoding murine GM- P04141 increased the vaccine 's efficacy leading to a complete rejection of tumor cells in 50 % of mice . This effect was due to activation of MHC class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells coupled with an increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines P01579 , P01375 and P60568 . Also , specific activation of dendritic cells was indicated by a two-three-fold upregulation of their costimulatory P33681 and MHC class II molecules . This approach may be a promising new strategy for the rational design of cancer vaccines for future clinical applications . Prolonged , low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin , combined with P16410 -Ig , promotes engraftment in a stringent transplant model . BACKGROUND : Despite significant nephrotoxicity , calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ) remain the cornerstone of immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation . We , along with others , have reported tolerogenic properties of anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG , Thymoglobulin® ) , evinced by its ability both to spare Tregs from depletion in vivo and , when administered at low , non-depleting doses , to expand Tregs ex vivo . Clinical trials investigating P33681 / P10747 blockade ( DB06681 , DB06681 ) in kidney transplant recipients have proven that the replacement of toxic CNI use is feasible in selected populations . METHODS : Rabbit polyclonal anti-murine thymocyte globulin ( mATG ) was administered as induction and/or prolonged , low-dose therapy , in combination with P16410 -Ig , in a stringent , fully MHC-mismatched murine skin transplant model to assess graft survival and mechanisms of action . RESULTS : Prolonged , low-dose mATG , combined with P16410 -Ig , effectively promotes engraftment in a stringent transplant model . Our data demonstrate that mATG achieves graft acceptance primarily by promoting Tregs , while P16410 -Ig enhances mATG function by limiting activation of the effector T cell pool in the early stages of treatment , and by inhibiting production of anti-rabbit antibodies in the maintenance phase , thereby promoting regulation of alloreactivity . CONCLUSION : These data provide the rationale for development of novel , CNI-free clinical protocols in human transplant recipients . DB01197 reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor activity in patients with acute myocardial infarction . Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors to patients with myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction . It has also been reported that an elevated level of plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) appears to constitute a marker of the risk of recurrent coronary thrombosis . To determine whether the P12821 inhibitor captopril reduces plasma P05121 inhibitor activity , we measured changes in plasma P05121 activity ( IU/ml ) , tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) antigen ( ng/ml ) , and serum P12821 activity ( IU/L ) in 14 survivors of myocardial infarction receiving captopril therapy ( 37.5 mg daily ) and compared them with the values in 15 placebo-treated patients chosen at random . Blood sampling was performed at 07.00 h . In the captopril-treated group , serum P12821 activity decreased significantly , from 14.0 +/- 0.8 to 11.5 +/- 1.2 IU/L 24 h after captopril therapy ( p < 0.01 ) , and those of P05121 activity and t-PA antigen also decreased significantly-from 11.9 +/- 2.8 to 5.5 +/- 2.2 IU/ml ( p < 0.02 ) and from 9.9 +/- 1.0 to 7.5 +/- 0.9 ng/ml ( p < 0.05 ) , respectively 48 h after captopril therapy . However , the levels of P12821 activity , P05121 activity , and t-PA antigen remained unchanged during the study period in the placebo group . Thus , our data indicate that the administration of captopril to patients with acute myocardial infarction may result in a reduced frequency of recurrent coronary thrombosis by increasing fibrinolytic capacity . Viral-induced P10747 loss evokes costimulation independent alloimmunity . BACKGROUND : DB06681 , a P33681 -specific fusion protein , blocks P10747 - P33681 costimulation and prevents kidney allograft rejection . However , it is ineffective in a sizable minority of patients . Although T-cell receptor and P10747 engagement are known to initiate T-cell activation , many human antigen-experienced T-cells lose P10747 , and can be activated independent of P10747 signals . We posit that these cells are central drivers of costimulation blockade resistant rejection ( CoBRR ) and propose that CoBRR might relate to an accumulation of P10747 (-) T-cells resulting from viral antigen exposure . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We infected C57BL/6 mice with polyomavirus ( a BK virus analog ) , murine cytomegalovirus ( a human cytomegalovirus analog ) , and gammaherpesvirus ( HV68 ; an Epstein-Barr virus analog ) and assessed for P10747 expression relative to mock infection controls . We then used mixed lymphocyte reaction ( P08235 ) assays to assess the alloreactive response of these mice against major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cells . RESULTS : We demonstrated that infection with polyomavirus , murine CMV , and HV68 can induce P10747 downregulation in mice . We showed that these analogs of clinically relevant human viruses enable lymphocytes from infected mice to launch an anamnestic , costimulation blockade resistant , alloreactive response against major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cells without prior alloantigen exposure . Further analysis revealed that gammherpesvirus-induced oligoclonal T-cell expansion is required for the increased alloreactivity . CONCLUSIONS : Virus exposure results in reduced T-cell expression of P10747 , the target of costimulation blockade therapy . These viruses also contribute to increased alloreactivity . Thus , P10747 downregulation after viral infection may play a seminal role in driving CoBRR . Co-signals in organ transplantation . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : The nonimmune effects of currently used immunosuppressive drugs result in a high incidence of late graft loss due to nephrotoxicity and death . As an immune-specific alternative to conventional immunosuppressants , new biotechnology tools can be used to block the costimulation signal of T-cell activation . RECENT FINDINGS : Many experimental studies , particularly preclinical studies in nonhuman primates , have focused on blocking ' classical ' P33681 / P10747 and P25942 / P29965 pathways , which are critical in primary T-cell activation , but also on new P33681 / P10747 and P01375 / P01375 -R pathways families of costimulatory molecules that can deliver positive or negative costimulation signals to regulate the alloimmune response . SUMMARY : DB06681 is a new fusion protein derived from P16410 -Ig that can be used to prevent acute rejection in renal transplantation instead of calcineurin inhibitors . DB06681 can also prevent acute rejection efficiently in humans and , more interestingly , can improve renal function and cardiovascular risk factors in this population . The macrophage mannose receptor induces Q16552 in response to Candida albicans . The cytokine Q16552 controls neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses . The pattern recognition receptor(s) that induce Th17 responses during infection , in the absence of artificial mitogenic stimulation with anti-CD3/anti- P10747 antibodies , remain obscure . We investigated the innate immune receptors and pathogen-associated molecular patterns involved in triggering Th17 responses during pathogen-specific host defense . The prototypic fungal pathogen Candida albicans was found to induce Q16552 more potently than Gram-negative bacteria . Candida mannan , but not zymosan , beta-glucans , Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) agonists , or the Q9HC29 ligand P16444 , induced Q16552 production in the absence of anti-CD3/anti- P10747 antibodies . Candida-induced Q16552 response was dependent on antigen-presenting cells and the macrophage mannose receptor ( MR ) , demonstrating that Candida mannan is not simply a mitogenic stimulus . The O60603 /dectin-1 pathway , but not O00206 or Q9HC29 , amplified MR-induced Q16552 production . This study identifies the specific pattern recognition receptors that trigger the Th17 response induced by a human pathogen in the absence of mitogenic stimulation .
Radiolabeled ligand binding to the catalytic or allosteric sites of O76074 and PDE11 . Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) have been investigated for years as targets for therapeutic intervention in a number of pathophysiological processes . Phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) , which is highly specific for guanosine 3'-5'-cyclic-monophosphate ( cGMP ) at both its catalytic site and its allosteric sites , has generated particular interest because it is potently and specifically inhibited by three drugs : sildenafil ( Viagra , Pfizer ) , tadalafil ( DB00820 , Lilly- Q9Y6W8 ) , and vardenafil ( DB00862 , Bayer GSK ) . Previously , we have used [(3)H]cGMP to directly study the interaction of cGMP with the allosteric sites of O76074 , but because cGMP binds with relatively low affinity to the catalytic site , it has been difficult to devise a binding assay for this particular binding reaction . This approach using measurement of radiolabeled ligand binding continues to allow us to more precisely define functional features of the enzyme . We now use a similar approach to study the characteristics of high-affinity [(3)H]inhibitor binding to the O76074 catalytic domain . For these studies , we have prepared [(3)H]sildenafil and [(3)H]tadalafil , two structurally different competitive inhibitors of O76074 . The results demonstrate that radiolabeled ligands can be used as probes for both catalytic site and allosteric site functions of O76074 . We describe herein the methods that we have established for studying the binding of radiolabeled ligands to both types of sites on O76074 . These techniques have also been successfully applied to the study of binding of radiolabeled O76074 inhibitors to PDE11 , suggesting that these methods are applicable to the study of other PDEs , and perhaps other enzyme families . Persistent Cdk2 inactivation drives growth arrest of P11274 - P00519 -expressing cells in response to dual inhibitor of P12931 and P00519 kinases SKI606 . Complementary inhibition of tyrosine and P12931 kinases implement dual P12931 / P00519 inhibitor effects in chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Here , we show that one such inhibitor , DB06616 , induces persistent Cdk2 inactivation leading to growth arrest of P11274 - P00519 -expressing cells either IM-sensitive or driven to IM-resistance by other events than gene overexpression and point mutations . Inhibition of Akt serine/threonine kinase , a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI-3k ) target that integrates Q92817 TK signaling with membrane-associated P12931 kinases , is a central component of restored expression and subcellular redistribution of Cdk2 regulatory signals ( P38936 and p27 and Cdc25A phosphatase ) in response to DB06616 . The putative roles of growth factor ( namely P08700 ) autocrine loop in P11274 - P00519 -expressing progenitor progression towards a drug-resistant phenotype are discussed . Suppression of androgen receptor-mediated gene expression by a sequence-specific DNA-binding polyamide . P10275 ( AR ) is essential for the growth and progression of prostate cancer in both hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory disease . A DNA-binding polyamide that targets the consensus androgen response element binds the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) promoter androgen response element , inhibits androgen-induced expression of PSA and several other AR-regulated genes in cultured prostate cancer cells , and reduces AR occupancy at the PSA promoter and enhancer . Down-regulation of PSA by this polyamide was comparable to that produced by the synthetic antiandrogen bicalutamide ( DB01128 ) at the same concentration . Genome-wide expression analysis reveals that a similar number of transcripts are affected by treatment with the polyamide and with bicalutamide . Direct inhibition of the AR-DNA interface by sequence-specific DNA binding small molecules could offer an alternative approach to antagonizing AR activity . P09917 -activating protein inhibitors : development of 3-[3-tert-butylsulfanyl-1-[4-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-benzyl]-5-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)-1H-indol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propionic acid ( DB05225 ) . The potent and selective P09917 -activating protein leukotriene synthesis inhibitor 3-[3-tert-butylsulfanyl-1-[4-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-benzyl]-5-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)-1H-indol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propionic acid ( 11j ) is described . Lead optimization was designed to afford compounds with superior in vitro and in vivo inhibition of leukotriene synthesis in addition to having excellent pharmacokinetics and safety in rats and dogs . The key structural features of these new compounds are incorporation of heterocycles on the indole N-benzyl substituent and replacement of the quinoline group resulting in compounds with excellent in vitro and in vivo activities , superior pharmacokinetics , and improved physical properties . The methoxypyridine derivative 11j has an IC(50) of 4.2 nM in a P09917 -activating protein ( P20292 ) binding assay , an IC(50) of 349 nM in the human blood Q06643 (4) inhibition assay , and is efficacious in a murine ovalbumin model of allergen-induced asthma . Compound 11j was selected for clinical development and has successfully completed phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers . Prolonged treatment with bicalutamide induces androgen receptor overexpression and androgen hypersensitivity . BACKGROUND : Various hormone refractory prostate cancer cell models have been established with androgen depletion and have helped to clarify the mechanism for the transition into androgen-depletion independent status . However , the mechanism of bicalutamide resistance remains unclear because few cell models have been generated . METHODS : We generated a bicalutamide-resistant subline , LNCaP- O43633 , from LNCaP after prolonged treatment with bicalutamide . Androgen and/or bicalutamide responsiveness for proliferation and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) secretion were examined in vitro and in vivo . DB00624 and dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) levels in xenografted tumors were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry . P10275 ( AR ) gene mutation and amplification and AR and pAR(210) expression were determined . RESULTS : LNCaP- O43633 did not grow in an androgen-depleted medium and proliferation was stimulated in a tenfold lower concentration of androgen than that of LNCaP . LNCaP- O43633 grew in castrated male mice , and the DB02901 level in grafted LNCaP- O43633 tumors was 7.7-fold lower than in LNCaP tumors . DB01128 stimulated LNCaP- O43633 proliferation and PSA secretion in vitro and the antitumor activity of bicalutamide against LNCaP- O43633 was weaker than that of LNCaP in vivo . Additional AR mutation and AR gene amplification were not detected in LNCaP- O43633 , but AR and pAR(210) expression and PSA secretion in LNCaP- O43633 were higher than in LNCaP . CONCLUSIONS : DB01128 -resistant LNCaP- O43633 exhibited AR overexpression and hypersensitivity to low levels of androgen . Our data suggests that AR overexpression is a significant mechanism of bicalutamide resistance similar to resistance from chronic androgen depletion . In addition , pAR(210) overexpression could be a potential mechanism for hypersensitivity to low androgen in LNCaP- O43633 . Immunohistochemical analysis of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components in the uterine carcinosarcoma : a case report . Uterine carcinosarcoma ( malignant mixed Mullerian tumor ) is an uncommon female genital tract neoplasm characterized by an admixture of epithelial and stromal malignant cells . We report a case of 50-year-old peri-menopausal woman diagnosed to have early-stage ( IB due to FIGO ) uterine carcinosarcoma of the homologous type with superficial ( 3mm ) myo-invasion . The patient showed no clinical symptoms of the disease and had no family history of female genital tract malignancies . Positive immunostaining for steroid receptors ( estrogen-alpha and progesterone receptors ) , cytokeratin , and P00533 was detected only in the carcinomatous area , whereas beta-catenin , BCL-2 , P35354 , p16(INK4a) , P60484 , Q8IUH3 , and vimentin were immunoreactive in both components . P10275 , CD10 , desmin , HER-2/neu , and P04637 were found to be negative either in the carcinomatous or in the sarcomatous area . Tumor proliferative activity was higher in the carcinomatous ( 25 % ) than in the sarcomatous ( 2 % ) component . Based on these findings , immunohistochemical evaluation of multiple receptor status in the carcinomatous and sarcomatous areas of carcinosarcoma may provide a clue to the pathogenesis and hormonal receptor status of this uncommon uterine malignancy . P10275 YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration . X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration . SBMA is caused by polyglutamine repeat expansions in the androgen receptor ( AR ) . To determine the basis of AR polyglutamine neurotoxicity , we introduced human AR yeast artificial chromosomes carrying either 20 or 100 CAGs into mouse embryonic stem cells . The AR100 transgenic mice developed a late-onset , gradually progressive neuromuscular phenotype accompanied by motor neuron degeneration , indicating striking recapitulation of the human disease . We then tested the hypothesis that polyglutamine-expanded AR interferes with CREB binding protein ( CBP ) -mediated transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and observed altered CBP-AR binding and P15692 reduction in AR100 mice . We found that mutant AR-induced death of motor neuron-like cells could be rescued by P15692 . Our results suggest that SBMA motor neuronopathy involves altered expression of P15692 , consistent with a role for P15692 as a neurotrophic/survival factor in motor neuron disease . 5-Azacitidine restores and amplifies the bicalutamide response on preclinical models of androgen receptor expressing or deficient prostate tumors . BACKGROUND : Epigenetic modifications play a key role in the in prostate cancer ( Pca ) progression to a hormone refractory state ( HRPC ) and the current use of agents targeting epigenetic changes has become a topic of intense interest in cancer research . In this regard , 5-Azacitine ( 5-Aza ) represents a promising epigenetic modulator . This study tested the hypothesis that 5-Aza may restore and enhance the responsiveness of HRPC cells to anti-hormonal therapy on P10275 ( AR ) expressing ( 22rv1 ) and AR-deficient ( PC3 ) cells . METHODS : The effects were studied in vitro and in vivo models . This sequential treatment induced in vitro cell cycle arrest and apoptosis both in 22rv1 and PC3 tumor cell lines . RESULTS : This combined treatment up-regulated the expression of P48023 , phospho- Q13158 , p16(INKA) , Bax , Bak , and P38936 ( P38936 ) , and inhibited FLIP , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-XL expression . The re-activation of hormonal response of AR-negative PC3 cell line was partially due to the AR re-expression mediated by 5-Aza treatment . In contrast , the increase in the response to anti-androgenic therapy in 22rv1 did not correlate with AR expression levels . Furthermore , xenograft studies revealed that the combined treatment of 5-Aza with AR-antagonist DB01128 had additive/synergistic effects in repressing tumor growth in vivo and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects seem to be in part mediated by induction of apoptosis . CONCLUSIONS : So , this study strongly suggests a therapeutic potential of 5-Aza in combination with anti-androgen therapy in patients with in AR expressing and AR-deficient HRPC . Q9NZQ7 expression on non-B and non-T cells promotes distinct effects on T- and B-cell responses in autoimmune arthritis . The immune system has developed several regulatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis of adaptive immune responses . T-cell programmed death ( PD ) -1 recognition of Q9NZQ7 ( Q9NZQ7 ) expressed on P25054 and non-lymphoid tissue regulates T-cell activation . We show that Q9NZQ7 (-/-) mice exhibit exacerbated proteoglycan ( PG ) -induced arthritis and increased Th-1 P01730 (+) T-cell responses . Unexpectedly , the PG-specific antibody response in Q9NZQ7 (-/-) mice was diminished . A reduction in the number of peanut agglutinin(+) GC coincided with a decrease in P15391 (+) GL-7(+) CD95(+) GC B cells that was a result of increased caspase-induced apoptosis . The percent of P28907 (+) CD138(+) emerging plasma cells was decreased . Q9NZQ7 (-/-) mice exhibited an increased frequency of P01730 (+) P18621 (hi) P32302 (hi) Q9Y6W8 (hi) CD62L(lo) T follicular helper cells that displayed a hyperactive phenotype with increased expression of mRNA transcripts for Bcl6 , Q9HBE4 , and the apoptosis-inducer molecule P48023 . In cell transfer of Q9NZQ7 (-/-) cells into SCID mice , non-B and non-T cells were sufficient to normalize the antibody response , T-cell hyperactivity , and the development of PG-induced arthritis . These findings indicate that Q9NZQ7 on non-B and non-T cells signals through P18621 on T effector cells to prevent excessive activation and reduce autoimmune arthritis . Furthermore , these findings demonstrate a novel role for Q9NZQ7 expression in promoting B-cell survival by regulating the activation of T follicular helper cell . Effects of zileuton and montelukast in mouse experimental spinal cord injury . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : P09917 ( P09917 ) is the key enzyme in leukotriene ( LT ) biosynthesis from arachidonic acid ( AA ) . Here , we examined the role of the P09917 -product , cysteinyl-LT ( DB00151 -LT ) , with a P09917 inhibitor ( zileuton ) and a DB00151 -LT , receptor antagonist ( montelukast ) , in the inflammatory response and tissue injury associated with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : SCI was induced in mice by the application of vascular clips to the dura via a two-level Q8NHM4 to T7 laminectomy for 1 min . Cord inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring inflammatory mediators ( ELISA ) and apoptosis by annexin V , TUNEL , P48023 staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression ( immunohistochemistry and western blots ) . Motor function in hindlimbs was assessed by a locomotor rating scale , for 10 days after cord injury . KEY RESULTS : SCI in mice resulted in tissue damage , oedema , neutrophil infiltration , apoptosis , tumour necrosis-alpha ( P01375 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression , prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) and leukotriene B(4) ( Q06643 (4) ) production , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) phosphorylation in injured tissue . Treatment of the mice with zileuton or montelukast reduced the spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury , neutrophil infiltration , P01375 , P35354 and pERK1/2 expression , PGE(2) and Q06643 (4) production , and apoptosis . In separate experiments , zileuton or montelukast significantly improved the recovery of limb function over 10 days . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : Zileuton and montelukast produced a substantial reduction of inflammatory events associated with experimental SCI . Our data underline the important role of P09917 and DB00151 -LT in neurotrauma . An overview of phenserine tartrate , a novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease . Existing cholinesterase ( ChE ) inhibitor therapies for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , while effective in improving cognitive , behavioral and functional impairments , do not alter disease progression . Novel drug design studies have focused on the classical ChE inhibitor , (-)-physostigmine , producing alterations in chemical composition and three-dimensional structure , which may offer an improved therapeutic index . The phenylcarbamate derivative , DB04892 , is a selective , non-competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) . In vivo , DB04892 produces rapid , potent , and long-lasting P22303 inhibition . As a possible result of its preferential brain selectivity , DB04892 is significantly less toxic than (-)-physostigmine . In studies using the Stone maze paradigm , DB04892 has been shown to improve cognitive performance in both young learning-impaired and elderly rats . In addition to reducing inactivation of acetylcholine in the brain , DB04892 appears to have a second mode of action . Reduced secretion of beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) has been observed in cell lines exposed to DB04892 , occurring through translational regulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein ( beta- P05067 ) mRNA via a non-cholinergic mechanism . These in vitro findings appear to translate in vivo into animal models and humans . In a small study of patients with AD , DB04892 treatment tended to reduce beta- P05067 and Abeta levels in plasma samples . Clinical studies also reveal that DB04892 ( 5-10 mg b.i.d. ) had a favorable safety and pharmacological profile , produced significant improvements in cognitive function and was well tolerated in patients with AD treated for 12 weeks . Further randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled Phase III studies assessing the efficacy , safety/tolerability and potential disease-modifying effects of DB04892 in patients with AD are currently ongoing . P05067 is a primary androgen target gene that promotes prostate cancer growth . P10275 ( AR ) is a critical transcription factor that regulates various target genes and contributes to the pathophysiology of prostate cancer hormone dependently . Here , we identify amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) as a primary androgen target through chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) combined with genome tiling array analysis ( ChIP-chip ) . ChIP-treated DNA were obtained from prostate cancer LNCaP cells with R1881 or vehicle treatment using AR or acetylated histone H3 antibodies . Ligand-dependent AR binding was further enriched by PCR subtraction . Using chromosome 21/22 arrays , we identified P05067 as one of the androgen-regulated genes with adjacent functional AR binding sites . P05067 expression is androgen-inducible in LNCaP cells and P05067 immunoreactivity was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer . Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies revealed that P05067 promotes the tumor growth of prostate cancer . The present study reveals a novel P05067 -mediated pathway responsible for the androgen-dependent growth of prostate cancer . Our findings will indicate that P05067 could be a potential molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer . Modification of the reactivity of three amino-acid residues in elongation factor 2 during its binding to ribosomes and translocation . The accessibility of three amino acids of P13639 , located within highly conserved regions near the N- and C-terminal extremities of the molecule ( the E region and the DB02059 region , respectively ) to modifying enzymes has been compared within nucleotide-complexed P13639 and ribosomal complexes that mimic the pre- and posttranslocational ones : the high-affinity complex ( P13639 ) -nonhydrolysable GTP analog GuoPP[CH2]P ribosome and the low-affinity ( P13639 ) -GDP-ribosome complex , P13639 and ribosomes being from rat liver . We studied the reactivity of two highly conserved residues diphthamide-715 and DB00125 -66 , to diphtheria-toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation and trypsin attack , and of a threonine that probably lies between residues 51 and 60 , to phosphorylation by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase . DB03223 715 and this threonine residue were unreactive within the high-affinity complex but seemed fully reactive in the low-affinity complex . DB00125 -66 was resistant to trypsin in both complexes . The possible involvement of the E and DB02059 regions of P13639 in the interaction with ribosome in the two complexes is discussed . P10275 -mediated antagonism of estrogen-dependent low density lipoprotein receptor transcription in cultured hepatocytes . Postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than women who do not receive hormone treatment . Multiple mechanisms are likely to underlie estrogen 's cardioprotective action , including lowering of plasma low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol . Using an in vitro system exhibiting normal regulation of P01130 ( P01130 ) gene transcription , we show that 17beta-estradiol activates the P01130 promoter in transiently transfected HepG2 cells . P01130 activation by estrogen in HepG2 cells is dependent on the presence of exogenous estrogen receptor , and the estrogen-responsive region of the P01130 promoter colocalizes with the sterol response element previously identified . The estrogen response is concentration dependent , saturable , and sensitive to antagonism by estrogen receptor antagonists . Further , we show that compounds with androgen receptor agonist activity attenuate the estrogen-induced up-regulation of P01130 in our model system . Progestins with androgen receptor agonist activity , such as medroxyprogesterone acetate , also suppress estrogen 's effects on P01130 expression through their androgenic properties . Characterization of the interplay between these hormone receptors on the P01130 in vitro system may allow a better understanding of the actions of sex steroids on P01130 gene expression and their roles in cardiovascular disease . Autophagy is induced through the ROS- P04637 - Q8N682 pathway in response to mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition . Mitoribosome in mammalian cells is responsible for synthesis of 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins , which are integral parts of four mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes ( I , III , IV and V ) . O75616 is a nuclear-encoded GTPase important for the formation of the 28S small mitoribosomal subunit . Here , we demonstrate that knockdown of O75616 by RNA interference inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis and promotes reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation , leading to autophagic vacuolization in HeLa cells . Cells that lack O75616 expression showed a significant conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and an enhanced accumulation of autophagic vacuoles carrying the LC3 marker , all of which were blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA as well as by the ROS scavenger Q9C000 . Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis either by O75616 siRNA or chloramphenicol ( CAP ) , a specific inhibitor of mitoribosomes , induced autophagy in HTC-116 P04637 ( +/+ ) cells , but not in HTC-116 P04637 ( -/- ) cells , indicating that tumor protein 53 ( P04637 ) is essential for the autophagy induction . The ROS elevation resulting from mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition induced P04637 expression at transcriptional levels by enhancing P04637 promoter activity , and increased P04637 protein stability by suppressing P04637 ubiquitination through Q16539 /p38 MAPK-mediated P04637 phosphorylation . Upregulation of P04637 and its downstream target gene Q8N682 , but not P38936 / P38936 , was required for the autophagy induction in O75616 siRNA or CAP-treated cells . Altogether , these data indicate that autophagy is induced through the ROS- P04637 - Q8N682 pathway in response to mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition . PP2Cdelta ( Ppm1d , O15297 ) , an endogenous inhibitor of p38 MAPK , is regulated along with Trp53 and Cdkn2a following p38 MAPK inhibition during mouse preimplantation development . Preimplantation embryos utilize mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling ( MAPK ) pathways to relay signals from the external environment to prepare appropriate responses and adaptations to a changing milieu . It is therefore important to investigate how MAPK pathways are regulated during preimplantation development . This study was conducted to investigate whether PP2Cdelta ( Ppm1d , O15297 ) is expressed during mouse preimplantation development and to determine the influences of p38 MAPK inhibition on expression of Trp53 ( p53 ) , Ppm1d , ( O15297 ) , and Cdkn2a ( p16 ) during mouse preimplantation development . Our results indicate that Trp53 , Ppm1d , and Cdkn2a mRNAs and TRP53 and PP2Cdelta proteins are expressed throughout mouse preimplantation development . Treatment of 2-cell embryos with DB04338 ( potent inhibitor of p38 MAPK alpha/beta/ Q16539 /11 ) significantly increased Trp53 , Ppm1d and Cdkn2a and Mapk14 mRNA levels at 12 and 24 hr . Treatment of 8-cell embryos with DB04338 for 12 hr increased Trp53 , Ppm1d , and Cdkn2a mRNA levels , but not Mapk14 mRNA levels . Treatment of 8-cell embryos for 24 hr increased Trp53 , and Ppm1d mRNA levels , but decreased Cdkn2a and Mapk14 mRNA levels . Therefore , blockade of p38 MAPK activity is associated with embryo stage specific influences on Trp53 , Ppm1d , Cdkn2a , and Mapk14 expression during mouse preimplantation development . These results define downstream targets of p38 MAPK during preimplantation development and indicate that the p38 MAPK pathway regulates Trp53 , Ppm1d , and Cdkn2a expression . This study increases our understanding of the mechanisms controlling preimplantation development and of the interactions between preimplantation embryos and their culture environments . Targeting eIF4GI translation initiation factor affords an attractive therapeutic strategy in multiple myeloma . BACKGROUND : Deregulation of protein synthesis is integral to the malignant phenotype and translation initiation is the rate limiting stage . Therefore , eIF4F translation initiation complex components are attractive therapeutic targets . METHODS : Protein lysates of myeloma cells ( cell lines/patients ' bone marrow samples ) untreated/treated with bevacizumab were assayed for eIF4GI expression , regulation ( P15559 /proteosome dependent fragmentation ) ( WB , DB00266 , qPCR ) and targets (WB). eIF4GI was inhibited by knockdown and 4EGI-1 . Cells were tested for viability ( ELISA ) , death ( FACS ) and eIF4GI targets ( WB ) . RESULTS : Previously , we have shown that manipulation of P15692 in myeloma cells attenuated P06730 dependent translation initiation . Here we assessed the significance of eIF4GI to MM cells . We demonstrated increased expression of eIF4GI in myeloma cells and its attenuation upon P15692 inhibition attributed to elevated P15559 /proteasome dependent fragmentation and diminished mRNA levels . Knockdown of eIF4GI was deleterious to myeloma cells phenotype and expression of specific molecular targets ( Q99717 /ERα/HIF1α/c-Myc ) . Finally , we showed that the small molecule 4EGI-1 inhibits eIF4GI and causes a reduction in expression of its molecular targets in myeloma . CONCLUSION : Our findings substantiate that translation initiation of particular targets in MM is contingent on the function of eIF4GI , critical to cell phenotype , and mark it as a viable target for pharmacological intervention . Activity and potential role of licofelone in the management of osteoarthritis . Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis . It is a progressive joint disease associated with aging . It may be found in the knees , hips , or other joints . It is estimated that costs associated with osteoarthritis exceed 2 % of the gross national product in developed countries . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are a mainstay in the treatment of inflammatory disease and are among the most widely used drugs worldwide . The main limitation in using NSAIDs consists in their side-effects , including gastrointestinal ulcerogenic activity and bronchospasm . The mechanism of action of these drugs is attributed to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) , and , consequently , the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins . It is hypothesized that the undesirable side-effects of NSAIDs are due to the inhibition of P23219 ( constitutive isoform ) , whereas the beneficial effects are related to the inhibition of P35354 ( inducible isoform ) . Arachidonic acid can also be converted to leukotrienes ( LTs ) by the action of P09917 ( 5- P28300 ) . DB04725 , a P28300 / P36551 competitive inhibitor , decreases the production ofproinflammatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins ( which are involved in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis and in gastrointestinal ( GI ) damage induced by NSAIDs ) and has the potential to combine good analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects with excellent GI tolerability . Preliminary data with this drug seem promising , but further well-designed clinical trials of this agent in the elderly will be necessary before a final evaluation is possible . Current and future pharmacologic options for the management of patients unable to achieve low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol goals with statins . Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) lowering is the mainstay of the current treatment guidelines in the management of cardiovascular risk . P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) are currently the most effective LDL-C-lowering drugs . However , a substantial number of patients do not reach treatment targets with statins . Therefore , an unmet medical need exists for lipid-lowering drugs with novel mechanisms of action to reach the recommended cholesterol target levels , either by monotherapy or combination therapy . Upregulation of the P01130 with squalene synthase inhibitors has shown promising results in animal studies but the clinical development of the lead compound lapaquistat ( DB05317 ) has recently been discontinued . DB00973 combined with statins allowed significantly more patients to reach their LDL-C targets . Other inhibitors of intestinal cholesterol absorption such as disodium ascorbyl phytostanol phosphate ( DB05449 ) and bile acid transport inhibitors have shown positive results in early development trials , whereas the prospect of acyl coenzyme A : cholesterol acyltransferase inhibition in cardiovascular prevention is dire . Selective inhibition of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) by antisense oligonucleotides is a new approach to modify cholesterol levels . The inhibition of apolipoprotein B mRNA is in advanced development and mipomersen sodium ( ISIS 301012 ) has shown striking results in phase II studies both as monotherapy as well as in combination with statins . Metformin suppresses growth of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma via global inhibition of protein translation . Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is the sixth leading cancer in the world ; the main risk factors are alcohol and tobacco use . Advancements in therapies have yet to improve the prognosis of HNSCC . The connection between diabetes and cancer is being recognized , and metformin has been shown to decrease cancer incidence in diabetic patients . Accordingly , here , for the first time , we investigated metformin 's efficacy on the growth and viability of human HNSCC FaDU and Detroit cells . Our results show that metformin treatment ( 5-20 mM ) dose-dependently inhibits the growth of both cell lines . In FaDU cells , metformin caused 18-57 % and 35-81 % growth inhibition after 48 and 72 h treatments , respectively . Similarly , in Detroit 562 cells , 48 and 72 h metformin treatment resulted in 20-57 % and 33-82 % inhibition , respectively . Mechanistically , metformin caused G 1 arrest , which coincided with a decrease in the protein levels of CDKs ( 2 , 4 and 6 ) , cyclins ( D1 and E ) and CDK inhibitors ( p15 , p16 , p18 and p27 ) , but no change in p19 and P38936 . Metformin also decreased the levels of oncogenic proteins Skp2 and β-Trcp . In other studies , metformin decreased the phosphorylation of Q13541 at Ser65 , Thr37/46 and Thr70 sites , but drastically increased the phosphorylation of P13639 at Thr56 and AMPK at Thr172 , which results in global translational inhibition . In summary , the observed wide spectrum of mechanistic effects of metformin on HNSCC cells provides support for the anticancer capability of the drug and its potential use in future therapies .
Anti-thrombin therapy during warm ischemia and cold preservation prevents chronic kidney graft fibrosis in a P81605 model . Ischemia reperfusion injury ( IRI ) is pivotal for renal fibrosis development via peritubular capillaries injury . Coagulation represents a key mechanism involved in this process . Melagatran ( M ) , a thrombin inhibitor , was evaluated in an autotransplanted kidney model , using Large White pigs . To mimic deceased after cardiac death donor conditions , kidneys underwent warm ischemia ( WI ) for 60 min before cold preservation for 24 h in University of Wisconsin solution . Treatment with M before WI and/or in the preservation solution drastically improved survival at 3 months , reduced renal dysfunction related to a critical reduction in interstitial fibrosis , measured by Sirius Red staining . Tissue analysis revealed reduced expression of transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) and activation level of its effectors phospho- P84022 , Q13485 and connective tissue growth factor ( P29279 ) after M treatment . Fibrinolysis activation was also observed , evidenced by downregulation of P05121 protein and gene expression . In addition , M reduced P26447 expression and vimentin staining , which are markers for epithelial mesenchymal transition , a major pathway to chronic kidney fibrosis . Finally , expression of oxidative stress markers Nox2 and P35228 was reduced . We conclude that inhibition of thrombin is an effective therapy against IRI that reduces chronic graft fibrosis , with a significantly positive effect on survival . The murine chemokine receptor P61073 is tightly regulated during T cell development and activation . We have characterized the murine homolog of the HIV-co-receptor P61073 during T cell development and activation . Our data demonstrate that this chemokine receptor , although highly conserved between human and mouse , is differently expressed and regulated in both species . Mitogenic activation resulted in an increase of surface P61073 on murine T cells within 2 days , whereas the receptor was strongly down-regulated on human T cells during this period . Furthermore , intraperitoneal immunization of mice resulted in a strong increase of splenic and mesenteric cytotoxic T cells co-expressing P61073 . It is interesting that , on thymocytes , expression of P61073 is restricted to P01730 +CD8+ cells . Stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha , a natural ligand of P61073 , induced chemotaxis of thymocytes and was found to counteract dexamethasone-induced apoptosis to a certain extent in these cells . Thus , our data show that expression of P61073 is tightly controlled on murine T cells and indicate that this highly conserved chemokine receptor might serve different functions in humans and mice . Lack of significant effects of the type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci Q86VZ6 , O75794 / Q8IU85 , Q04721 , Q9P2N4 , Q6YHU6 , and P19075 / O75473 on diabetes and quantitative metabolic traits . Recently , several novel loci reaching genome-wide significance levels for type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) were identified through a meta-analysis of three genome-wide scans and large-scale follow-up . The aim of our study was to investigate the association of these loci with T2D and related subphenotypes in two cohorts from Germany . We performed an association study of 9 SNPs in or around Q86VZ6 , O75794 / Q8IU85 , Q04721 , Q9H165 , Q9P2N4 , P15692 , P81605 , Q6YHU6 , and P19075 / O75473 with T2D and related quantitative traits ( fasting insulin and glucose , indices derived from OGTT ) in the isolated population of Sorbs ( 205 cases and 695 controls ) and in a mixed German population ( Leipzig ) ( 938 subjects with and 918 without T2D ) . None of the variants was associated with T2D , but the meta-analysis of both cohorts revealed a modest trend of association of rs7578597 in Q6YHU6 with T2D ( p=0.055 ) . Furthermore , Sorbian subjects homozygous for the rs7578597 T-allele had lower mean 30-minute plasma insulin when compared with carriers of the C-allele ( p < 0.05 ) . The T-allele was also nominally associated with higher fasting plasma glucose in the Leipzig cohort ( p < 0.05 ) . Although several other SNPs showed some evidence for association with T2D-related traits the effects were not replicated within our study . Associations of the T2D-risk alleles with T2D or related subphenotypes were overall very weak in the approximately 2 700 subjects studied . This is compatible with the modest effect size of these " second sweep " variants , which will require large-scale association studies on quantitative traits to clarify their role in the pathophysiology of T2D . Technique appraisement of comparative proteomics and screening of differentiation-related protein in gastric carcinoma . BACKGROUND/AIMS : Different differentiations of cancer have resulted in its unique biological characteristics . We screen and appraise differentially expressed proteins in different differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma with comparative proteomics technology in order to find regulatory factors of tumor differentiation related and finally reach the purpose of tumor differentiation reversal . METHODOLOGY : With two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis ( 2-D DIGE ) and liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry ( LC–MS/MS ) , the differentially expressed proteins from 8 patients with different differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma were identified and some factors identified were verified with application of QPCR and Western blot techniques . RESULTS : Significant differences in 35 protein spots were found and 48 kinds of proteins were identified . Other than structural proteins and non-specific protein , six possible proteins associated with tumor differentiation were determined - the serine protease inhibitor B1 ( serine protease inhibitor , clade B , member 1 , P30740 ) , calcium-phospholipid binding protein III ( annexin A3 ) , transcription factor Nm23-H1 , adenine phosphoribosyl-transferase enzyme P07741 ( DB00173 Phosphoribosyltransferase in APO and AMP ) , glutathione S-transferase P1-1 ( Q86UG4 -π-1 ) , antimicrobial peptides P81605 -lL . The identified P30740 , annexin A3 , Nm23-H1 and P07741 were verified , confirming the expression of these factors was in line with proteomics identification . CONCLUSIONS : Protein expression in different differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma was varied . 3D Q99707 measurement : from 1.5 T to 3.0 T . This study investigates some of the issues involved in magnetization transfer ratio ( Q99707 ) acquisition , and in particular aims to determine whether high quality in vivo Q99707 measurements can be made at 3.0 T . The dependency of the Q99707 white-to-grey matter contrast to noise ratio ( P21554 ) on MT pulse characteristics at 1.5 T and at 3.0 T was investigated using an established two-pool model for MT . The simulations showed that MT pulse parameters optimizing the P21554 can be derived for both field strengths . Both the SNR and the P21554 of Q99707 maps at 3.0 T were increased compared to 1.5 T . Images obtained using a safe in vivo Q99707 acquisition protocol based on results of simulations at 3.0 T are presented . P04150 antagonism disrupts the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories in rats . Reconsolidation is the process whereby consolidated memories are destabilized upon retrieval and restabilized to persist for later use . Although the neurobiology of the reconsolidation of both appetitive and aversive memories has been intensively investigated , reconsolidation of memories of physiologically relevant social rewards has received little attention . Social play , the most characteristic social behaviour displayed by young mammals , is highly rewarding , illustrated by the fact that it can induce conditioned place preference ( CPP ) . Here , we investigated the role of signalling mechanisms implicated in memory processes , including reconsolidation , namely glucocorticoid , mineralocorticoid , DB01221 glutamatergic and P21554 cannabinoid receptors , in the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP in rats . Systemic treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone before , but not immediately after , retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP . DB00834 did not affect social play-induced CPP in the absence of memory retrieval . Treatment with the DB01221 receptor antagonist MK-801 modestly affected the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP . However , the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP was not affected by treatment with the mineralocorticoid and P21554 cannabinoid receptor antagonists spironolactone and rimonabant , respectively . We conclude that glucocorticoid neurotransmission mediates the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories in rats . These data indicate that the neural mechanisms of the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories only partially overlap with those underlying the reconsolidation of other reward-related memories . Generation of Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes resistant to the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus ( FK506 ) . Adoptive transfer of autologous Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( EBV-CTLs ) to solid organ transplant ( SOT ) recipients has been shown safe and effective for the treatment of EBV-associated posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLDs ) . SOT recipients , however , require the continuous administration of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent graft rejection , and these agents may significantly limit the long-term persistence of transferred EBV-CTLs , precluding their use as prophylaxis . DB00864 ( FK506 ) is one of the most widely used immunosuppressive agents in SOT recipients , and its immunosuppressive effects are largely dependent on its interaction with the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein ( P62942 ) . We have knocked down the expression of P62942 in EBV-CTLs using a specific small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) stably expressed from a retroviral vector and found that P62942 -silenced EBV-CTLs are FK506 resistant . These cells continue to expand in the presence of the drug without measurable impairment of their antigen specificity or cytotoxic activity . We confirmed their FK506 resistance and anti-PTLD activity in vivo using a xenogenic mouse model , suggesting that the proposed strategy may be of value to enhance EBV-specific immune surveillance in patients at high risk of PTLD after transplantation . Forced dimerization increases the activity of Δ P00533 /EGFRvIII and enhances its oncogenicity . Delta epidermal growth factor receptor ( Δ P00533 ) , an in-frame deletion mutant of the extracellular ligand-binding domain , which occurs in about 30 % of glioblastoma , is a potent oncogene that promotes tumor growth and progression . The signaling of Δ P00533 is ligand-independent and low intensity , allowing it to evade the normal mechanisms of internalization and degradation by the endocytic machinery and hence is persistent . The basis of the oncogenic potential of Δ P00533 remains incompletely understood , including whether dimerization plays an important role in its signal and whether its oncogenic potential is dependent on its relatively low intensity , when compared with the acutely activated wild-type receptor . To examine these two important questions , we have generated a chimeric Δ P00533 that allows forced dimerization via domains derived from variants of the P62942 protein that are brought together by FK506 derivatives . Forced dimerization of chimeric Δ P00533 significantly increased the intensity of its signal , as measured by receptor phosphorylation levels , suggesting that the naturally occurring Δ P00533 does not form strong or stable dimers as part of its low level signal . Interestingly , the increased activity of dimerized , chimeric Δ P00533 did not promote receptor internalization , implying that reduced rate of endocytic downregulation of Δ P00533 is an inherent characteristic . Significantly , forced dimerization enhanced the oncogenic signal of the receptor , implying that the Δ P00533 is a potent oncogene despite , not because of its low intensity . Dexamethasone inhibits interleukin-1β-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in cochlear cells . OBJECTIVES : To investigate the effect of interleukin ( IL ) -1β on matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 expression in cochlea and regulation of IL-1β-mediated P14780 expression by dexamethasone and the molecular and signaling mechanisms involved . METHODS : House ear institute-organ of Corti 1 ( HEI-OC1 ) cells were used and exposed to IL-1β with/without dexamethasone . P04150 antagonist , DB00834 , was used to see the role of dexamethasone . PD98059 ( an extracellular signal-regulated kinases [ ERKs ] inhibitor ) , SB203580 ( a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases [ MAPK ] inhibitor ) , SP600125 ( a c-Jun N-terminal kinase [ JNK ] inhibitor ) were also used to see the role of MAPKs signaling pathway(s) in IL-1β-induced P14780 expression in HEI-OC1 cells . Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and gelatin zymography were used to measure mRNA expression level of P14780 and activity of P14780 , respectively . RESULTS : Treatment with IL-1β-induced the expression of P14780 in a dose- and time-dependent manner . IL-1β ( 1 ng/mL ) -induced P14780 expression was inhibited by dexamethasone . Interestingly , p38 MAPK inhibitor , SB203580 , significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced P14780 mRNA and P14780 activity . However , inhibition of JNKs and ERKs had no effect on the IL-1β-induced P14780 expression . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β strongly induces P14780 expression via activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in HEI-OC1 cells and the induction was inhibited by dexamethasone . Interaction of tacrolimus(FK506) and its metabolites with FKBP and calcineurin . DB00864 (FK506) is a strong immuno-suppressant and shows its activity through inhibiting P60568 mRNA transcription by forming pentameric complex with intracellular receptor ( FK506 binding protein 12 kDa or P62942 ) , Ca2+ , calmodulin , and calcineurin . Here , we report the binding activity to P62942 , the pentameric complex formation and Con-A response inhibiting activities of 7 metabolites . C15-demethylated metabolite(M-3) needed higher quantity to compete in Con-A assay and in pentamer formation assay , although it binds more strongly to P62942 . The result suggests that the ability to form a pentameric complex is not a two step reaction with the first binding to P62942 , but a single step reaction by components for the pentamer formation . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy reduces neuroinflammation and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in the rat model of traumatic brain injury . The acute inflammatory response plays an important role in secondary brain damage after traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Neutrophils provide the main source of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) which also play a deleterious role in TBI . Numerous preclinical studies have suggested that hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) may by beneficial in various noncerebral and cerebral inflammatory diseases . The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of HBOT on inflammatory infiltration and the expression of MMPs in correlation with secondary cell death in the rat model of dynamic cortical deformation ( P81605 ) . Twenty animals underwent P81605 with subsequent HBOT ( 2.8 ATA , two sessions of 45 min each ) ; 10 animals : P81605 and normobaric oxygenation ( 1 ATA ) , 10 animals : not treated after P81605 . Cell death was evaluated by TUNEL . Neutrophils were revealed by myeloperoxidase staining . Immunohistochemical staining for P08253 and -9 and tissue inhibitors of P03956 ( P01033 ) and -2 was also performed and the results were quantitatively evaluated by image analysis . In the animals treated by HBOT , a significant decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive cells and neutrophilic inflammatory infiltration was seen in comparison with nontreated animals and those treated by normobaric oxygen . The expression of P14780 was also significantly lower in the treated group . Staining for P08253 and P16035 did not change significantly . Our results demonstrate that HBOT decreased the extent of secondary cell death and reactive neuroinflammation in the TBI model . The decline of P14780 expression after HBOT may also contribute to protection of brain tissue in the perilesional area . Further research should be centred on the evaluation of long-term functional and morphological results of HBOT . Gene promoter methylation in colorectal cancer and healthy adjacent mucosa specimens : correlation with physiological and pathological characteristics , and with biomarkers of one-carbon metabolism . We evaluated the promoter methylation levels of the P25054 , P16455 , hMLH1 , RASSF1A and CDKN2A genes in 107 colorectal cancer ( CRC ) samples and 80 healthy adjacent tissues . We searched for correlation with both physical and pathological features , polymorphisms of folate metabolism pathway genes ( P42898 , Q9UBK8 , Q99707 , RFC1 , P04818 , and Q9UBC3 ) , and data on circulating folate , vitamin B12 and homocysteine , which were available in a subgroup of the CRC patients . An increased number of methylated samples were found in CRC respect to adjacent healthy tissues , with the exception of P25054 , which was also frequently methylated in healthy colonic mucosa . Statistically significant associations were found between RASSF1A promoter methylation and tumor stage , and between hMLH1 promoter methylation and tumor location . Increasing age positively correlated with both hMLH1 and P16455 methylation levels in CRC tissues , and with P25054 methylation levels in the adjacent healthy mucosa . Concerning gender , females showed higher hMLH1 promoter methylation levels with respect to males . In CRC samples , the Q99707 2756AG genotype correlated with higher methylation levels of RASSF1A , and the P04818 1494 6bp ins/del polymorphism correlated with the methylation levels of both P25054 and hMLH1 . In adjacent healthy tissues , Q99707 2756AG and P04818 1494 6bp del/del genotypes correlated with P25054 and P16455 promoter methylation , respectively . Low folate levels were associated with hMLH1 hypermethylation . Present results support the hypothesis that DNA methylation in CRC depends from both physiological and environmental factors , with one-carbon metabolism largely involved in this process . Lessons learned from the irinotecan metabolic pathway . DB00762 , a camptothecin analogue , is a prodrug which requires bioactivation to form the active metabolite SN-38 . SN-38 acts as a P11387 poison . DB00762 has been widely used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer , small cell lung cancer and several other solid tumors . However , large inter-patient variability in irinotecan and SN-38 disposition , as well as severe but unpredictable diarrhea limits the clinical potential of irinotecan . Intense clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted to elucidate its complicated metabolic pathways and to provide scientific rationale in defining strategies to optimize drug therapy . DB00762 is subjected to be shunted between P08684 mediated oxidative metabolism to form two inactive metabolites P25054 or NPC and tissue carboxylesterase mediated hydrolysis to form SN-38 which is eventually detoxified via glucuronidation by P22309 to form SN-38G . The pharmacology of this compound is further complicated by the existence of genetic inter-individual differences in activation and deactivation enzymes of irinotecan ( e.g. , P08684 , P20815 , P22309 ) and sharing competitive elimination pathways with many concomitant medications , such as anticonvulsants , St . John 's Wort , and ketoconazole . Efflux of the parent compound and metabolites out of cells by several drug transporters ( e.g. , Pgp , Q9UNQ0 , MRP1 , Q92887 ) also occurs . This review highlights the latest findings in drug activation , transport mechanisms , glucuronidation , and CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions of irinotecan in order to unlock some of its complicated pharmacology and to provide ideas for relevant future studies into optimization of this promising agent . Nox-2 is a modulator of fibrogenesis in kidney allografts . We studied the role of classical phagocytic NADPH oxidase ( Nox ) in the pathogenesis of kidney allograft tubulointerstitial fibrosis . Immunofluorescence studies showed that Nox-2 and P13498 ( electron transfer subunits of Nox ) colocalized in the tubulointerstitium of human kidney allografts . Tubular Nox-2 also colocalized with alpha-SMA in areas of injury , suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . Interstitial macrophages ( P34810 (+) ) and myofibroblasts ( alpha-SMA(+) ) expressed Nox-2 while graft infiltrating T cells ( CD3(+) ) and mature fibroblasts ( P26447 (+) ) were Nox-2(-) . These results were confirmed in the Fisher-to-Lewis rat kidney transplant model . Areas of tubulitis were associated with Nox-2 and alpha-SMA , suggestive of EMT . Immunoblot analyses showed that Nox-2 upregulation was associated with oxidative stress ( nitrotyrosine ) and fibrogenesis ( alpha-SMA and phospho- Q15796 ) at 3 weeks and 6 months . Allografts treated with Nox inhibitors ( DPI or apocynin ) for 1 week showed reduced fibronectin and phospho- Q15796 and increased P12830 levels . DB00091 A , TGF-beta1 and angiotensin II increased Nox-2 mRNA levels 2- to 7-fold in vitro ( NRK52E cells ) . Treatment with specific Nox inhibitors ( DPI or apocynin ) prevented the downregulation of P12830 and upregulation of fibronectin transcripts . In aggregate , these studies suggest that Nox-2 is involved in the pathogenesis of allograft tubulointerstitial fibrosis via activation transcription factor Q15796 , EMT and myofibroblasts . DB00134 recycling pathways and antimalarial drug design . 5'-Deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine ( MTA ) is an S-adenosylmethionine metabolite that is generated as a by-product of polyamine biosynthesis . In mammalian cells , MTA undergoes a phosphorolytic cleavage catalyzed by Q13126 to produce adenine and 5-deoxy-5-(methylthio)ribose-1-phosphate ( Q15012 ) . DB00173 is utilized in purine salvage pathways , and Q15012 is subsequently recycled to methionine . Whereas some microorganisms metabolize MTA to Q15012 via Q13126 , others metabolize MTA to Q15012 in two steps via initial cleavage by MTA nucleosidase to adenine and 5-deoxy-5-(methylthio)ribose ( Q99707 ) followed by conversion of Q99707 to Q15012 by Q99707 kinase . In order to assess the extent to which these pathways may be operative in Plasmodium falciparum , we have examined a series of 5'-alkyl-substituted analogs of MTA and the related Q99707 analogs and compared their abilities to inhibit in vitro growth of this malarial parasite . The Q99707 analogs 5-deoxy-5-(ethylthio)ribose and 5-deoxy-5-(hydroxyethylthio)ribose were inactive at concentrations up to 1 mM , and 5-deoxy-5-(monofluoroethylthio)ribose was weakly active ( 50 % inhibitory concentration = 700 microM ) . In comparison , the MTA analogs , 5'-deoxy-5'-(ethylthio)adenosine,5'-deoxy-5'-(hydroxyethylthio)ade nosine ( HETA ) , and 5'-deoxy-5'-(monofluoroethylthio)adenosine , had 50 % inhibitory concentrations of 80 , 46 , and 61 microM , respectively . Extracts of P. falciparum were found to have substantial Q13126 activity . Coadministration of MTA with HETA partially protected the parasites against the growth-inhibitory effects of HETA . Results of this study indicate that P. falciparum has an active Q13126 that can be targeted by analogs of MTA . Endothelial cell transforming growth factor-β receptor activation causes tacrolimus-induced renal arteriolar hyalinosis . Arteriolar hyalinosis is a common histological finding in renal transplant recipients treated with the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus ; however , the pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unknown . In addition to increasing transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β levels , tacrolimus inhibits calcineurin by binding to FK506-binding protein 12 ( P62942 ) . P62942 alone also inhibits TGF-β receptor activation . Here we tested whether tacrolimus binding to P62942 removes an inhibition of the TGF-β receptor , allowing ligand binding , ultimately leading to receptor activation and arteriolar hyalinosis . We found that specific deletion of P62942 from endothelial cells was sufficient to activate endothelial TGF-β receptors and induce renal arteriolar hyalinosis in these knockout mice , similar to that induced by tacrolimus . DB00864 -treated and knockout mice exhibited significantly increased levels of aortic TGF-β receptor activation as evidenced by Q15796 /3 phosphorylation , along with increased collagen and fibronectin expression compared to controls . Treatment of isolated mouse aortas with tacrolimus increased TGF-β receptor activation and collagen and fibronectin expression . These effects were independent of calcineurin , absent in endothelial denuded aortic rings , and could be prevented by the small molecule TGF-β receptor inhibitor SB-505124 . Thus , endothelial cell TGF-β receptor activation is sufficient to cause vascular remodeling and renal arteriolar hyalinosis . Comparison of diafiltration and tangential flow filtration for purification of nanoparticle suspensions . PURPOSE : The study reports evaluation of different purification processes for removing surplus surfactant and formulating stable nanoparticle dispersions . METHODS : Nanoparticle formulations prepared from poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) and polyvinyl alcohol ( P32926 ) were purified by a diafiltration centrifugal device ( P81605 ) , using 300K and 100K molecular weight cut-off ( MWCO ) membranes and a tangential flow filtration ( TFF ) system with a 300K MWCO membrane . The effects of process parameters including MWCO , transmembrane pressure ( P54849 ) , and mode of TFF on nanoparticle purification were evaluated , and two purification techniques were compared to the commonly used ultracentrifugation technique . RESULTS : Both P81605 and TFF systems ( concentration mode at P54849 of 10 psi ) with 300K MWCO membrane removed maximal percent P32926 from nanoparticle dispersions ( 89.0 and 90.7 % , respectively ) . T90 , the time taken to remove 90 % of P32926 in 200-ml sample , however , was considerably different ( 9.6 and 2.8 h , respectively ) . Purified nanoparticle dispersions were stable and free of aggregation at ambient conditions over 3 days . This is in contrast to the ultracentrifugation technique , which , although it can yield a highly purified sample , suffers from drawbacks of a level of irreversible nanoparticle aggregation and loss of fine particles in the supernatant during centrifugation . CONCLUSIONS : The TFF , in concentration mode at P54849 of 10 psi , is a relatively quick , efficient , and cost-effective technique for purification and concentration of a large nanoparticle batch ( > or=200 ml ) . The P81605 technique can be an alternative purification method for nanoparticle dispersions of small volumes . Platelet aggregation inhibition in patients receiving statins either fully or partially metabolized by P08684 . DB00758 therapy is the standard for prevention of cardiovascular thrombotic events . DB00758 is converted to an active thiol by the cytochrome P450 CYP 3A4 and 2C19 enzymes . Recent studies suggest that statins metabolized by P08684 attenuate the anti-aggregatory effect of clopidogrel . We evaluated the effect of P08684 -metabolized statins ( atorvastatin , group 1 ) and partially- P08684 -metabolized statins ( simvastatin , group 2 ) on platelet aggregation inhibition ( P05121 ) when given concomitantly with clopidogrel as compared to patients who were statin naive ( group 3 ) . P05121 was measured by PlateletWorks ( Helena Laboratories ICHOR ) using the platelet Q9H244 receptor agonist ADP ( 20 micromol ) . All patients were on clopidogrel therapy ( 75 mg/day ) . Non-responsiveness was defined as a P05121 of < 35 % . There was no statistical difference in mean P05121 among groups ; a higher prevalence of clopidogrel non-responders was noted in group 1 compared to group 3 ( p=0.002 ) . Multivariate analysis , adjusting for unequal presence of metabolic syndrome and hypertension , we found no statistical difference between groups . Our data suggests that statins , either fully or partially metabolized by P08684 , do not influence P05121 when clopidogrel is used at 75 mg/day , even after adjusting for risk factors . We concluded that concomitant statins with clopidogrel therapy does not influence the effect of clopidogrel in P05121 . Desmopressin ( DB00035 ) induces NO production in human endothelial cells via V2 receptor- and DB02527 -mediated signaling . The hemostatic agent desmopressin ( DB00035 ) also has strong vasodilatory effects . DB00035 is a selective agonist for the vasopressin V2 receptor ( P30518 ) , which is coupled to DB02527 -dependent signaling . DB00035 -induced vasodilation may be due to endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) activation . This hypothesis implies DB02527 -mediated P29474 activation . It also implies wide extrarenal , endothelial P30518 expression . We show that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) the DB02527 -raising agents forskolin and epinephrine increase NO production , as measured by a l-NMMA-inhibitable rise in cellular cGMP content . They also increase P29474 enzymatic activity , in a partly calcium-independent manner . DB02527 -mediated P29474 activation is associated with phosphorylation of residue Ser1177 , in a phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -independent manner . HUVECs do not express P30518 . However , after heterologous P30518 expression , DB00035 induces DB02527 -dependent P29474 activation via Ser1177 phosphorylation . We have previously found P30518 expression in cultured lung endothelial cells . By real time quantitative RT-PCR , we now find a wide P30518 distribution notably in heart , lung and skeletal muscle . These results indicate that DB00035 and other DB02527 -raising agents can activate P29474 via PI3K-independent Ser1177 phosphorylation in human endothelial cells . This mechanism most likely accounts for DB00035 -induced vasodilation . Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 confers endothelial protection and attenuates atherosclerosis . The endothelium plays a central role in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis . One of the main effectors of endothelial dysfunction is P03950 II , and pharmacological approaches to limit P03950 II bioactivity remain the cornerstone of cardiovascular therapeutics . Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ( Q9BYF1 ) has been identified as a critical negative modulator of P03950 II bioactivity , counterbalancing the effects of P12821 in determining net tissue P03950 II levels ; however , the role of Q9BYF1 in the vasculature remains unknown . In the present study , we hypothesized that Q9BYF1 is a novel target to limit endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis . To this aim , we performed in vitro gain and loss of function experiments in endothelial cells and evaluated in vivo angiogenesis and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice treated with AdACE2 . Q9BYF1 -deficient mice exhibited impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation . Overexpression of Q9BYF1 in human endothelial cells stimulated endothelial cell migration and tube formation , and limited monocyte and cellular adhesion molecule expression ; effects that were reversed in Q9BYF1 gene silenced and endothelial cells isolated from Q9BYF1 -deficient animals . Q9BYF1 attenuated P03950 II-induced reactive oxygen species production in part through decreasing the expression of P13498 . The effects of Q9BYF1 on endothelial activation were attenuated by pharmacological blockade of P03950 -(1-7) with A779 . Q9BYF1 promoted capillary formation and neovessel maturation in vivo and reduced atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice These data indicate that Q9BYF1 , in an P03950 -(1-7)-dependent fashion , functions to improve endothelial homeostasis via a mechanism that may involve attenuation of NADPHox-induced reactive oxygen species production . Q9BYF1 -based treatment approaches may be a novel approach to limit aberrant vascular responses and atherothrombosis . Redox signaling in angiogenesis : role of NADPH oxidase . Angiogenesis , a process of new blood vessel formation , is a key process involved in normal development and wound repair as well as in the various pathophysiologies such as ischemic heart and limb diseases and atherosclerosis . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) such as superoxide and H(2)O(2) function as signaling molecules in many aspects of growth factor-mediated responses including angiogenesis . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) is a key angiogenic growth factor and stimulates proliferation , migration , and tube formation of endothelial cells ( ECs ) primarily through the P15692 receptor type2 ( VEGR2 , P35968 /Flk1 ) . P15692 binding initiates autophosphorylation of P35968 , which results in activation of downstream signaling enzymes including P27361 /2 , Akt , and P29474 in ECs , thereby stimulating angiogenesis . The major source of ROS in EC is a NADPH oxidase which consists of Nox1 , Nox2 ( gp91phox ) , Nox4 , P13498 , p47phox , p67phox and the small G protein Rac1 . The endothelial NADPH oxidase is activated by angiogenic factors including P15692 and angiopoietin-1 . ROS derived from this enzyme stimulate diverse redox signaling pathways leading to angiogenesis-related gene induction as well as EC migration and proliferation , which may contribute to postnatal angiogenesis in vivo . The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the recent progress on the emerging area of the role of ROS derived from NADPH oxidase and redox signaling in angiogenesis . Understanding these mechanisms may provide insight into the NADPH oxidase and redox signaling components as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of angiogenesis-dependent cardiovascular diseases and for promoting angiogenesis in ischemic limb and heart diseases . Genetic aspects of ischemic stroke : coagulation , homocysteine , and lipoprotein metabolism as potential risk factors . Stroke is one of the most common causes of death and long term disability throughout the world . It may be the outcome of a number of monogenic disorders or , more commonly , a polygenic multifactorial disease . Numerous studies have investigated the role of genetics in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke , with varied and often contradictory results . The candidate ' stroke risk ' genes affecting haemostasis ( P12259 , F2 , P02671 / P02675 , P08709 , P00488 , P04275 , P00748 , P05121 , P05106 / P08514 , P17301 , P07359 , TPA , Q96IY4 , P07204 , PZ , P08758 ) , homocysteine metabolism ( P42898 , P35520 , Q99707 ) , and lipid metabolism ( apo E , P06858 , P11597 , O95477 , apo AI , apo CIII , apo AIV , apo AV , apo B , apo H , apo(a) , P27169 /2/3 , P01130 / P78380 ) are evaluated in this review . By examining meta-analyses and case-control studies , we made a classification of gene/gene polymorphisms according to the degree of association with ischemic stroke risk . The data assembled could be very useful for further meta-analysis and for future clinical applications . Histone deacetylase inhibitors increase microRNA-146a expression and enhance negative regulation of interleukin-1β signaling in osteoarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes . OBJECTIVE : MiR-146a exerts negative control on inflammatory responses by suppressing cytokine-induced expression of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 ( P51617 ) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 ( Q9Y4K3 ) by impairing NF-κB activity and inhibiting the expression of target genes . Recent study suggests that histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) are involved in the regulation of microRNA ( miRNA ) expression . Therefore , we determined whether HDAC inhibitors can increase miR-146a expression , thereby inhibiting interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) -induced signaling in osteoarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes ( OA-FLS ) . METHOD : MiRNA expression was analyzed using real-time PCR . IL-1β-induced downstream signals and cytokine expression were evaluated using Western blotting and ELISA . Transcription factors regulating promoter activation were identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays . RESULTS : IL-1β treatment of OA-FLS induced a mild ( 1.7-fold ) increase in miR-146a expression that was unable to appropriately downregulate P51617 and Q9Y4K3 expression . HDAC inhibitors , DB02546 ( vorinostat ) , and LBH589 ( DB06603 ) significantly ( 6.1- and 5.4-fold ) elevated miR-146a expression by increasing the binding of the transcription factor NF-κB to the miR-146a promoter , and negatively regulated IL-1β-induced IKK/IκB/p65 phosphorylation signaling and P05231 secretion . The increase in miR-146a expression induced by the HDAC inhibitors was prevented by transfection of miR-146a inhibitor or Q13547 ( class I HDAC ) , P56524 ( class IIa HDAC ) , and Q9UBN7 ( class IIb HDAC ) overexpression , suggesting that they were due to inhibition of HDAC activity . CONCLUSIONS : Our study demonstrated that HDAC inhibitor treatment in OA-FLS significantly increased miR-146a expression and mediated markedly negative regulation to inhibit IL-1β-induced signaling and cytokine secretion . Our results indicate the potential rationale of anti-inflammatory effects for HDAC inhibitors . HIV induces both a down-regulation of Q9NWZ3 that impairs TLR signalling and an up-regulation of the antibiotic peptide dermcidin in monocytic cells . HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of invasive bacterial infections , even at early clinical stages with relatively normal P01730 (+) T-cell counts . The pathogenic mechanisms behind this are not fully understood . However , an increasing number of studies indicate that HIV may impair the innate immunity to bacteria by infecting key cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage . In this study , the effects of HIV infection on the protein profile of undifferentiated monocyte-like THP-1 cells were examined by a mass spectrometric approach based on stable isotope labelling with amino acid in cell culture ( SILAC ) . We identified 651 proteins , of which nine proteins were down-regulated and 17 proteins were up-regulated in HIV-infected THP-1 cells as compared to uninfected controls . Most remarkably , the IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4 ( Q9NWZ3 ) , which is essential for virtually all TLR signalling , was suppressed , whereas the precursor for the antibiotic peptide P81605 was up-regulated in HIV-infected cells . Upon stimulation of either O60603 or O00206 , the HIV-infected THP-1 cells displayed reduced P01375 secretion . The HIV-induced down-regulation of Q9NWZ3 was reconfirmed in monocyte-derived macrophage cell cultures . These data suggests that HIV may impair the TLR signalling cascade for pathogen recognition in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and thus , may reduce the ability of the innate immune system to sense invading pathogens and initiate appropriate responses . A novel mutation in P30518 causing congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with complete resistance to antidiuretic hormone . A 6-month-old male infant presented with failure to thrive . Hypernatraemia and elevated serum osmolality in the presence of low urine sodium and osmolality led to the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus . Administration of DB00035 ( dDAVP ) neither decreased urine volume nor increased urine osmolality indicating congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus . Molecular analysis in the arginine-vasopressin receptor-2 gene ( P30518 ) located on chromosome Xq28 demonstrated a novel 5-base pair deletion ( c.962-966delACCCC ; g.1429-1433delACCCC ) leading to a shift of the reading frame ( p.Asn321fs ) and a premature termination codon implying an absent or non-functional protein . Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide , amiloride and indomethacin led to a favourable clinical course . Enhanced sensitivity to irinotecan by Cdk1 inhibition in the p53-deficient HT29 human colon cancer cell line . Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been associated with advanced colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . DB00762 ( CPT-11 ) , a P11387 inhibitor , has been recently incorporated to the adjuvant therapy . Since the DNA-damage checkpoint depends on p53 activation , the status of p53 might critically influence the response to CPT-11 . We analysed the sensitivity to CPT-11 in the human colon cancer cell line HT29 ( mut p53 ) and its wild-type (wt)-p53 stably transfected subclone HT29-A4 . Cell-cycle analysis in synchronised cells demonstrated the activation of transfected wt-p53 and a P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1)-dependent cell-cycle blockage in the S phase . Activated wt-p53 increased apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to CPT-11 . In p53-deficient cells , cDNA-macroarray analysis and western blotting showed an accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)1/cyclin B complex . Subsequent p53-independent activation of the cdk-inhibitor ( cdk-I ) P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) prevented cell-cycle progression . Cdk1 induction was exploited in vivo to improve the sensitivity to CPT-11 by additional treatment with the cdk-I P99999 -202 . We demonstrate a gain of sensitivity to CPT-11 in a p53-mutated colon cancer model either by restoring wild-type p53 function or by sequential treatment with cdk-Is . Considering that mutations in p53 are among the most common genetic alterations in CRC , a therapeutic approach specifically targeting p53-deficient tumors could greatly improve the treatment outcomes . DB00087 induction and triple maintenance immunotherapy in kidney transplantation from donors after cardiac death . We have used alemtuzumab in combination with triple maintenance immunosuppression in renal transplantation from donors after cardiac death between 2002 and 2006 . We compared outcomes of induction therapy with alemtuzumab with interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) receptor antagonists ( RA ) and anti-lymphocyte antibodies . We used a retrospective sequential study design to examine 170 recipients of kidneys from donor after cardiac death ( P81605 ) for survival , graft survival , time to first rejection , glomerular filtration and complications . Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the following criteria : panel of reactive antibodies > 20 % , retransplants , Afro-American race . Induction with alemtuzumab was compared with anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) in the high-risk and with IL-2RA in the low-risk group . Patients received triple immunosuppression with steroids , mycophenolate mofetil and calcineurin inhibitors . Patient survival , graft survival , rejection rate and glomerular filtration rate did not significantly differ between patients treated with alemtuzumab versus IL-2RAs or ATG . There was a trend towards reduced graft- and patient survival in the alemtuzumab group . There was an increased incidence of cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infections in the alemtuzumab-induced group and a trend towards increased BK virus and bacterial infections . Induction of P81605 kidney transplants with alemtuzumab compared to IL-2RA and ATG has no significant impact on acute rejection . It appears however that CMV infections are increased in patients induced with alemtuzumab . We therefore conclude that induction with alemtuzumab does not confer any advantage over traditional induction agents . Activation of c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase is crucial for the induction of a cell cycle arrest in human colon carcinoma cells caused by flurbiprofen enantiomers . The unselective cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibitor DB00712 and its-in terms of P36551 -inhibition- " inactive " enantiomer R-flurbiprofen have been previously found to inhibit tumor development and growth in various animal models . The underlying mechanisms are unknown . Here , we show that both R- and DB00712 reduce survival of three colon cancer cell lines , which differ in the expression of P35354 ( HCT-15 , no P35354 ; Caco-2 , inducible P35354 ; and HT-29 , constitutive P35354 ) . The IC50 for S- and R-flurbiprofen ranged from 250 to 450 microM . Both flurbiprofen enantiomers induced apoptosis in all three cell lines as indicated by DNA- and PARP-cleavage . In addition , R- and DB00712 caused a P55008 -cell cycle block . The latter was associated with an activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , an increase of the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1 and down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression . Western blot analysis , as well as supershift experiments , revealed that the AP-1 activation was associated with a change of AP-1 composition toward an increase of JunB . The JNK inhibitor SP600125 antagonized R- and DB00712 -induced AP-1 DNA binding , suppression of cyclin D1 expression , and the P55008 -cell cycle block . However , JNK inhibition had no effect on flurbiprofen-induced apoptosis . Hence , the cell cycle arrest is obviously mediated , at least in part , through JNK-activation , whereas R- and DB00712 -induced apoptosis is largely independent of JNK . Although in vitro effects of R- and DB00712 were indistinguishable , only R-flurbiprofen inhibited HCT-15 tumor growth in nude mice , suggesting the involvement of additional in vivo targets , which are differently affected by R- and DB00712 . Examination of the role of magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis : A problem-orientated approach . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) has brought in several benefits to the study of Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . It provides accurate measurement of disease activity , facilitates precise diagnosis , and aid in the assessment of newer therapies . The imaging guidelines for MS are broadly divided in to approaches for imaging patients with suspected MS or clinically isolated syndromes ( Q9NSE2 ) or for monitoring patients with established MS . In this review , the technical aspects of MR imaging for MS are briefly discussed . The imaging process need to capture the twin aspects of acute MS viz. the autoimmune acute inflammatory process and the neurodegenerative process . Gadolinium enhanced Q9BWK5 can identify acute inflammatory lesions precisely . The commonly applied Q9BWK5 marker of disease progression is brain atrophy . Whole brain magnetization Transfer Ratio ( Q99707 ) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( P59665 ) are two other techniques use to monitor disease progression . A variety of imaging techniques such as Double Inversion Recovery ( P30518 ) , Spoiled Gradient Recalled ( SPGR ) acquisition , and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery ( FLAIR ) have been utilized to study the cortical changes in MS . Q9BWK5 is now extensively used in the Phase I , II and III clinical trials of new therapies . As the technical aspects of Q9BWK5 advance rapidly , and higher field strengths become available , it is hoped that the impact of Q9BWK5 on our understanding of MS will be even more profound in the next decade . Synergistic inhibition of breast cancer cell lines with a dual inhibitor of P00533 -HER-2/neu and a Bcl-2 inhibitor . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) ( ErbB1 ) and HER-2/neu ( ErbB2 ) are members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases . These receptors are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and overexpression generally correlates with poor prognosis and decreased survival . DB01259 , a reversible inhibitor of both P00533 and HER-2/neu , has shown some success in achieving clinical responses in heavily pretreated advanced cancer patients . GW2974 is a reversible dual inhibitor similar to lapatinib , but GW2974 was not progressed to clinical trials due to pharmacokinetic issues . Bcl-2 , an anti-apoptotic protein , is also overexpressed in a number of human tumors . Bcl-2 inhibitors induce apoptosis and sensitize cancer cells to other therapies . The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of combining ErbB and Bcl-2 inhibitors on the growth of human breast cancer cell lines . P00533 /HER-2/neu tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( lapatinib and GW2974 ) were combined with Bcl-2 inhibitors ( HA14-1 or GX15-070 ) and the anti-proliferative effects were determined by the MTT tetrazolium dye assay . Combinations were tested in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells , a HER-2/neu transfected MCF-7 cell line ( MCF/18 ) , and a tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell line ( Q99707 -3 ) . A synergistic inhibitory effect was observed with the combination of inhibitors of P00533 -HER-2/neu ( lapatinib or GW2974 ) and Bcl-2 ( GX15-070 or HA14-1 ) on the growth of the MCF-7 , MCF/18 , and Q99707 -3 human breast cancer cell lines . This study suggests that simultaneously blocking the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases and Bcl-2 family of proteins may be a benefit to breast cancer patients . Molecular markers of programmed cell death in donor hearts before transplantation . BACKGROUND : In this study we investigate whether pro-apoptotic , pro-inflammatory and other early signaling markers indicative of increased propensity for cell death processes were evident in human donor heart allografts immediately before transplantation , and whether there is an association with primary graft failure . METHODS : A prospective study was performed utilizing donor left atrial myocardium collected at the time of implantation of hearts from brain-dead donors ( BDD , n = 29 ) . In addition , to explore the potential of donor hearts from donation after circulatory death ( P81605 ) , myocardial samples were obtained during transplantation of lungs from P81605 donors ( n = 6 ) . A comparator reference group ( n = 7 ) consisted of left atrial specimens from patients undergoing mitral valve surgery . RESULTS : Significantly raised levels of caspase-3 specific activity , activated hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1α ) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine were evident in the transplanted hearts ( from BDD ) that developed primary graft failure ( n = 11 ) . P81605 hearts did not differ from BDD with regard to mRNA expression levels of FAS , Bax , P05231 and caspase-3 . Although P81605 hearts exhibited lower caspase-3 specific activity and activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1 protein , they had higher levels of mRNA for NF-κB , Bnip3 and caspase-1 mRNA . Increased 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels reflected greater oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species-related DNA fragmentation . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicate a significant role of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory activity in allografts that subsequently exhibit primary graft failure . The relatively lower levels of apoptotic and inflammatory activity in P81605 hearts suggest they may represent a potentially usable donor cardiac allograft pool . This possibility requires further detailed molecular and clinical research . Steatohepatitis in laboratory opossums exhibiting a high lipemic response to dietary cholesterol and fat . Plasma VLDL and LDL cholesterol were markedly elevated ( > 40-fold ) in high-responding opossums , but moderately elevated ( 6-fold ) in low-responding opossums after they had consumed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet for 24 wk . In both high- and low-responding opossums , plasma triglycerides were slightly elevated , threefold and twofold , respectively . Dietary challenge also induced fatty livers in high responders , but not in low responders . We studied the lipid composition , histopathological features , and gene expression patterns of the fatty livers . Free cholesterol ( 2-fold ) , esterified cholesterol ( 11-fold ) , and triglycerides ( 2-fold ) were higher in the livers of high responders than those in low responders , whereas free fatty acid levels were similar . The fatty livers of high responders showed extensive lobular disarray by histology . Inflammatory cells and ballooned hepatocytes were also present , as were perisinusoidal fibrosis and ductular proliferation . In contrast , liver histology was normal in low responders . Hepatic gene expression revealed differences associated with the development of steatohepatitis in high responders . The accumulation of hepatic cholesterol was concomitant with upregulation of the P04035 gene and downregulation of the Q02318 , Q9H221 , and P21439 genes . Genes involved in inflammation ( P01375 , P19838 , and P35354 ) and in oxidative stress ( P13498 and P14598 ) were upregulated . Upregulation of the growth factor genes ( PDGF and P01137 ) and collagen genes ( Col1A1 , Col3A1 , and Col4A1 ) was consistent with fibrosis . Some of the histological characteristics of the fatty livers of high-responding opossums imitate those in the livers of humans with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis . Role of NAD(P)H oxidase in transforming growth factor-beta1-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 expression in rat renal tubular epithelial cells . AIM : This study investigated the role of NAD(P)H oxidase in transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) -induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) , and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) expression in rat renal tubular epithelial Q7Z2Y5 -52E cells . METHODS : The cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TGF-beta1 , either in the presence or absence of the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor , diphenyleneiodonium ( DPI ) , or short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) suppressing p67phox expression . Expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits , P13500 , and P05231 at the mRNA levels was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , while expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p67phox protein was analyzed by western blot and P13500 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . The cellular ROS generation was visualized using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate by confocal microscopy . RESULTS : Compared to control , TGF-beta1 upregulated NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p67phox mRNA by 3.59-fold ( P < 0.01 ) , but had no effect on P13498 , gp91phox and p47phox NAD(P)H subunits . TGF-beta1 was also able to significantly increase intracellular ROS ( P < 0.05 ) , P13500 ( P < 0.01 ) and P05231 ( P < 0.05 ) expression in Q7Z2Y5 -52E cells . Further studies showed that generation of ROS and upregulation of P13500 and P05231 by TGF-beta1 were significantly blocked by addition of DPI or shRNA-p67phox ( P < 0.01 ) , suggesting that these effects were NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent . CONCLUSION : TGF-beta1 differentially regulates the expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits and mediates P13500 and P05231 expression in rat renal tubular cells via the NAD(P)H oxidase/p67phox-dependent mechanism . DB05039 inhibits tumor cell invasiveness and P14780 expression by suppressing IKK/NF-κB activation . The β2 adrenergic receptor ( P07550 ) is a G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor expressed in the human respiratory tract and widely recognized as a pharmacological target for treatments of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( P48444 ) . Although a number of P07550 agonists have been developed for use in asthma therapy , indacaterol is the only ultra-long-acting inhaled β2-agonist ( LABA ) approved by the FDA for relieving the symptoms in P48444 patients . The precise molecular mechanism underlying the pharmacological effect of indacaterol , however , remains unclear . Here , we show that β-arrestin-2 mediates the internalization of P07550 following indacaterol treatment . Moreover , we demonstrate that indacaterol significantly inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) -induced NF-κB activity by reducing levels of both phosphorylated-IKK and -IκBα , thereby decreasing NF-κB nuclear translocation and the expression of P14780 , an NF-κB target gene . Subsequently , we show that indacaterol significantly inhibits P01375 -α/NF-κB-induced cell invasiveness and migration in a human cancer cell line . In conclusion , we propose that indacaterol may inhibit NF-κB activity in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner , preventing further lung damage and improving lung function in P48444 patients . P38936 -activated kinase ( Pak ) regulates NADPH oxidase activation in human neutrophils . The phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase plays an instrumental role in host defense and contributes to microbicial killing by releasing highly reactive oxygen species . This multicomponent enzyme is composed of membrane and cytosolic components that assemble in the plasma membrane or phagolysosome . While the guanosine S'-triphosphatase ( GTPase ) Rac2 has been shown to be a critical regulator of NADPH oxidase activity and assembly , the role of its effector , P38936 -activated kinase ( Pak ) , in oxidase function has not been well defined . Using HIV-1 Tat-mediated protein transduction of Pak inhibitory domain , we show here that Pak activity is indeed required for efficient superoxide generation in intact neutrophils . Furthermore , we show that Pak translocates to the plasma membrane upon N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ( fMLF ) stimulation and colocalizes with translocated p47(phox) and with P13498 , a subunit of flavocytochrome b558 . Although activated Pak phosphorylated several essential serine residues in the C-terminus of p47phox , direct binding to p47phox was not observed . In contrast , active Pak bound directly to P13498 , suggesting flavocytochrome b was the oxidase-associated membrane target of this kinase and this association may facilitate further phosphorylation of p47phox in the assembling NADPH oxidase complex . Combined adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and P34059 deficiency . We describe a Czech patient with combined adenine phosphoribosyltransferase ( P07741 ) deficiency ( 2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis ) and P34059 ( P34059 ) deficiency ( mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA , Morquio disease A ) . DB00173 and its extremely insoluble derivative , 2,8-dihydroxyadenine , were identified in the urine , and P07741 deficiency was confirmed in erythrocytes . There was excessive excretion of keratan sulfate in the urine , and P34059 deficiency was confirmed in leukocytes . P34059 and P07741 are both located on chromosome 16q24.3 , suggesting that the patient had a deletion involving both genes . PCR amplification of genomic DNA indicated that a novel junction was created by the fusion of sequences distal to P34059 exon 2 and proximal to P07741 exon 3 , and that the size of the deleted region was approximately 100 kb . The deletion breakpoints were localized within P34059 intron 2 and P07741 intron 2 . Several other genes , including the alpha subunit of cytochrome B ( P13498 ) , which is deleted or mutated in the autosomal form of chronic granulomatous disease , are located in the 16q24.3 region , but PCR amplification showed that this gene was present in the proband . A patient with hemizygosity for P34059 deficiency and P07741 deficiency has been reported from Japan recently . These findings indicate that : ( i ) P07741 is located telomeric to P34059 ; ( ii ) P34059 and P07741 are transcribed in the same orientation ( centromeric to telomeric ) ; and ( iii ) combined P07741 / P34059 deficiency may be more common than hitherto realized . DB00452 -arginine conjugate , a novel HIV-1 Tat antagonist : synthesis and anti-HIV activities . HIV-1 transactivating protein Tat is essential for virus replication and progression of HIV disease . HIV-1 Tat stimulates transactivation by binding to HIV-1 transactivator responsive element ( TAR ) RNA , and while secreted extracellularly , it acts as an immunosuppressor , an activator of quiescent T-cells for productive HIV-1 infection , and by binding to CXC chemokine receptor type 4 ( P61073 ) as a chemokine analogue . Here we present a novel HIV-1 Tat antagonist , a neomycin B-hexaarginine conjugate ( NeoR ) , which inhibits Tat transactivation and antagonizes Tat extracellular activities , such as increased viral production , induction of P61073 expression , suppression of CD3-activated proliferation of lymphocytes , and upregulation of the CD8 receptor . Moreover , Tat inhibits binding of fluoresceine isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -labeled NeoR to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , indicating that Tat and NeoR bind to the same cellular target . This is further substantiated by the finding that NeoR competes with the binding of monoclonal Abs to P61073 . Furthermore , NeoR suppresses HIV-1 binding to cells . Importantly , NeoR accumulates in the cell nuclei and inhibits the replication of M- and T-tropic HIV-1 laboratory isolates ( EC(50) = 0.8-5.3 microM ) . A putative model structure for the TAR-NeoR complex , which complies with available experimental data , is presented . We conclude that NeoR is a multitarget HIV-1 inhibitor ; the structure , and molecular modeling and dynamics , suggest its binding to TAR RNA . NeoR inhibits HIV-1 binding to cells , partially by blocking the P61073 HIV-1 coreceptor , and it antagonizes Tat functions . NeoR is therefore an attractive lead compound , capable of interfering with different stages of HIV infection and AIDS pathogenesis . [ Quantitative analysis of P11387 activity in human and rat glioma : characterization and mechanism of resistance to antitopoisomerase chemical , camptothecin-11 ] . DB00762 ( CPT-11 ) is a new derivation of camptothecin , a plant alkaloid antitumor agent . Previous studies indicated that antitumor activity of CPT-11 was mediated through interaction of the drugs with its target enzyme , P11387 ( topo I ) . In this study , we studied the relation between sensitivity to CPT-11 and topo I activity of glioma cells . Furthermore , we established CPT-11 resistant cell lines in order to elucidate potential mechanisms of drug resistance . A clear correlation between the sensitivities to CPT-11 and topo I activities in surgical glioma specimens was demonstrated . Activities of topo I in CPT-11 sensitive group ( IC50 values for CPT-11 ; < 50 micrograms/ml ) tended to be higher than those in CPT-11 resistant group ( IC50 values ; > or = 50 ) . Topo I activity may serve as a novel marker to predict the sensitivity of gliomas to topo inhibitors . CPT-11 resistance cell lines ( T98G/CPT-11 and P13671 ) respectively exhibit a 5.4- and 7.3-fold increase in resistance to CPT-11 . No differences in topo I activity and intracellular accumulation of CPT-11 were observed between parent and CPT-11 resistant lines . On the other hand , topo I from T98G/CPT-11 and P13671 /CPT-11 cells were at least 4- and 2-fold resistant to the inhibitory effect of the CPT-11 on the relaxation activity of topo I in comparison with their parent lines . This enzymological difference may be responsible for the resistance to CPT-11 . Growth factors expression in patients with erosive esophagitis . Although the pathogenesis and treatment of erosive esophagitis ( EE ) is well recognized , little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of mucosal healing in EE patients . In this pilot study , we enrolled typical EE patients to evaluate what kinds of growth factors and their receptors were activated in their injured esophageal mucosa . Forty endoscopically proved EE patients were consecutively enrolled . Messenger RNA expressions , which includes keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) and its receptor ( P21802 ) , epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) and its receptor ( HGFR ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 , were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Data were compared between the injured EE mucosa and their normal esophageal mucosa above EE . The mRNA expressions of P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and P35354 , but not P00533 , KGF , P21802 , P09038 , and P23219 , were significantly increased in the injured mucosa of EE patients compared with those of normal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) . The study found that P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and , P35354 are activated in the injured mucosa of EE patients ; their activation might be involved in mucosal repair and ulcer healing of EE . High loading dose of clopidogrel is unable to satisfactorily inhibit platelet reactivity in patients with glycoprotein IIIA gene polymorphism : a genetic substudy of PRAGUE-8 trial . The study aimed to assess the impact of nine polymorphisms of genes encoding platelet receptors , enzymes , and hemostatic factors on clopidogrel efficacy to inhibit platelet reactivity in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective coronary angiography either with or without ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention . The study was performed as a genetic substudy of the PRAGUE-8 trial . Ninety-five patients pretreated with 600 mg clopidogrel at least 6 h prior to coronary angiography were tested . Baseline platelet reactivity to ADP was assessed before the drug was administered . DB00758 efficacy was tested again at 12 and 28 h after administration . Polymorphisms of platelet receptors , glycoprotein ( GP ) Ia ( 807C/T ) , Q9HCN6 ( 13254C/T ) , P05106 ( PlA1/PlA2 ) , P25116 ( IVSn-14A/T ) , Q9H244 ( 32C/T ) , Q9H244 ( H1/H2 ) haplotype , gene variations of cyclooxygenase-1 , Leiden , and factor II mutations were studied . Flow cytometric tests of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation states were used as a measure of drug efficacy . None of the gene polymorphisms influenced baseline ADP-induced platelet reactivity significantly . Twenty-eight hours after drug administration , differences in suppression of ADP-induced platelet reactivity were observed between polymorphism-positive and polymorphism-negative patients . Inhibition of platelet reactivity , after 600 mg of clopidogrel , was significantly less in carriers of PlA2 ( P=0.009 ) for mean decrease in platelet reactivity index . The proportion of clopidogrel nonresponders ( platelet reactivity index > 50 % ) was apparently higher in PlA2 carriers in comparison with PlA1/PlA1 patients ( 54 vs. 24 % , P=0.082 ) . A 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel failed to acceptably inhibit platelet reactivity in patients who were positive for the PlA2 polymorphism . Genotype frequencies of 50 polymorphisms for 241 Japanese non-cancer patients . This paper lists the genotype frequencies of 50 polymorphisms of 37 genes ( P05091 , P07550 , P13945 , P21964 , P16671 , P25025 , P24385 , P35354 , P11509 , P05093 , P11511 , IGF1 , IL-1A , IL-1B , IL-1RN , IL-1R1 , P05231 , P10145 , P22301 , P41159 , Le , L-myc , P05164 , Q99707 , P42898 , P21397 , P15559 , O15527 , p53 , p73 , Se , P31213 , TGF-B , P01375 -A , P01375 -B , P18074 , and P18887 ) and 6 sets of combined genotype frequencies for 241 non-cancer Japanese outpatients . Though the genotype frequencies of 25 polymorphisms have already been reported in our previous papers , 15 polymorphisms ( P16671 A52C , P25025 C785T , P24385 G870A , IGF1 C/T at intron 2 and G2502T , IL-1A 46-bp VNTR , IL-1R1 C-116T , P05231 Ins/Del 17C , P10145 A-278T and C74T , IL- 10 T-819C , P41159 A-2548G , P31213 2-bp VNTR , P18074 Lys751Gln , and P18887 Arg399Gln ) and six sets of combined genotype frequencies ( IL-1B C-31T and IL-1A C-889T , IL-1B C-31T and IL-1RN 86-bp VNTR , IL-1B C-31T and IL-1R1 C-116T , P01375 -A G-308A and P01375 -B A252G , P31213 Val89Leu and 2-bp VNTR , and P18887 Arg399Gln and P18074 Lys751Gln ) were reported in this paper for the first time for Japanese . Although microarray technology will produce this kind of information in near future , this is the first document that reports the genotype/allele frequencies among Japanese for an archival purpose . P01308 resistance determines phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase overactivation in metabolic syndrome patients . OBJECTIVE : Metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) is associated with insulin resistance and increases the cardiovascular risk . Oxidative stress constitutes a potential mechanism that links insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease . The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of NADPH oxidase activation with insulin resistance , and the effect of this interaction on the cardiovascular risk in MetS patients . METHODS : NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production and expression was evaluated by luminescence and western blot , respectively , in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 125 patients with MetS . P01308 resistance was defined by the homeostasis model assessment index . P14780 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in plasma samples . To ascertain the mechanisms involved in vivo , we performed in-vitro experiments in cultured macrophages . RESULTS : Fifty-six percent of patients with MetS showed insulin resistance . Plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels were higher ( P < 0.05 ) in insulin-resistant patients than in patients with insulin sensitivity . NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production was augmented ( P < 0.05 ) in insulin-resistant patients with respect to insulin-sensitive patients . The interaction between insulin resistance and abnormally high NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide production was associated with the highest matrix metalloproteinase-9 values . Increased NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production was significantly associated with higher NADPH oxidase P13498 expression in insulin-resistant than in insulin-sensitive patients . Interestingly , insulin upregulated P13498 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in murine macrophages . CONCLUSION : P01308 resistance is associated with phagocytic NADPH oxidase activation . This association results in the highest cardiovascular risk in MetS patients . Cardioprotective mechanism of telmisartan via P37231 - P29474 pathway in dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats . BACKGROUND : Recently , some investigators have shown that telmisartan , an angiotensin II ( Ang II ) -receptor blocker ( ARB ) , is a partial agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) . We investigate whether telmisartan improves cardiovascular remodeling associated with the production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) through P37231 , inhibits the Rho-kinase pathway , and suppresses oxidative stress in Dahl salt-sensitive ( DS ) hypertensive rats . METHODS : Telmisartan ( 1 mg/kg per day ) or telmisartan plus P37231 inhibitor , GW9662 ( 1 mg/kg per day ) was administered from the age of 6-11 weeks . Age-matched male Dahl salt-resistant ( DR ) rats served as a control group . RESULTS : The levels of P29474 and P37231 expression , and P29474 phosphorylation were significantly lower in DS rats than in DR rats . Chronic telmisartan treatment in DS rats significantly increased these parameters , but not telmisartan plus GW9662 . Telmisartan effectively inhibited the vascular lesion formation such as medial thickness and perivascular fibrosis , but not telmisartan plus GW9662 . Moreover , upregulated RhoA protein , Rho-kinase mRNA , and myosin light-chain phosphorylation in DS rats was decreased by telmisartan to a similar degree as observed after treatment with Y-27632 , a selective Rho-kinase inhibitor . In addition , NAD(P)H oxidase P13498 , p47phox , gp91phox expression , and mitogen-activated protein kinase and its downstream effector P08133 S6 kinase phosphorylation in DS rats was also inhibited by telmisartan . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that the cardioprotective mechanism of telmisartan may be partly due to improvement of endothelial function associated with P37231 - P29474 , oxidative stress , and Rho-kinase pathway . Selective measurement of white matter and gray matter diffusion trace values in normal human brain . The trace of the diffusion tensor ( or simply the trace ) is diagnostically valuable for detecting acute ischemic lesions . A number of studies indicate that the trace of human gray matter ( GM ) and white matter ( WM ) are quite similar . This is somewhat surprising considering the different cellular environments of GM and WM . It is possible that partial volume averaging ( P32926 ) effects between GM and WM , inherent in many of the ultrafast imaging sequences used for diffusion measurements , are responsible for this observation . In order to minimize P32926 effects , the trace values of GM and WM have been selectively measured by implementing double inversion recovery ( P30518 ) echo planar imaging ( P10646 ) pulse sequences . Results on six normal volunteers indicate that the trace values of WM and GM are not statistically different . Changes in Dermatomal Somatosensory Evoked Potentials according to Stimulation Intensity and Severity of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the change of latency of cervical dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential ( P81605 ) according to stimulation intensity ( SI ) and severity of carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . METHODS : Stimulation sites were the P13671 , P10643 , and Q99618 dermatomal areas . Two stimulation intensities 1.5×sensory threshold ( ST ) and 2.5×ST were used on both normal and CTS patients . RESULTS : In moderate CTS , the latencies of P13671 and P10643 P81605 during 1.5×ST SI and those of P10643 P81605 during 2.5×ST SI were significantly delayed compared with the values of normal subjects . Significant correlation between the latency of P10643 P81605 of 2.5×ST stimulation and the median sensory nerve conduction velocity was observed . CONCLUSION : We suggest that these data can aid in the diagnosis of cervical sensory radiculopathy using low stimulation intensity and of those who have cervical sensory radiculopathy combined with CTS patients . P33261 polymorphism is associated with reduced clopidogrel response in cerebrovascular disease . PURPOSE : DB00758 is a prodrug that requires transformation into an active metabolite by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) in the liver in order to irreversibly inhibit the Q9H244 adenosine diphosphate platelet receptor . P33261 polymorphism has been reported to correlate with reduced antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel in coronary artery disease . We assessed the association between P33261 polymorphism and clopidogrel resistance in patients with cerebrovascular disease . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We retrospectively gathered data from patients who experienced cerebrovascular disease , received clopidogrel , and were tested for clopidogrel resistance and P33261 polymorphism . DB00758 resistance was tested by the VerifyNow Q9H244 system , and the P33261 polymorphism was tested by the Seeplex P33261 P12821 Genotyping system . DB00758 resistance was expressed in Q9H244 reaction units ( PRU ) and percent inhibition . High PRU and low percent inhibition suggests clopidogrel resistance . P33261 polymorphisms were expressed as extensive , intermediate , and poor metabolizers . DB00758 resistance was assessed according to the subgroup of P33261 polymorphism . RESULTS : A total of 166 patients were evaluated . The PRU values of extensive P33261 metabolizers ( 195.0±84.9 ) were significantly lower than those of intermediate and poor metabolizers ( 237.9±88.0 , 302.2±58.9 ) . The percent inhibition of extensive metabolizers ( 44.6±21.8 ) was significantly higher than that of intermediate and poor metabolizers ( 30.5±21.5 , 14.0±13.4 ) . CONCLUSION : Intermediate and poor metabolizing P33261 polymorphism is associated with reduced clopidogrel antiplatelet activity in patients with cerebrovascular disease . The clinical implications of this finding require further investigation . P48061 and [N33A] P48061 in 5637 and HeLa cells : regulating P00533 phosphorylation via calmodulin/calcineurin . In the human neoplastic cell lines 5637 and HeLa , recombinant P48061 elicited , as expected , downstream signals via both G-protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent pathways responsible for inducing a rapid and a late wave , respectively , of P27361 /2 phosphorylation . In contrast , the structural variant [N33A] P48061 triggered no β-arrestin-dependent phosphorylation of P27361 /2 , and signaled via G protein-dependent pathways alone . Both P48061 and [N33A] P48061 , however , generated signals that transinhibited P00533 phosphorylation via intracellular pathways . 1 ) Prestimulation of P61073 / P00533 -positive 5637 or HeLa cells with P48061 modified the HB- P01133 -dependent activation of P00533 by delaying the peak phosphorylation of tyrosine 1068 or 1173 . 2 ) Prestimulation with the synthetic variant [N33A] P48061 , while preserving P61073 -related chemotaxis and P61073 internalization , abolished P00533 phosphorylation . 3 ) In cells knockdown of β-arrestin 2 , P48061 induced a full inhibition of P00533 like [N33A] P48061 in non-silenced cells . 4 ) P00533 phosphorylation was restored as usual by inhibiting PCK , calmodulin or calcineurin , whereas the inhibition of CaMKII had no discernable effect . We conclude that both recombinant P48061 and its structural variant [N33A] P48061 may transinhibit P00533 via G-proteins/calmodulin/calcineurin , but [N33A] P48061 does not activate β-arrestin-dependent P27361 /2 phosphorylation and retains a stronger inhibitory effect . Therefore , we demonstrated that P48061 may influence the magnitude and the persistence of signaling downstream of P00533 in turn involved in the proliferative potential of numerous epithelial cancer . In addition , we recognized that [N33A] P48061 activates preferentially G-protein-dependent pathways and is an inhibitor of P00533 .
Very early-onset lone atrial fibrillation patients have a high prevalence of rare variants in genes previously associated with atrial fibrillation . BACKGROUND : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia . Currently , 14 genes important for ion channel function , intercellular signaling , and homeostatic control have been associated with AF . OBJECTIVE : We hypothesized that rare genetic variants in genes previously associated with AF had a higher prevalence in early-onset lone AF patients than in the background population . METHODS : Sequencing results of P51787 , Q12809 , Q14524 , P22460 , Q9UK17 , P15382 , 2 , 5 , P63252 , P35498 -3B , P01160 , and P36382 from 192 early-onset lone AF patients were compared with data from the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Exome Variant Server consisting of 6503 persons from 18 different cohort studies . RESULTS : Among the lone AF patients , 29 ( 7.6 % ) alleles harbored a novel or very rare variant ( minor allele frequency < 0.1 in the Exome Variant Server ) , a frequency that was significantly higher than what was found in the reference database ( 4.1 % ; with minor allele frequency < 0.1 ; P = .0012 ) . Previously published electrophysiological data showed that 96 % ( n = 23 ) of the rare variants that has been functionally investigated ( n = 24 ) displayed significant functional changes . CONCLUSIONS : We report a much higher prevalence of rare variants in genes associated with AF in early-onset lone AF patients than in the background population . By presenting these data , we believe that we are the first to provide quantitative evidence for the role of rare variants across AF susceptibility genes as a possible pathophysiological substrate for AF . Natriuretic peptides induce weak P50552 phosphorylation at DB00133 239 in platelets . Cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophoshate ( cGMP ) is the common second messenger for the cardiovascular effects of nitric oxide ( NO ) and natriuretic peptides ( NP ; e.g. atrial NP [ P01160 ] ) , which activate soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclases , respectively . The role of NO in regulating cGMP and platelet function is well documented , whereas there is little evidence supporting a role for NPs in regulating platelet reactivity . By studying platelet aggregation and secretion in response to a P25116 peptide , collagen and ADP , and phosphorylation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) substrate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( P50552 ) at serine 239 , we evaluated the effects of NPs in the absence or presence of the non-selective cGMP and DB02527 phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) inhibitor , DB07954 ( DB07954 ) . Our results show that NPs , possibly through the clearance receptor ( natriuretic peptide receptor-C ) expressed on platelet membranes , increase P50552 phosphorylation but only following PDE inhibition , indicating a small , localised cGMP synthesis . As platelet aggregation and secretion measured under the same conditions were not affected , we conclude that the magnitude of PKG activation achieved by NPs in platelets per se is not sufficient to exert functional inhibition of platelet involvement in haemostasis . Biological characterization of DB05037 , a small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases , in human tumor cell lines . P12004 -dependent kinases ( CDK ) , and their regulatory cyclin partners , play a central role in eukaryotic cell growth , division , and death . This key role in cell cycle progression , as well as their deregulation in several human cancers , makes them attractive therapeutic targets in oncology . A series of CDK inhibitors was developed using Astex 's fragment-based medicinal chemistry approach , linked to high-throughput X-ray crystallography . A compound from this series , designated DB05037 , is currently in early-phase clinical development . We describe here the biological characterization of DB05037 , a potent inhibitor of several CDK family members . DB05037 showed potent antiproliferative activity ( 40-940 nmol/L ) in a panel of human tumor cell lines , and the mechanism of action was shown here to be consistent with the inhibition of P06493 and P24941 in solid tumor cell lines . DB05037 caused cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in human tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth in human tumor xenograft models . Tumor regression was observed following twice daily dosing of DB05037 in the HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer xenograft models . We show that these biological effects are linked to inhibition of CDKs in vivo and that DB05037 induces tumor cell apoptosis in these xenograft models . DB05037 has an attractive biological profile for development as a clinical candidate , and the tolerability and efficacy in animal models compare favorably with other CDK inhibitors in clinical development . Studies described here formed the biological rationale for investigating the potential therapeutic benefit of DB05037 in cancer patients . DB09030 : first global approval . DB09030 [ DB09030 (®) ( US ) ] , an orally active protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) receptor antagonist , has been developed by Merck & Co for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction ( MI ) or peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . DB09030 has received its first global approval for this indication in the US . This article summarizes the milestones in the development of vorapaxar leading to this first approval for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a prior MI or PAD . DB01184 treatment for gastroparesis : demographic and pharmacogenetic characterization of clinical efficacy and side-effects . BACKGROUND : DB01184 is a useful alternative to metoclopramide for treatment of gastroparesis due to better tolerability . Effectiveness and side-effects from domperidone may be influenced by patient-related factors including polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes , drug transporters , and domperidone targets . AIMS : The aim of this study was to determine if demographic and pharmacogenetic parameters of patients receiving domperidone are associated with response to treatment or side-effects . METHODS : Patients treated with domperidone for gastroparesis provided saliva samples from which DNA was extracted . Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in seven candidate genes ( P08183 , P10635 , P14416 , P15382 , Q9Y6J6 , Q12809 , P51787 ) were used for genotyping . SNP microarrays were used to assess single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ADRA1A , P35368 , and P25100 loci . RESULTS : Forty-eight patients treated with domperidone participated in the study . DNA was successfully obtained from each patient . Age was associated with effectiveness of domperidone ( p=0.0088 ) . Genetic polymorphism in Q12809 was associated with effectiveness of domperidone ( p=0.041 ) . The efficacious dose was associated with polymorphism in P08183 gene ( p=0.0277 ) . The side-effects of domperidone were significantly associated with the SNPs in the promoter region of P25100 gene . CONCLUSIONS : Genetic characteristics associated with response to domperidone therapy included polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene P08183 , the potassium channel Q12809 gene , and α1D -- adrenoceptor P25100 gene . Age was associated with a beneficial response to domperidone . If verified in a larger population , this information might be used to help determine which patients with gastroparesis might respond to domperidone and avoid treatment in those who might develop side-effects . Vasopeptidase-activated latent ligands of the histamine receptor-1 . Whether peptidases present in vascular cells can activate prodrugs active on vascular cells has been tested with 2 potential latent ligands of the histamine H1 receptor ( P35367 ) . First , a peptide consisting of the antihistamine cetirizine ( CTZ ) condensed at the N-terminus of ε-aminocaproyl-bradykinin ( εACA-BK ) was evaluated for an antihistamine activity that could be revealed by degradation of the peptide part of the molecule . CTZ-εACA-BK had a submicromolar affinity for the BK B2 receptor ( P30411 ; IC50 of 590 nM , [(3)H]BK binding competition ) , but a non-negligible affinity for the human H1 receptor ( P35367 ; IC50 of 11 μM for [(3)H] DB06691 binding ) . In the human isolated umbilical vein , a system where both endogenous P30411 and P35367 mediate strong contractions , CTZ-εACA-BK exerted mild antagonist effects on histamine-induced contraction that were not modified by omapatrilat or by a P30411 antagonist that prevents endocytosis of the BK conjugate . Cells expressing recombinant P12821 or P30411 incubated with CTZ-εACA-BK did not release a competitor of [(3)H] DB06691 binding to H1Rs . Thus , there is no evidence that CTZ-εACA-BK can release free cetirizine in biological environments . The second prodrug was a blocked agonist , L-alanyl-histamine , potentially activated by aminopeptidase N ( P15144 ) . This compound did not compete for [(3)H] DB06691 binding to H1Rs . The human umbilical vein contractility assay responded to L-alanyl-histamine ( EC50 54.7 μM ) , but the P15144 inhibitor amastatin massively ( 17-fold ) reduced its apparent potency . Amastatin did not influence the potency of histamine as a contractile agent . One of the 2 tested latent P35367 ligands , L-alanyl-histamine , supported the feasibility of pro-drug activation by vascular ectopeptidases . Protein indicators for HaCaT cell damage induced by UVB irradiation . UVB ( 290-320 nm ) is one major risk factor of skin diseases in human . In order to provide potential protein molecules in skin cell damage and skin diseases induced by UVB irradiation , the differentially expressed proteins in human keratinocytes cell HaCaT by UVB irradiation were screened by two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis ( 2D DIGE ) combined to high performance liquid chromatography-nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC-nESI-MS/MS ) . 31 protein spots were found differentially expressed with statistical significance ( p < 0.05 ) . Sixteen and 15 protein spots were observed up-regulated and down-regulated in UVB-irradiated HaCaT , respectively . Twenty-eight unique proteins were identified by searching the MS/MS data against NCBInr database through TurboSequest Bioworks software . Among the identified 28 UVB irradiation responding protein indicators , only laminin receptor 1 ( P08865 ) , calmodulin ( P62158 ) , cathepsin D ( P07339 ) and peroxiredoxin ( Q06830 ) proteins have been reported associated with skin burn and wound healing , keratinocytes proliferation and migration and epidermal barrier repairing . Most of these targets were for the first time revealed to be associated with skin cell damage induced by UVB irradiation . Function and bioinformatics analyses of the identified protein candidates were also performed using PANTHER analysis with the aid of DAVID platform . The current work provides potential protein indicators for skin cell damage from UVB irradiation . Development and evaluation of high throughput functional assay methods for Q12809 potassium channel . Three functional hERG channel assay methods have been developed and evaluated . The methods were tested against five known hERG channel inhibitors : dofetilide , terfenadine ( Seldane ) , sertindole ( DB06144 ) , astemizole ( Hismanal ) , and cisapride ( Propulsid ) . The DiBAC4(3)-based assays were found to be the most economical but had high false-hit rates as a result of the interaction of dye with the test compounds . The membrane potential dye assay had fewer color-quenching problems but was expensive and still gave false hits . The nonradioactive Rb+ efflux assay was the most sensitive of all the assays evaluated and had the lowest false-hit rate . Lasting controversy on ranibizumab and bevacizumab . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , an important angiogenic factor that is able to stimulate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells , is the best-studied hallmark of angiogenesis . Neovascularization is a major cause of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) which is a leading cause of blindness in the elderly population . Specific molecular inhibitors of P15692 have been proved to be useful in the treatment of AMD . DB01270 and DB00112 are structurally similar to anti- P15692 drugs in the treatment of AMD . Many studies have indicated that DB01270 and DB00112 are of roughly equal short-term efficacy and safety , DB00112 is an attractive alternative to DB01270 due to its lower cost . However , only DB01270 has received Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval for the treatment of macular degeneration . More multicenter clinical trials are required to compare the relative efficacy and safety of these two drugs and some progress has been achieved . This review discusses the clinical effectiveness , safety , cost and other practical implications of DB01270 and DB00112 . Contribution of the 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor in the anti-metastatic P08118 -derived peptide DB04985 cell surface binding . PURPOSE : DB04985 is an anti-metastatic synthetic peptide with promising therapeutic efficacy against hormone-refractory prostate cancer . The characterization of the DB04985 peptide cell surface binding/internalization mechanisms and of the receptors involved remained to be explored . RESULTS : [(14)C] DB04985 cell surface binding assays showed rapid and transient kinetic profile , that was inhibited by RGD peptides , laminin , hyaluronan , and type-I collagen . RGD peptides were however unable to inhibit DB04985 intracellular uptake . Far-Western ligand binding studies enabled the identification of the 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor ( P08865 ) as a potential ligand for DB04985 . Overexpression of the recombinant P08865 indeed led to an increase in DB04985 binding but unexpectedly not to its uptake . CONCLUSIONS : Our data support the implication of laminin receptors in cell surface binding and in transducing DB04985 anti-metastatic effects , and provide a rational for targeting cancers that express high levels of such laminin receptors . Targeted deletion of Kcne2 causes gastritis cystica profunda and gastric neoplasia . Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide . Predisposing factors include achlorhydria , Helicobacter pylori infection , oxyntic atrophy and Q03403 -expressing metaplasia . In parietal cells , apical potassium channels comprising the P51787 alpha subunit and the Q9Y6J6 beta subunit provide a K(+) efflux current to facilitate gastric acid secretion by the apical H(+)K(+)ATPase . Accordingly , genetic deletion of murine Kcnq1 or Kcne2 impairs gastric acid secretion . Other evidence has suggested a role for Q9Y6J6 in human gastric cancer cell proliferation , independent of its role in gastric acidification . Here , we demonstrate that 1-year-old Kcne2(-/-) mice in a pathogen-free environment all exhibit a severe gastric preneoplastic phenotype comprising gastritis cystica profunda , 6-fold increased stomach mass , increased Ki67 and nuclear P12004 D1 expression , and Q03403 - and cytokeratin 7-expressing metaplasia . Some Kcne2(-/-) mice also exhibited pyloric polypoid adenomas extending into the duodenum , and neoplastic invasion of thin walled vessels in the sub-mucosa . Finally , analysis of human gastric cancer tissue indicated reduced parietal cell Q9Y6J6 expression . Together with previous findings , the results suggest Q9Y6J6 disruption as a possible risk factor for gastric neoplasia . Changes in urinary proximal tubule parameters in neonatal rats exposed to cadmium chloride during pregnancy . Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with physiological saline solution ( vehicle ) or cadmium chloride ( CdCl2 ) at 2.0 or 2.5 mg kg-1 on days 8 , 10 , 12 and 14 of gestation . On postnatal day ( P01160 ) 3 , 12 or 49 , the offspring were examined for 8- or 24-h urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin ( beta 2-m ) , metallothionein ( MT ) and urinary activity of three proximal tubular enzymes : gammaglutamyl transferase ( P19440 ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and O60502 ( NAG ) . Treatment with CdCl2 did not affect growth or survival of offspring . Significant decreases in the urinary excretion of P19440 , ALP and NAG were observed on P01160 3 , at both doses . Exposure to 4 x 2.5 mg kg-1 resulted in functional deficit of the proximal tubule on P01160 3 , as evidenced by the significant increase in beta 2-m . Except for a slight but significant increase of beta 2-m in 49-day-old males , all the other urinary parameters returned to control values on P01160 12 . There was no effect on MT . Results from this study show that prenatal exposure to CdCl2 can induce significant changes in the kidney biochemistry of rats in the early postnatal period . DB00160 aminotransferase homologs catalyze the glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction in peroxisomes of Arabidopsis . Plant peroxisomal glyoxylate aminotransferases play central roles within the photorespiratory pathway . Genes encoding glyoxylate aminotransferases have been isolated from several animals and microbes , but only recently have plant homologs been identified . Three Arabidopsis homologs of alanine (Ala):glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 ( Q9BYV1 ) contain a putative type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal ( PTS1 ) , but the metabolic significance of these Q9BYV1 homologs is unknown . P19440 and P36268 are Ala aminotransferase ( AlaAT ) homologs from Arabidopsis that represent another type of glyoxylate aminotransferase . These proteins are class I aminotransferases , each containing a putative PTS1 . P19440 and P36268 are members of a small family of AlaATs in Arabidopsis . When expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli , P19440 and P36268 displayed biochemical characteristics very similar to one another , and to the Arabidopsis protein purified from leaves . Four aminotransferase activities were specifically associated with P19440 and P36268 , using the substrate pairs glutamate ( DB00142 ):glyoxylate , Ala:glyoxylate , DB00142 :pyruvate , and Ala:2-oxoglutarate . P19440 and P36268 may have partially redundant functions ; transcripts of both genes were detected in many of the same tissues . Although DB00142 :glyoxylate aminotransferase ( P19440 ) activity has been observed in several locations in different plants and algae , including the cytoplasm and mitochondria , our subcellular fractionation data indicate that P19440 activity was exclusively peroxisomal in Arabidopsis . Thus , glyoxylate aminotransferase reactions in plant peroxisomes appear to be catalyzed by at least two distinct types of aminotransferases : an AGT1 homolog with serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase activity ( A.H. Liepman , L.J. Olsen [ 2001 ] Plant J 25 : 487-498 ) , and a pair of closely related , potentially redundant AlaAT homologs with P19440 activity . Structure-activity relationship studies of CNS agents -- XVII . Spiro[piperidine-4',1-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline)] as a probe defining the extended topographic model of P08908 receptors . Spiro[piperidine-4',1-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline)] ( 10 ) , its derivatives 11-15 and its analogs 16 and 17 were examined as ligands of serotonin P08908 receptors . It was shown that compounds 12 and 14 had essentially the same P08908 affinity as 1-phenylpiperazine and its rigid analog 7 , whereas there were substantial differences in the steric arrangement of their crucial pharmacophores , i.e. aromatic and protonation centers . On the basis of the existing models and using the DB04829 structure as a template , a new , extended three-point topographic model of P08908 receptors has been proposed . Role of the P08908 receptor in development of the neonatal rat brain : preliminary behavioral studies . Serotonin exerts an influence on the prenatal development of rat brain . However , later developmental times may be more applicable to the understanding of the role of serotonin in human developmental disorders . Therefore , the current study was undertaken to gain preliminary information on the postnatal effects of serotonin on rat brain development . As the P08908 receptor has been shown to be involved in much of the developmental functions of serotonin , an agonist for this receptor , 8-hydroxy-DPAT ( 8-OH-DPAT ) , was used . Neonatal rat pups at three ages ( postnatal days , PNDs ) 3-10 , 10-17 or 17-24 ) were injected daily with 1 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT and evaluated for behavioral consequences . The youngest group showed accelerated incisor eruption and eye-opening , a possible consequence of P08908 receptor interactions with epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) . Behaviorally , the animals were more anxious . Animals treated from P01160 10-17 , showed no change in craniofacial development but showed greater behavioral maturity in measures of spontaneous alternation and activity in the open field . The oldest animals ( P01160 17-24 ) showed no behavioral alterations , suggesting that this time length is beyond the critical period for serotonin 's influence in brain development . Platelet-associated anti- P08514 -IIIa autoantibodies in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura recognizing epitopes close to the ligand-binding site of glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb . Localization of epitopes for platelet-associated ( PA ) anti- P08514 -IIIa ( alpha(IIb)beta(3) ) autoantibodies in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura remains elusive . Previous studies suggest that PA antibodies recognize the tertiary structure of intact glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb-IIIa . To localize their epitopes using antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , the reactivity of 34 PA anti- P08514 -IIIa antibodies was examined with recombinant P08514 -IIIa having a defect in ligand-binding sites in either P08514 or P05106 , and no major conformational change was induced : KO variant P08514 -IIIa was attributed to a 2-amino acid insertion between residues 160 and 161 in the W3 4-1 loop in P08514 , and P62158 variant P08514 -IIIa was attributed to D119Y in P05106 . In one third ( 11 of 34 ) of the patients , PA antibodies showed a marked decrease ( less than 50 % ) in reactivity with KO compared with wild-type P08514 -IIIa . Their reactivity was also impaired against GPIIbD163A-IIIa . In sharp contrast , they reacted normally with P62158 P08514 -IIIa . OP-G2 , a ligand-mimetic monoclonal antibody , markedly inhibited their binding to P08514 -IIIa in patients with impaired binding to KO P08514 -IIIa , but small P08514 -IIIa antagonists did not . In addition , a newly developed sensitive ELISA indicated that autoantibodies showing impaired binding to KO are more potent inhibitors for fibrinogen binding . The present data suggest that certain PA anti- P08514 -IIIa autoantibodies recognize epitopes close to the ligand-binding site in P08514 , but not in P05106 . Pharmacogenomics of methadone maintenance treatment . DB00333 is the major opioid substitution therapy for opioid dependence . Dosage is highly variable and is often controlled by the patient and prescriber according to local and national policy and guidelines . Nevertheless many genetic factors have been investigated including those affecting its metabolism ( P20813 -consistent results ) , efflux transport ( P-gp-inconsistent results ) , target μ-opioid receptor ( μ-opioid receptor-inconsistent results ) and a host of other receptors ( P14416 ) and signaling elements ( P48051 and P32121 ; not replicated ) . None by themselves have been able to substantially explain dosage variation ( the major but not sole end point ) . When multiple genes have been combined such as P08183 , P20813 , P35372 and P14416 a greater contribution to dosage variation was found but not as yet replicated . As stabilization of dosage needs to be made rapidly , it is imperative that larger internationally based studies be instigated so that genetic contribution to dosage can be properly assessed , which may or may not tailor to different ethnic groups and each country 's policy towards an outcome that benefits all . Contribution of platelets and the vessel wall to the antithrombotic effects of a single bolus injection of Fab fragments of the antiplatelet P08514 /IIIa antibody 7E3 in a canine arterial eversion graft preparation . The contribution of platelets and the vessel wall to the antithrombotic effects of a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.8 mg/kg Fab fragments of the monoclonal antiplatelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antibody DB00054 ( 7E3-Fab ) , combined with continuous heparin anticoagulation ( 100 U/kg bolus and 50 U/kg per hour ) , was studied in a canine preparation consisting of an everted ( inside out ) carotid arterial segment that had been inserted into a transected femoral artery . In all 6 control dogs without antibody , persistent or transient eversion graft occlusion occurred during an initial 2-hour observation period , and 5 of the 6 grafts were occluded at 24 hours . In 6 dogs given 7E3-Fab 24 hours before receiving an everted carotid artery segment from a donor dog , cyclic occlusion and reflow occurred in all dogs , whereas the grafts were patent at the end of a 2-hour observation period in 5 of the 6 dogs ( P = .056 versus control ) . When transferred back to the donor dogs , the patient eversion segments showed brief periods of cyclic occlusion and reflow within 2 hours in 3 of 5 dogs ( P = .034 versus control ) , whereas all of the 5 eversion segments were patent at 24 hours ( P < .005 versus control ) . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Interactions between bradykinin ( BK ) and cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) expression in peptidoglycan-polysaccharide ( PG-PS ) -induced arthritis . Bradykinin ( BK ) , a vasoactive , proinflammatory nonapeptide , promotes cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) expression , leukocyte sequestration , inter-endothelial gap formation , and protein extravasation in postcapillary venules . These effects are mediated by bradykinin-1 ( P46663 ) and-2 ( P30411 ) receptors . We delineated some of the mechanisms by which BK could influence chronic inflammation by altering P62158 expression on leukocytes , endothelium , and synovium in joint sections of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide-injected Lewis rats . Blocking P46663 results in significantly increased joint inflammation . Immunohistochemistry of the P46663 antagonist group revealed increased leukocyte and synovial CD11b and CD54 expression and increased CD11b and P16070 endothelial expression . P30411 antagonism decreased leukocyte and synovial P16070 and CD54 and endothelial CD11b expression . Although these findings implicate P30411 involvement in the acute phase of inflammation by facilitating leukocyte activation ( CD11b ) , homing ( P16070 ) , and transmigration ( CD54 ) . Treatment with a P30411 antagonist did not affect the disease evolution in this model . In contrast , when both BK receptors are blocked , the aggravation of inflammation by P46663 blockade is neutralized and there is no difference from the disease-untreated model . Our findings suggest that P46663 and P30411 signaling show physiologic antagonism . P46663 signaling suggests involvement in down-regulation of leukocyte activation , transmigration , and homing . Further studies are needed to evaluate the B1 receptor agonist 's role in this model . Cardiac channelopathies associated with infantile fatal ventricular arrhythmias : from the cradle to the bench . BACKGROUND : Fatal ventricular arrhythmias in the early period of life have been associated with cardiac channelopathies for decades , and postmortem analyses in P22304 victims have provided evidence of this association . However , the prevalence and functional properties of cardiac ion channel mutations in infantile fatal arrhythmia cases are not clear . METHODS AND RESULTS : Seven infants with potentially lethal arrhythmias at age < 1 year ( 5 males , age of onset 44.1 ± 72.1 days ) were genetically analyzed for P51787 , Q12809 , P15382 -5 , P63252 , Q14524 , P36382 , and P62158 by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing . Whole-cell currents of wildtype and mutant channels were recorded and analyzed in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with Q14524 and Q12809 cDNA . In 5 of 7 patients , we identified 4 mutations ( p.N1774D , p.T290fsX53 , p.F1486del and p.N406K ) in Q14524 , and 1 mutation ( p.G628D ) in Q12809 . N1774D , F1486del , and N406K in Q14524 displayed tetrodotoxin-sensitive persistent late Na(+) currents . By contrast , Q14524 -T290fsX53 was nonfunctional . Q12809 -G628D exhibited loss of channel function . CONCLUSION : Genetic screening of 7 patients was used to demonstrate the high prevalence of cardiac channelopathies . Functional assays revealed both gain and loss of channel function in Q14524 mutations , as well as loss of function associated with the Q12809 mutation . DB00741 response to stress is associated with myocardial remodeling in salmonid fishes . Cardiac disease is frequently reported in farmed animals , and stress has been implicated as a factor for myocardial dysfunction in commercial fish rearing . DB00741 is a major stress hormone in teleosts , and this hormone has adverse effects on the myocardium . Strains of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) selected for divergent post-stress cortisol levels [ high responsive ( HR ) and low responsive ( LR ) ] have been established as a comparative model to examine how fish with contrasting stress-coping styles differ in their physiological and behavioral profiles . We show that the mean cardiosomatic index ( CSI ) of adult HR fish was 34 % higher than in LR fish , mainly because of hypertrophy of the compact myocardium . To characterize the hypertrophy as physiological or pathological , we investigated specific cardiac markers at the transcriptional level . HR hearts had higher mRNA levels of cortisol receptors ( MR , GR1 and GR2 ) , increased P53805 levels [ suggesting enhanced pro-hypertrophic nuclear factor of activated T-cell ( NFAT ) signaling ] and increased P15692 gene expression ( reflecting increased angiogenesis ) . Elevated collagen ( Col1a2 ) expression and deposition in HR hearts supported enhanced fibrosis , whereas the heart failure markers P01160 and DB04899 were not upregulated in HR hearts . To confirm our results outside the selection model , we investigated the effect of acute confinement stress in wild-type European brown trout , Salmo trutta . A positive correlation between post-stress cortisol levels and CSI was observed , supporting an association between enhanced cortisol response and myocardial remodeling . In conclusion , post-stress cortisol production correlates with myocardial remodeling , and coincides with several indicators of heart pathology , well-known from mammalian cardiology .
Inhibitory effects of vinpocetine on the progression of atherosclerosis are mediated by Akt/NF-κB dependent mechanisms in apoE-/- mice . BACKGROUND : Recent studies have found additional roles for vinpocetine , a potent phosphodiesterase type I inhibitor , in anti-proliferation and anti-inflammation of vascular smooth muscle cells and cancer cells via different mechanisms . In this study , we attempted to investigate whether vinpocetine protected against atherosclerotic development in apoE(-/-) mice and explore the underlying anti-atherogenic mechanisms in macrophages . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Vinpocetine markedly decreased atherosclerotic lesion size in apoE(-/-) mice measured by oil red O . Masson 's trichrome staining and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that vinpocetine significantly increased the thickness of fibrous cap , reduced the size of lipid-rich necrotic core and attenuated inflammation . In vitro experiments exhibited a significant decrease in monocyte adhesion treated with vinpocetine . Further , active P01375 -α , P05231 , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression induced by ox-LDL were attenuated by vinpocetine in a dose-dependent manner . Similarly , ox-LDL-induced reactive oxygen species were significantly repressed by vinpocetine . Both western blot and luciferase activity assay showed that vinpocetine inhibited the enhanced Akt , IKKα/β , IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activity induced by ox-LDL , and the inhibition of NF-κB activity was partly caused by Akt dephosphorylation . However , knockdown of Q01064 did not affect Akt , IKKα/β and IκBα phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that vinpocetine exerts anti-atherogenic effects through inhibition of monocyte adhesion , oxidative stress and inflammatory response , which are mediated by Akt/NF-κB dependent pathway but independent of PDE1 blockade in macrophages . DB08810 protects against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats : role of 5-hydroxytryptamine , prostaglandins and sulfhydryl compounds . This study was designed to determine the gastroprotective properties of cinitapride ( CNT ) , a novel prokinetic benzamide derivative agonist of Q13639 and 5-HT1 receptors and 5-HT2 antagonist , on mucosal injury produced by 50 % ( v/v ) ethanol . Results were compared with those for 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT : 10 mg kg-1 ) . The possible involvements of gastric mucus secretion , endogenous prostaglandins ( PGs ) and sulfhydryl compounds ( SH ) in the protection mediated by CNT were also examined . Intraperitoneal administration of CNT ( 0.50 and 1 mg kg-1 ) , 30 min before ethanol , significantly prevented gastric ulceration and increased the hexosamine content of gastric mucus . CNT ( 1 mg kg-1 ) also produced a significant increase in gastric mucosal levels of DB00917 , but did not induce any significant changes in SH values . On the contrary , pretreatment with 5-HT worsened ethanol-induced erosions , however , did not affect gastric mucus secretion , glycoprotein content or DB00917 levels , although the non-protein SH fraction was significantly decreased . The present results demonstrate that the gastroprotective effects of CNT could be partly explained by a complex PG dependent mechanism . We suggest that 5-HT dependent mechanisms through 5-HT2 receptor blockade and 5-HT1 receptor activation could be also involved . DB05822 , a nitric oxide-releasing aspirin derivative , exhibits a significant antiproliferative effect and alters cell cycle progression in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines . DB00435 -releasing non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NO-NSAIDs ) are safer than NSAIDs due to their ability to reduce gastric toxicity . We assessed the cytotoxic activity of a new aspirin derivative , DB05822 , after different exposure schedules , in three human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines . All the lines were positive for P23219 protein and mRNA , as evaluated by Western blot and RT-PCR , respectively , while only one was positive for P35354 . The cytostatic and cytocidal activity was determined by sulforhodamine B assay and evaluated according to Monks ' model . Cytostatic activity was observed after a 24-h drug exposure and 50 % growth inhibition was reached at concentrations ranging from 165 to 250 micro M in all cell lines , whereas with aspirin the IC50 was never reached , even at the maximum concentration tested ( 500 micro M ) , and was independent of P23219 or P35354 status . Cytocidal activity was observed only at the highest concentrations and persisted for a long time after drug removal . Flow cytometric analysis showed that the NO-aspirin compound induced a persistent accumulation of cells in G2-M phase in all the cell lines after at least 48 h exposure . Specifically , the block pertained mainly to G2 phase , whereas mitotic index was not affected at all . Our results indicate that DB05822 has an in vitro cytostatic activity superior to that of its parental aspirin compound , which makes it a potentially important tumor preventive agent . Furthermore , the cytocidal effect observed at the highest concentrations and the induction of a specific block in G2 phase renders it a promising candidate for drug combination treatments . Suppressive effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 on interferon-gamma-induced nitric oxide production in insulin-producing cells is mediated by inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production . During the development of Type 1 diabetes , inflammatory cytokines are known to induce the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) in pancreatic islets , and subsequent production of nitric oxide ( NO ) contributes to beta cell destruction . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) has been shown to reduce cytokine-induced apoptosis of beta cells . In this study , we investigated whether P0C6A0 affects cytokine-induced NO production , resulting in the inhibition of beta-cell apoptosis . We treated MIN6N8a mouse beta cells with interferon ( IFN ) -gamma in the presence or absence of P0C6A0 and found that P01579 treatment induced P35228 mRNA expression and NO production , which was significantly inhibited by treatment with P0C6A0 . Blocking of P43220 signaling via the cyclic AMP and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway did not directly affect the suppressive effect of P0C6A0 on IFN- gamma-induced P35228 mRNA expression . Further studies revealed that P01579 induced the expression of P01375 mRNA and protein , which synergistically induced NO production , and P0C6A0 treatment inhibited this induction of P01375 . To examine whether the reduction of P01375 by P0C6A0 treatment plays a role in suppressing NO production , we treated MIN6N8a cells with P01579 in the presence of anti- P01375 neutralizing antibody and found that NO production was reduced . In addition , treatment of mouse islets with P0C6A0 inhibited the expression of P35228 and TNFmRNA . These results suggest that P0C6A0 inhibits P01579 -induced NO production by suppression of P01375 production . Direct anti-inflammatory mechanisms contribute to attenuation of experimental allograft arteriosclerosis by statins . BACKGROUND : Despite the development of effective immunosuppressive therapy , transplant graft arterial disease ( Q99259 ) remains the major limitation to long-term graft survival . The interplay between host inflammatory cells and donor vascular wall cells results in an intimal hyperplastic lesion , which leads to ischemia and graft failure . P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) reduce Q99259 in human cardiac allografts , although it is unclear whether this is secondary to cholesterol lowering or other mechanisms . This study tested the hypothesis that statins can suppress Q99259 by cholesterol-independent pathways . METHODS AND RESULTS : We performed heterotopic murine cardiac transplants in total allogeneic or major histocompatibility complex class II-mismatched combinations . Transplanted animals received either control chow , chow containing 25 ppm cerivastatin ( low dose ) , or chow containing 125 ppm cerivastatin ( high dose ) . Mean plasma cerivastatin concentrations were 0.0 ( control ) , 10.1 ( low dose ) , and 21.9 ( high dose ) nmol/L , respectively . Plasma cholesterol levels were the same in all groups . Q99259 scores decreased in low-dose ( P < 0.05 ) and high-dose ( P < 0.0001 ) cerivastatin groups compared with controls , with concomitant reduction in graft-infiltrating cells and significantly decreased intragraft RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA expression . DB00439 , as well as other statins , also reduced RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production in mouse endothelial cells stimulated with interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in vitro . CONCLUSIONS : Clinically achievable levels of an P04035 inhibitor attenuate Q99259 in murine heart transplants , diminish host inflammatory cell recruitment , and do not alter cholesterol levels . These results indicate that statins can affect arterial biology and inflammation independently of their effects on cholesterol metabolism . DB09302 : Q8NBP7 inhibitor for LDL cholesterol reduction . The proof of concept that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) inhibition affects cholesterol levels was first established after the demonstration that Q8NBP7 loss-of-function mutations result in a significant drop in circulating LDL cholesterol levels . Subsequent studies revealed that Q8NBP7 binds the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain-A on the surface LDL Receptor ( P01130 ) and directs P01130 and Q8NBP7 for lysosomal degradation . DB09302 ( also known as SAR236553/REGN727 ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds circulating Q8NBP7 and blocks its interactions with surface P01130 . DB09302 clinical trials with different doses on different administration schedules were shown to significantly reduce LDL cholesterol both as a mono-therapy and in combination with statins or ezetimibe . Although there is great potential for anti- Q8NBP7 therapies in the management of cholesterol metabolism , there is no clear evidence yet that blocking Q8NBP7 reduces cardiovascular disease outcome . This is being investigated in ongoing Phase III clinical trials with alirocumab . DB08879 -- an anti- Q9Y275 human monoclonal antibody for rheumatoid arthritis . INTRODUCTION : Q9Y275 ( Q9Y275 ) is a major regulatory factor that controls the development and survival of B cells . Elevated serum levels of Q9Y275 have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . DB08879 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits Q9Y275 and it is being developed for the treatment of RA . This review aims to summarize up-to-date pharmacological and clinical data of belimumab in the treatment of RA . AREAS COVERED : A literature search was performed on PubMed using keywords , including belimumab , LymphoStat-B , benlysta , Q9Y275 inhibitor , rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disease . References of relevant studies were searched by hand . Abstracts of international conferences up to October 2012 were also included . DB08879 was well tolerated in the treatment of RA over 24 weeks . It significantly increased American College of Rheumatology ( P10323 )20 responses at week 24 , especially in patients with high disease activity , positive rheumatoid factor , no anti- P01375 treatment experience and those who had failed methotrexate therapy . However , belimumab failed to demonstrate significantly improved ACR50 and ACR70 responses in the single Phase II clinical trial of RA . EXPERT OPINION : These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of belimumab for RA needs to be further investigated in future clinical trials . Careful patient selection may be necessary for belimumab to achieve optimal clinical outcomes in RA . Monoclonal antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 , P00533 ) autocrine pathway contributes to a number of highly relevant processes in cancer development and progression , including cell proliferation , regulation of apoptotic cell death , angiogenesis and metastatic spread . The crucial role that P00533 plays in human cancers has led to an extensive search for selective inhibitors of its signaling pathway . The results of a large body of preclinical studies and clinical trials thus far conducted suggest that targeting the P00533 could bring a significant contribution to cancer therapy . A variety of different approaches are currently being used to target the P00533 . The most promising strategies in clinical development include monoclonal antibodies , to prevent ligand binding , and small molecules inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity , that inhibit autophosphorylation and downstream intracellular signaling . Several blocking monoclonal antibodies against the P00533 have been developed . Among these , IMC-225 is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody that has been the first anti- P00533 targeted therapy to enter clinical evaluation in cancer patients in Phase II and III studies , alone or in combination with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy . However , other antibodies against P00533 have demonstrated antitumor activity in several preclinical models of human cancer and are currently under investigation in the clinical setting , such as ICR62 , DB01269 and EMD72000 . This review will focus on all the preclinical data available on monoclonal antibodies engineered against the P01133 receptor . The food colorant erythrosine is a promiscuous protein-protein interaction inhibitor . Following our observation that erythrosine B ( FD & C Red No. 3 ) is a relatively potent inhibitor of the P01375 -R-TNFα and P25942 -CD154 protein-protein interactions , we investigated whether this inhibitory activity extends to any other protein-protein interactions ( PPI ) as well as whether any other approved food colors possess such inhibitory activity . We found erythrosine , a poly-iodinated xanthene dye , to be a non-specific promiscuous inhibitor of a number of PPIs within the tumor necrosis factor superfamily ( P01375 -R-TNFα , P25942 -CD154 , Q96RJ3 - Q9Y275 , Q9Y6Q6 - O14788 , OX40- P23510 , 4-1BB- P41273 ) as well as outside of it ( P01133 -R- P01133 ) with a remarkably consistent median inhibitory concentration ( IC(50) ) in the 2-20 μM ( approximately 2-20mg/L ) range . In agreement with this , erythrosine also showed cellular effects including clear cytotoxic effects around this concentration range ( IC₅₀≈50 μM ) . Among the seven FDA-approved food colorants , only erythrosine showed consistent PPI inhibitory activity in the sub-100 μM range , which might also explain ( at least partially ) why it also has the lowest approved acceptable daily intake ( ADI ) ( 0.1 mg/kg body weight/day ) . Among a number of xanthene structural analogs of erythrosine tested for activity , rose Bengal , a food colorant approved in Japan , showed similar , maybe even more pronounced , promiscuous inhibitory activity , whereas fluorescein was inactive and gallein , phloxine , and eosin were somewhat active in some of the assays . Q96RJ3 deficiency reduces the development of atherosclerosis in mice -- brief report . OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to assess the role of B-cell activating factor ( Q9Y275 ) receptor in B-cell regulation of atherosclerosis . METHODS AND RESULTS : Male P01130 -deficient mice ( Ldlr(-/-) ) were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with either wild type or Q96RJ3 ( Q96RJ3 ) -deficient bone marrow . After 4 weeks of recovery , mice were put on a high-fat diet for 6 or 8 weeks . Q96RJ3 deficiency in bone marrow cells led to a marked reduction of conventional mature B2 cells but did not affect the B1a cell subtype . This was associated with a significant reduction of dendritic cell activation and T-cell proliferation along with a reduction of IgG antibodies against malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein . In contrast , serum IgM type antibodies were preserved . Interestingly , Q96RJ3 deficiency was associated with a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion development and reduced numbers of plaque T cells . Selective Q96RJ3 deficiency on B cells led to a similar reduction in lesion size and T-cell infiltration but in contrast did not affect dendritic cell activation . CONCLUSIONS : Q96RJ3 deficiency in mice selectively alters mature B2 cell-dependent cellular and humoral immune responses and limits the development of atherosclerosis . A cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 pathway augments activation-induced cytosine deaminase expression within replicating human B cells . Within inflammatory environments , B cells encountering foreign or self-Ag can develop tertiary lymphoid tissue expressing activation-induced cytosine deaminase ( Q9GZX7 ) . Recently , this DNA-modifying enzyme was detected in nonlymphoid cells within several inflamed tissues and strongly implicated in malignant transformation . This study examines whether a cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) pathway , often linked to inflammation , influences Q9GZX7 expression in activated B lymphocytes . In this paper , we report that dividing human B cells responding to surrogate C3d-coated Ag , P05112 , and Q9Y275 express Q9GZX7 , as well as P35354 . A progressive increase in Q9GZX7 with each division was paralleled by a division-related increase in a P35354 -linked enzyme , microsomal PGE(2) synthase-1 , and the PGE(2)R , EP2 . Cells with the greatest expression of Q9GZX7 expressed the highest levels of EP2 . Although P35354 inhibitors diminished both Q9GZX7 expression and IgG class switching , exogenous PGE(2) and butaprost , a selective EP2 agonist , augmented Q9GZX7 mRNA/protein and increased the numbers of IgG(+) progeny . Despite the latter , the proportion of IgG(+) cells within viable progeny generally declined with PGE(2) supplementation . This was not due to PGE(2)-promoted differentiation to plasma cells or to greater downstream switching . Rather , because phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated levels were increased in progeny of PGE(2)-supplemented cultures , it appears more likely that PGE(2) facilitates Q9GZX7 -dependent DNA double-strand breaks that block B cell cycle progression or promote activation-induced cell death , or both . Taken together , the results suggest that a PGE(2) feed-forward mechanism for augmenting P35354 pathway proteins promotes progressively increased levels of Q9GZX7 mRNA , protein , and function . Genetics and irritable bowel syndrome : from genomics to intermediate phenotype and pharmacogenetics . PURPOSE : Familial aggregation and sibling pair studies suggest there is a genetic contribution to the development of irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . The aim of this study was to review the evidence of genetics in IBS based on genetic epidemiology , studies of association with intermediate phenotypes and pharmacogenetics . RESULTS : Genetic association studies with IBS symptom phenotype have generally provided inconsistent results for many candidate genes investigated , such as P31645 , P16520 , and P22301 . There have been no genome-wide association studies in IBS to date . Studies of associations of candidate genes with intermediate phenotypes suggest associations with pathophysiological mechanisms of motor and sensory functions ; however , these results also require replication . Pharmacogenetics studies illustrate the potential of genetics to impact on response to therapy , as observed with P31645 and responses to the 5- Q9H205 antagonist alosetron and the Q13639 agonist , tegaserod . CONCLUSIONS : While the heritable component and genetics in the complex disorder of IBS are still poorly understood , studies of the associations of spontaneous genetic variations and altered functions may provide novel insights of the mechanisms contributing to the disease . P16150 - , but not P16150 + , P22301 -producing CD1dhiCD5+ B cells suppress type 1 immune responses during Chlamydia muridarum genital tract infection . Regulatory B ( Breg ) cells are known to modulate immune responses through predominantly interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) -dependent mechanisms and can be hypothetically divided into innate and adaptive subsets based on the nature of their activating signals . However , the specific role of different Breg subsets in modulating immune responses remains ambiguous . Here we have shown that Chlamydia induces P22301 -producing splenic B-cell populations consisting of P16150 (+) and P16150 (-) subsets of IgM(hi)IgD(lo) innate-like B ( ILB ) cells in vitro . While P16150 (+) P22301 -producing B cells displayed innate type features and were readily induced by Chlamydia via Toll-like-receptor ( TLR ) signaling , P16150 (-) P22301 -producing B cells required additional B-cell activating factor ( Q9Y275 ) -mediated signals from dendritic cells ( DCs ) for their differentiation and activation , thereby classifying them as adaptive type Bregs . Importantly , P16150 (-) , but not P16150 (+) , P22301 -producing ILB cells displayed bona fide Breg activity by potently suppressing interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) production in vitro in an P22301 -dependent manner . Furthermore , a novel P16150 (-)CD1d(hi) P06127 (+) P22301 -producing Breg population was predominantly induced by Chlamydia genital infection in vivo . Correspondingly , mixed bone marrow chimeric mice with B-cell-specific P22301 deficiency exhibited significantly increased type 1 immune responses , decreased bacterial burden , and reduced oviduct pathology upon infection . Our data demonstrate for the first time a distinct role for P16150 (-)CD1d(hi) P06127 (+)-adaptive Bregs over P16150 (+) innate counterparts in controlling mucosal responses against intracellular bacterial infection . Synergistic cytotoxicity of radiation and oncolytic Lister strain vaccinia in (V600D/E) P15056 mutant melanoma depends on JNK and P01375 -α signaling . Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that carries an extremely poor prognosis when local invasion , nodal spread or systemic metastasis has occurred . Recent advances in melanoma biology have revealed that DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 signaling has a pivotal role in governing disease progression and treatment resistance . Proof-of-concept clinical studies have shown that direct P15056 inhibition yields impressive responses in advanced disease but these are short-lived as treatment resistance rapidly emerges . Therefore , there is a pressing need to develop new targeted strategies for P15056 mutant melanoma . As such , oncolytic viruses represent a promising cancer-specific approach with significant activity in melanoma . This study investigated interactions between genetically-modified vaccinia virus ( GLV-1h68 ) and radiotherapy in melanoma cell lines with P15056 mutant , Ras mutant or wild-type genotype . Preclinical studies revealed that GLV-1h68 combined with radiotherapy significantly increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis relative to either single agent in (V600D) P15056 /(V600E) P15056 mutant melanoma in vitro and in vivo . The mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity with GLV-1h68/radiation ( RT ) was independent of viral replication and due to attenuation of JNK , p38 and P29323 MAPK phosphorylation specifically in P15056 mutant cells . Further studies showed that JNK pathway inhibition sensitized P15056 mutant cells to GLV-1h68-mediated cell death , mimicking the effect of RT . GLV-1h68 infection activated MAPK signaling in (V600D) P15056 /(V600E) P15056 mutant cell lines and this was associated with P01375 -α secretion which , in turn , provided a prosurvival signal . Combination GLV-1h68/RT ( or GLV-1h68/JNK inhibition ) caused abrogation of P01375 -α secretion . These data provide a strong rationale for combining GLV-1h68 with irradiation in (V600D/E) P15056 mutant tumors . Individual cerebellar Purkinje cells express different cGMP phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) : in vivo phosphorylation of cGMP-specific PDE ( O76074 ) as an indicator of cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) activation . The nitric oxide ( NO ) -cGMP pathway has been implicated as playing a crucial role in the induction of cerebellar long-term depression ( LTD ) . The amplitude and duration of the cGMP signal is controlled by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) . Here we identify O76074 and Q01064 as the two major cGMP-hydrolyzing PDEs specifically and differentially expressed in the Purkinje neurons of mouse cerebellum . O76074 was found in all Purkinje neurons , whereas Q01064 was detected only in a subset of these cells , suggesting that individual Purkinje cells may differentially regulate cGMP , depending on the PDE isozymes expressed . Although expression of guanylate cyclase and/or cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) in Purkinje cells have been reported , neither cGMP accumulation nor PKG activation in these cells in vivo has been demonstrated . To determine if changes in PKG activation and O76074 regulation occur in vivo we have examined the phosphorylation of O76074 in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analyses using a phosphospecific O76074 antibody . Injection of sodium nitroprusside or selective PKG activators into the lateral ventricle of mouse brain induced O76074 phosphorylation in vivo , but was completely missing in Purkinje cell-specific PKG I knock-out mice . In cerebellar slices , treatment with sildenafil or DB07954 led to different levels of phospho- O76074 accumulation and activation of O76074 . These results suggest that phosphorylation of O76074 in Purkinje neurons after cGMP-PKG activation performs a critical role in the termination of the cGMP signal during LTD progression ; moreover , O76074 phosphorylation may be used as an in vivo indicator for PKG activation . An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , eserine , induces long-term depression at P07451 - P00915 synapses in the hippocampus of adult rats . Studies in humans and rodents support a role for muscarinic ACh receptor ( mAChR ) and nicotinic AChR in learning and memory , and both regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity using complex and often times opposing mechanisms . P22303 ( P22303 ) inhibitors are commonly prescribed to enhance cholinergic signaling in Alzheimer 's disease in hopes of rescuing cognitive function , caused , in part , by degeneration of cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus and cortex . Unfortunately , therapeutic efficacy is moderate and inconsistent , perhaps due to unanticipated mechanisms . M1 mAChRs bidirectionally control synaptic strength at P07451 - P00915 synapses ; weak pharmacological activation using carbachol ( CCh ) facilitates potentiation , whereas strong agonism induces muscarinic long-term depression ( mLTD ) via an P29323 -dependent mechanism . Here , we tested the prediction that accumulation of extracellular ACh via inhibition of P22303 is sufficient to induce LTD at P07451 - P00915 synapses in hippocampal slices from adult rats . Although P22303 inhibition with eserine induces LTD , it unexpectedly does not share properties with mLTD induced by CCh , as reported previously . DB00981 -LTD was prevented by the M3 mAChR-preferring antagonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide ( 4-DAMP ) , and pharmacological inhibition of MEK was completely ineffective . Additionally , pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK prevents mLTD but has no effect on eserine-LTD . Finally , long-term expression of eserine-LTD is partially dependent on a decrease in presynaptic release probability , likely caused by tonic activation of mAChRs by the sustained increase in extracellular ACh . Thus these findings extend current literature by showing that pharmacological P22303 inhibition causes a prolonged decrease in presynaptic glutamate release at P07451 - P00915 synapses , in addition to inducing a likely postsynaptic form of LTD . Clinical pharmacology of albiglutide , a P43220 agonist . DB09043 is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue composed of tandem copies of modified human glucagon-like peptide-1 ( 7-36 ) coupled to recombinant human albumin that is approved in adults for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus . After subcutaneous administration , albiglutide is likely primarily absorbed via the lymphatic circulation , with maximum concentrations being reached in 3 to 5 days ; steady-state exposures are achieved following approximately 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration . The elimination half-life of albiglutide is approximately 5 days . Clearance of albiglutide is 67 mL/h with between-subject variability of 34.9 % ; no covariates have been identified that would require dose adjustment of albiglutide . DB09043 lowers the fasting plasma glucose and reduces postprandial glucose excursions . In addition , β-cell secretion is enhanced by albiglutide during hyperglycemia , whereas secretion is suppressed during hypoglycemia ; α-cell response to hypoglycemia is not impaired by albiglutide . DB09043 does not prolong the corrected QT interval but has a modest effect on heart rate in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Dose adjustment is not suggested in patients with renal impairment , but experience in patients with severe renal impairment is very limited , and it is recommended that albiglutide be used with care in such patients due to an increased frequency of diarrhea , nausea , and vomiting . No clinically relevant drug interactions have been observed in clinical trials .

DB08881 response in 2 patients with posttransplant refractory P15056 V600E-mutated multiple myeloma . Protease-resistant human Q99259 -derived altered peptide ligands decrease P01375 and Q16552 production in peripheral blood cells from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus . DB00142 decarboxylase 65 ( Q99259 ) and proinsulin are major diabetes-associated autoantigens that drive autoreactive T cells . Altered peptide ligands ( APL ) have been proposed as reagents for the modification of autoimmune reactions . Here , we have prepared Q99259 -derived protease-resistant APL ( prAPL ) by cleavage site-directed modification . The resulting prAPL are resistant to lysosomal and serum proteases , bind with high-affinity to HLA- Q8IUH3 (*)0401 and have a prolonged half-life in the serum . Q99259 -derived prAPL significantly decreased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by a Q99259 -specific human T cell clone . Likewise , the production of Q16552 , P01375 , and secretion of P05231 by peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ) was reduced , when stimulated with both Q99259 and Q99259 -derived prAPL . Thus , prAPL with high affinity for HLA- Q8IUH3 (*)0401 mitigate the response of Q99259 -reactive human Th17 cells . The strategy of designing specific immunomodulatory protease-resistant altered peptide ligands provides the basis for novel avenues of therapeutic intervention . The Q9Y275 /APRIL system : emerging functions beyond B cell biology and autoimmunity . The Q9Y275 system plays a key role in the development of autoimmunity , especially in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . This often leads to the assumption that Q9Y275 is mostly a B cell factor with a specific role in autoimmunity . Focus on Q9Y275 and autoimmunity , driven by pharmaceutical successes with the recent approval of a novel targeted therapy DB08879 , has relegated other potential roles of Q9Y275 to the background . Far from being SLE-specific , the Q9Y275 system has a much broader relevance in infection , cancer and allergy . In this review , we provide the latest views on additional roles of the Q9Y275 system in health and diseases , as well as an update on Q9Y275 and autoimmunity , with particular focus on current clinical trials . APRIL and Q9Y275 proteins increase proliferation of human adipose-derived stem cells through activation of Erk1/2 Q96HU1 kinase . Human adipose-derived stem cells ( Q9ULZ3 ) are DB05914 with reduced immunogenicity and the ability to modulate immune responses . APRIL and Q9Y275 proteins are overexpressed in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases for which allogeneic Q9ULZ3 therapy is currently under clinical investigation . Modification of Q9ULZ3 properties by the tissue microenvironment could be a critical factor in patient outcome and is still not well understood . Our aim was to characterize the APRIL/ Q9Y275 system in Q9ULZ3 by analyzing the ligand and receptor expression patterns , the effects mediated by APRIL and Q9Y275 on Q9ULZ3 , and the underlying signaling . We found that Q9ULZ3 express the tumor necrosis factor proteins APRIL ( a proliferation-inducing ligand ) and Q9Y275 ( B cell-activator factor ) as well as their receptors O14836 ( transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor ) , Q02223 ( B cell maturation antigen ) and the Q9Y275 -specific receptor ( Q96RJ3 ) . APRIL and Q9Y275 secretion was differentially enhanced by P48061 and interferon ( IFN ) -γ , implicated in Q9ULZ3 -mediated migration and immunosuppression , respectively . In addition , APRIL and Q9Y275 induced rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) and Akt kinases and promoted an increase in Q9ULZ3 proliferation , without affecting the immunosuppressive capacity of these cells . The use of specific chemical inhibitors indicated that the PI3K transduction pathway is involved in Q9ULZ3 basal growth and that APRIL- and Q9Y275 -mediated effects are P29323 -dependent . These results provide new information about the molecular mechanisms that underlie APRIL and Q9Y275 secretion and signaling in Q9ULZ3 , and are of special relevance for the use of allogeneic Q9ULZ3 as therapeutic tools .
Platelets trigger a P25942 -dependent inflammatory response in the microvasculature of inflammatory bowel disease patients . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Platelets circulate in an activated state in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) , but their role in the pathogenesis of Q9UKU7 is unclear . The recent demonstration that activated platelets express P29965 ( L ) provides a mechanism of interaction with P25942 -positive endothelial cells , inducing them to produce proinflammatory mediators . We investigated whether platelets from patients with Q9UKU7 express enhanced levels of P29965 and induce human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells ( HIMEC ) to up-regulate cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) expression and secrete chemokines . METHODS : P29965 expression was assessed in resting and thrombin-activated platelets by flow cytometry and in mucosal microthrombi by confocal microscopy . Platelet-HIMEC cocultures were used to study P62158 up-regulation , and interleukin ( IL ) -8 and RANTES production by HIMEC . RESULTS : Q9UKU7 platelets expressed significantly higher P29965 levels than those of healthy subjects , and P29965 -positive platelets were detected in Q9UKU7 -involved mucosa . Activated platelets up-regulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 as well as production of interleukin 8 by HIMEC in a P25942 -dependent fashion . High levels of RANTES were present in platelet-HIMEC cocultures and platelets were identified as the source of this chemokine , which mediated T-cell adhesion to HIMEC . CONCLUSIONS : These results show that platelets can actively contribute to mucosal inflammation and represent a previously unrecognized component of Q9UKU7 pathogenesis . Nearly Complete Response of Brain Metastases from P04626 Overexpressing Breast Cancer with DB01259 and DB01101 after Whole Brain Irradiation . DB00072 treatment does not prevent intracranial seeding and is largely ineffective for established central nervous system metastasis in P04626 overexpressing breast cancer patients . Combination therapy of lapatinib and capecitabine may be an effective treatment option for brain metastasis of P04626 -positive breast cancer . We report a patient with breast cancer overexpressing HER-2 where brain metastases were successfully treated with radiation and a combination of lapatinib and capecitabine . Polymorphisms in inflammatory cytokines and Fcgamma receptors in childhood chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura : a pilot study . Inflammatory cytokines and low-affinity Fcgamma receptor ( FcgammaR ) polymorphisms were investigated in 37 children with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( cITP ) and 218 controls . Genotype analysis included common variants in the regulatory regions of cytokines , P01375 , P01374 , P18510 , P01583 , P01584 , P05112 , P05231 and P22301 , and structural variants of the low affinity FcgammaRs , P12318 , P08637 and O75015 . Associations were observed for P01375 ( P = 0.0032 ) , P01374 ( P = 0.019 ) , P08637 ( P = 0.038 ) and O75015 ( P = 0.0034 ) . Two combinations of genotypes ( P01375 and P08637 ; P = 0.0003 , and P01374 and O75015 ; P = 0.011 ) were significantly associated with cITP . These results provide preliminary evidence that variant genotypes of FcgammaRs and cytokines contribute to cITP pathogenesis . Synthesis and evaluation of ( S ) -2-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)-4- ( [ 3-methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butyl-carbamoyl ] -methyl ) -benzoic acid ( [18F]repaglinide ) : a promising radioligand for quantification of pancreatic beta-cell mass with positron emission tomography ( PET ) . 18F-labeled non-sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent ( S ) -2-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy)-4- ( ( 3-methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butylcarbamoyl ) -methyl ) -benzoic acid ( [(18)F]repaglinide ) , a derivative of the sulfonylurea-receptor ( Q09428 ) ligand repaglinide , was synthesized as a potential tracer for the non-invasive investigation of the sulfonylurea 1 receptor status of pancreatic beta-cells by positron emission tomography ( PET ) in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes . [(18)F] DB00912 could be obtained in an overall radiochemical yield ( RCY ) of 20 % after 135 min with a radiochemical purity higher than 98 % applying the secondary labeling precursor 2-[(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate . Specific activity was in the range of 50-60 GBq/micromol . Labeling was conducted by exchanging the ethoxy-moiety into a 2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy group . To characterize the properties of fluorinated repaglinide , the affinity of the analogous non-radioactive (19)F-compound for binding to the human Q09428 isoform was assessed . [(19)F] DB00912 induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a Hill coefficient close to 1 ( 1.03 ) yielding a dissociation constant ( K(D) ) of 134 nM . Biological activity was proven via insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat islets and was comparable to that of repaglinide . Finally , biodistribution of [(18)F]repaglinide was investigated in rats by measuring the concentration of the compound in different organs after i.v. injection . Pancreatic tissue displayed a stable accumulation of approximately 0.12 % of the injected dose from 10 min to 30 min p.i . 50 % of the radioactive tracer could be displaced by additional injection of unlabeled repaglinide , indicating that [(18)F]repaglinide might be suitable for in vivo investigation with PET . Altered gene expression by low-dose arsenic exposure in humans and cultured cardiomyocytes : assessment by real-time PCR arrays . Chronic arsenic exposure results in higher risk of skin , lung , and bladder cancer , as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes . The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects on expression of selected genes in the blood lymphocytes from 159 people exposed chronically to arsenic in their drinking water using a novel RT-PCR TaqMan low-density array ( TLDA ) . We found that expression of tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) , which activates both inflammation and NF-κB-dependent survival pathways , was strongly associated with water and urinary arsenic levels . Expression of P22460 , which encodes a potassium ion channel protein , was positively associated with water and toe nail arsenic levels . Expression of 2 and 11 genes were positively associated with nail and urinary arsenic , respectively . Because arsenic exposure has been reported to be associated with long QT intervals and vascular disease in humans , we also used this TLDA for analysis of gene expression in human cardiomyocytes exposed to arsenic in vitro . Expression of the ion-channel genes CACNA1 , Q12809 , P51787 and P15382 were down-regulated by 1-μM arsenic . Alteration of some common pathways , including those involved in oxidative stress , inflammatory signaling , and ion-channel function , may underlay the seemingly disparate array of arsenic-associated diseases , such as cancer , cardiovascular disease , and diabetes . Differences in transcript levels of ABC transporters between pancreatic adenocarcinoma and nonneoplastic tissues . OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to evaluate transcript levels of all 49 human DB00171 -binding cassette transporters ( ABCs ) in one of the most drug-resistant cancers , namely , the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) . Association of ABCs levels with clinical-pathologic characteristics and P01116 mutation status was followed as well . METHODS : Tumors and adjacent nonneoplastic tissues were obtained from 32 histologically verified PDAC patients . The transcript profile of ABCs was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with a relative standard curve . P01116 mutations in exon 2 were assessed by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing . RESULTS : Most ABCs were deregulated in PDAC and 10 ABCs were associated with clinical-pathologic characteristics . P01116 mutations did not change the global expression profile of ABCs . CONCLUSIONS : The expression of ABC transporters was significantly deregulated in PDAC tumors when compared to nonmalignant tissues . The observed up-regulation of P21439 , O95342 , P33527 , O15438 , O15440 , Q5T3U5 , and Q9UNQ0 in tumors may contribute to the generally poor treatment response of PDAC . The up-regulation of O95477 , Q8IZY2 , and P45844 implicates a serious impairment of cellular cholesterol homeostasis in PDAC . On the other hand , the observed down-regulation of Q99758 , O95255 , P13569 , and Q09428 suggests a possible role of stem cells in the development and progression of PDAC . DB00073 -dependent cytotoxicity by natural killer cells : influence of P08637 polymorphism on the concentration-effect relationship . The P08637 gene dimorphism generates two allotypes : FcgammaRIIIa-158V and FcgammaRIIIa-158F . The genotype homozygous for FcgammaRIIIa-158V ( VV ) is associated with higher clinical response to rituximab , a chimeric anti- P11836 IgG1 used in the treatment of B lymphoproliferative malignancies . Our objective was to determine whether this genetic association relates to rituximab-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by FcgammaRIIIa/CD16a+ cells . The number of CD16+ circulating monocytes , T cells , and natural killer ( NK ) cells in 54 donors was first shown to be unrelated to P08637 polymorphism . We then demonstrated that FcgammaRIIIa-158V displays higher affinity for rituximab than FcgammaRIIIa-158F by comparing rituximab concentrations inhibiting the binding of 3G8 mAb ( anti-CD16 ) with VV NK cells and NK cells homozygous for FcgammaRIIIa-158F ( FF ) . VV and FF NK cells killed Daudi cells similarly after FcgammaRIIIa engagement by saturating concentrations of rituximab or 3G8 . However , the rituximab concentration resulting in 50 % lysis ( EC(50) ) observed with NK cells from VV donors was 4.2 times lower than that observed with NK cells from FF donors ( on average 0.00096 and 0.00402 microg/ml , respectively , P = 0.0043 ) . Finally , the functional difference between VV and FF NK cells was restricted to rituximab concentrations weakly sensitizing P11836 . This study supports the conclusion that P08637 genotype is associated with response to rituximab because it affects the relationship between rituximab concentration and NK cell-mediated lysis of P11836 + cells . DB00073 administration could therefore be adjusted according to P08637 genotype . P23458 / P40763 activation directly inhibits IL-12 production in dendritic cells by preventing P50750 /P-TEFb recruitment to the p35 promoter . Inhibition of Janus-activated kinase-1 ( P23458 ) is a promising clinical concept for post-transplant immunosuppression and autoimmunity . However , it also raises concerns regarding possible immunosuppressive side effects . Our study investigates P23458 signalling in the context of P29965 and bacterially activated human MoDC using siRNA and biological inhibitors . We demonstrate that strong stimuli ( e.g. intact Escherichia coli or LPS in addition to IL-1β ) induce IL-12p70 via a ROS/ Q04206 / P50750 pathway that is inhibited by simultaneous P23458 / P40763 signalling . Transcription is effective if Q04206 recruits the positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb ) component P50750 to a combined Q04206 / P40763 binding site -50 to -20bp upstream of the start site of the IL-12p35 promoter . P40763 simultaneously attaches to this site and inhibits P50750 binding . In the presence of IFNγ , P23458 /2 inhibitors block P42224 / P10914 / Q02556 -dependent activation and simultaneously enhance P50750 -dependent activation signals . This inverse regulation of IFNγ- vs. E. coli-induced cytokine production by JAK inhibitors including DB08877 was similarly observed for P05231 and P01375 -α production , but not for P22301 production . Thus , P23458 inhibition enhances IL-12p70 production in this context by increased DNA binding of P50750 . In contrast , weak Q04206 -activation signals ( P29965 , LPS ) depended on IFN-γ induced P42224 / P10914 / Q02556 co-signalling , which was completely blocked by JAK inhibitors as reported before . Our results suggest a novel molecular mechanism of how cytokine responses to invading pathogens are separable from IFNγ-dependent autoimmunity by targeting P23458 / P40763 activation . DB01296 sulfate inhibits P01375 and P01579 -induced production of P05362 in human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro . PURPOSE : DB01296 sulfate ( GS ) is a naturally occurring sugar that possesses some immunosuppressive effects in vitro and in vivo , but its mechanism is unknown . We investigated whether GS could modulate the proinflammatory cytokine-induced expression of the gene for intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 , an inflammatory protein in human retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells . METHODS : ARPE-19 cells were used as a model to determine the effects of GS on the expression of the P05362 gene upregulated by P01375 or P01579 , by Western blot analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . The activation and nuclear translocation of the nuclear factors NF-kappaB and P42224 were evaluated by immunocytochemistry , Western blot analysis , and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) . RESULTS : Both P01375 and P01579 increased the expression of P05362 at the mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner in ARPE-19 cells . GS effectively downregulated the P01375 - or P01579 -induced expression of P05362 in the protein and mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner . GS further inhibited the nuclear translocation of p65 proteins in P01375 and phosphorylated P42224 in P01579 -stimulated ARPE-19 cells . CONCLUSIONS : GS inhibits the expression of the P05362 gene in ARPE-19 cell stimulated with P01375 or P01579 through blockade of NF-kappaB subunit p65 and nuclear translocation of P42224 . This study has demonstrated a potentially important property of GS in reducing P05362 mediated inflammatory mechanisms in the eye . TTSS2-deficient hha mutant of Salmonella Typhimurium exhibits significant systemic attenuation in immunocompromised hosts . Non-typhoidal Salmonella ( P30990 ) infections are emerging as leading problem worldwide and the variations in host immune status append to the concern of P30990 . Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the causative agents of P30990 infections and has been extensively studied . The inactivation of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) encoded type-III secretion system 2 ( TTSS2 ) has been reported rendering the strain incapable for systemic dissemination to host sites and has also been proposed as live-attenuated vaccine . However , infections from TTSS2-deficient Salmonella have also been reported . In this study , mutant strain MT15 was developed by inactivation of the hemolysin expression modulating protein ( hha ) in TTSS2-deficient S. Typhimurium background . The MT15 strain showed significant level of attenuation in immune-deprived murine colitis model when tested in iNos(-/-) , P22301 (-/-) , and P29965 (-/-) mice groups in C57BL/6 background . Further , the mutation in hha does not implicate any defect in bacterial colonization to the host gut . The long-term infection of developed mutant strain conferred protective immune responses to suitably immunized streptomycin pre-treated C57BL/6 mice . The immunization enhanced the P01730 (+) and CD8(+) cell types involved in bacterial clearance . The serum IgG and luminal secretory IgA ( sIgA ) was also found to be elevated after the due course of infection . Additionally , the immunized C57BL/6 mice were protected from the subsequent lethal infection of Salmonella Typhimurium . Collectively , these findings implicate the involvement of hemolysin expression modulating protein ( Hha ) in establishment of bacterial infection . In light of the observed attenuation of the developed mutant strain , this study proposes the possible significance of SPI2-deficient hha mutant as an alternative live-attenuated vaccine strain for use against lethal Salmonella infections . Stage-dependent inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum by potent Ca2+ and calmodulin modulators . The effects of Ca2+ channel blockers , verapamil , nicardipine and diltiazem , and of potent calmodulin ( P62158 ) inhibitors , trifluoperazine ( Q9HCM9 ) , calmidazolium , W-7 and W-5 , on Plasmodium falciparum in culture were examined . Among Ca2+ blockers , nicardipine was the most potent with the 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) of 4.3 microM at 72 h after culture . Parasites were more sensitive to calmidazolium and W-7 with IC50 of 3.4 and 4.5 microM , respectively , than to Q9HCM9 and W-5 . All Ca2+ blockers and P62158 inhibitors suppressed parasite development at later stages . DB00622 , diltiazem , calmidazolium and W-5 also retarded parasite development at earlier stages and/or subsequent growth following pretreatment . Verapamil , nicardipine , Q9HCM9 and calmidazolium reduced erythrocyte invasion by merozoites . Fluorescence microscopy with the cationic fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 revealed that nicardipine , Q9HCM9 and calmidazolium depolarized both the plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane potentials of the parasite . It is therefore considered that although all Ca2+ and P62158 antagonists tested here influence parasite development at later stages , they are multifunctional , having effects not directly associated with Ca2+ channels or P62158 . Systems pharmacology assessment of the 5-fluorouracil pathway . AIM : To assess the impact of the 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) drug-pathway genes on cytotoxicity , and determine whether loss-of-function analyses coupled with functional assays can help prioritize pharmacogenomic candidate genes . MATERIALS & METHODS : Dose-response experiments were used to quantify the phenotype of sensitivity to DB00544 following the specific knockdown of genes selected from the DB00544 PharmGKB drug pathway in three human colorectal cell lines . Changes in sensitivity were considered significant if the IC(50) for shRNA-exposed cells were three standard deviations outside the mean IC(50) for control-treated cells . RESULTS : Of the 24 genes analyzed , 13 produced significant changes on the phenotype of sensitivity to DB00544 ( P00374 , Q14117 , P23919 , P33316 , Q05932 , Q92820 , P15531 , Q8TCD5 , P23921 , P04818 , Q9BZX2 , P13051 and P11172 ) . CONCLUSION : The RNAi screening strategy enabled prioritization of the genes from the DB00544 drug pathway . Further validation of the genes credentialed in this study should include gene activity or expression and mutation analyses of clinical samples . P12318 polymorphism is correlated with clinical outcome after immunotherapy of neuroblastoma with anti-GD2 antibody and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor . PURPOSE : Anti-GD2 murine IgG3 antibody 3F8 kills neuroblastoma cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) enhances phagocyte-mediated ADCC . The differential affinity of the human FCGR polymorphic alleles for 3F8 may influence the effectiveness of antibody immunotherapy . PATIENTS AND METHODS : The entire cohort of high risk neuroblastoma patients ( N = 136 ) treated on protocol using 3F8 and GM- P04141 were the subjects of this analysis . Tumor response was measured by standard clinical tools plus sensitive molecular monitoring using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) . Polymorphic alleles of P12318 and P08637 were determined by PCR plus direct sequencing using genomic DNA samples obtained from marrow or blood of patients . RESULTS : P12318 ( R/R ) genotype correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort ( P = .049 ) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse ( P = .023 ) . P12318 ( R/R ) also correlated with marrow remission 2.5 months after treatment initiation : by histology ( P = .021 and P = .036 , for the entire cohort and the subset , respectively ) and by qRT-PCR ( P = .052 and P = .033 , respectively ) . CONCLUSION : The favorable outcome associated with P12318 ( R/R ) genotype is consistent with the proposed role of P12318 and phagocyte-mediated ADCC in 3F8 plus GM- P04141 immunotherapy . Molecular predictors of combination targeted therapies ( cetuximab , bevacizumab ) in irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer ( BOND-2 study ) . BACKGROUND : To test whether intratumoral gene expression levels and germline polymorphisms predict clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) patients treated with cetuximab and bevacizumab plus irinotecan ( CBI ) vs. cetuximab and bevacizumab ( CB ) (BOND2) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Genomic DNA was extracted for genotyping from 65 patients ( 31 : CBI arm and 34 : CB arm ) . Thirty five patients had tissue samples available for the gene expression assay ( 18 : CBI arm and 17 : CB arm ) . RESULTS : High intratumoral gene expression levels of P00533 , P35968 and NRP1 were associated with longer overall survival ( OS ) in patients receiving combined monoclonal antibodies with or without irinotecan . P08637 V158F , CyclinD1 A870G and P00533 R497K polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome in patients received combined cetuximab and bevacizumab . CONCLUSIONS : Intratumoral gene expression levels of P00533 , P35968 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in P08637 , CyclinD1 and P00533 could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2 , independent of P01116 mutation status . Association of the P08637 -158F/V gene polymorphism with the response to rituximab treatment in Spanish systemic autoimmune disease patients . DB00073 is being used as treatment for systemic autoimmune diseases . The objective of this study was to determine whether the genetic variant in the Fc gamma-receptor III a ( P08637 ) gene , 158F/V , contributes to the observed variation in response to rituximab in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases . DNA samples from 132 Spanish patients with different systemic autoimmune diseases receiving rituximab were genotyped for P08637 -158F/V ( rs396991 ) gene polymorphism using the TaqMan(®) allelic discrimination technology . Six months after infusion with rituximab we evaluated the response to the drug : 61 % of the patients showed a complete response , partial 27 % and 12 % did not respond to the treatment . A statistically significant difference was observed in V allele frequency between responder ( 38 % ) and nonresponder ( 16 % ) patients ( p=0.01 ; odds ratio [OR]=3.24 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.17-11.1 ) . DB00073 was also more effective in V allele carriers ( 94 % ) than in homozygous FF patients ( 81 % ) : p=0.02 ; OR=3.96 , 95 % CI 1.10-17.68 . These results suggest that P08637 -158F/V ( rs396991 ) gene polymorphism play a role in the response to rituximab in autoimmune diseases . Validation of these findings in independent cohorts is warranted . T lymphocytes expressing a CD16 signaling receptor exert antibody-dependent cancer cell killing . To expand applications for T-cell-based immunotherapy in cancer , we designed a receptor that binds the Fc portion of human immunoglobulins and delivers activation signals . The construct included the high-affinity CD16 ( P08637 ) V158 variant , CD8α hinge , and transmembrane domains , along with signaling domains from CD3ζ and 4-1BB ( Q07011 ) , forming a chimeric receptor termed CD16V-BB-ζ . After retrovirus-mediated expression in human T cells , CD16V-BB-ζ bound humanized antibodies with higher affinity than a control receptor containing the more common F158 variant . Engagement of CD16V-BB-ζ provoked T-cell activation , exocytosis of lytic granules , and sustained proliferation , with a mean cell recovery after 4-week coculture with Daudi lymphoma cells and rituximab of nearly 70-fold relative to input cells . In contrast , unbound antibody alone produced no effect . CD16V-BB-ζ T cells specifically killed lymphoma cells and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in combination with rituximab at a low effector:target ratio , even when assayed on mesenchymal cells . DB00072 triggered CD16V-BB-ζ-mediated killing of P04626 ( P04626 ) (+) breast and gastric cancer cells ; similar results were obtained with an anti-GD2 antibody in neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma cells . Furthermore , coadministration of CD16V-BB-ζ T cells with immunotherapeutic antibodies exerted considerable antitumor activity in vivo . Signaling mediated by 4-1BB-CD3ζ induced higher T-cell activation , proliferation , and cytotoxicity than CD3ζ or FcεRIγ , and the receptor was expressed effectively after mRNA electroporation without viral vectors , facilitating clinical translation . Our results offer preclinical proof of concept for CD16V-BB-ζ as a universal , next-generation chimeric receptor with the potential to augment the efficacy of antibody therapies for cancer . P08637 -158 polymorphism influences the biological response to infliximab in Crohn 's disease through affecting the ADCC activity . An association between P08637 -158 V/F polymorphism and biological responses to infliximab has been reported in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) in Western countries . However , little is known about the mechanism by which gene polymorphism affects the responses to infliximab . The aims of this study were to confirm the association in Japanese CD patients and to reveal the effect of gene polymorphism on biological responses to infliximab . Japanese CD patients were examined retrospectively at weeks 8 and 30 . Clinical and biological responses were assessed by the Crohn 's disease activity index and P02741 levels , respectively . The infliximab-binding affinity of natural killer ( NK ) cells from P08637 -158 V/V , V/F and F/F donors was examined . DB00065 -mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) activities were also determined using transmembrane P01375 -α-expressing Jurkat T cells as target cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) from V/V , V/F and F/F donors as effector cells . Biological responses at week 8 were statistically higher in V/V patients , whereas no significant differences were observed in either clinical responses at weeks 8 and 30 or biological responses at week 30 among the three genotypes . NK cells and PBMCs from V/V patients also showed higher infliximab-binding affinity and infliximab-mediated ADCC activity , respectively . Our results suggest that P08637 -158 polymorphism is a predicting factor of biological responses to infliximab in the early phases . P08637 -158 polymorphism was also found to affect the infliximab-binding affinity of NK cells and infliximab-mediated ADCC activity in vitro , suggesting that an effect on ADCC activity influences biological responses to infliximab in CD patients . Effect of acetazolamide on aquaporin-1 and fluid flow in cultured choroid plexus . DB00819 ( AZA ) , used in treatment of early or infantile hydrocephalus , is effective in some cases , while its effect on the choroid plexus ( CP ) remains ill-defined . The drug reversibly inhibits aquaporin-4 ( P55087 ) , the most ubiquitous " water pore " in the brain , and perhaps modulation of P29972 ( located apically on CP cells ) by AZA may reduce cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) production . We sought to elucidate the effect of AZA on P29972 and fluid flow in CP cell cultures.CP tissue culture from 10-day Sprague-Dawley rats and a TRCSF-B cell line were grown on Transwell permeable supports and treated with 100 μM AZA . Fluid assays to assess direction and extent of fluid flow , and P29972 expression patterns by immunoblot , Immuncytochemistry ( ICC ) , and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) were performed.Immunoblots and ICC analyses showed a decrease in P29972 protein shortly after AZA treatment ( lowest at 12 h ) , with transient P29972 reduction mediated by mRNA expression ( lowest at 6 h ) . Transwell fluid assays indicated a fluid shift at 2 h , before significant changes in P29972 mRNA or protein levels.Timing of AZA effect on P29972 suggests the drug alters protein transcription , while affecting fluid flow by a concomitant method . It is plausible that other mechanisms account for these phenomena , as the processes may occur independently . Central opioid inhibition of neuroendocrine stress responses in pregnancy in the rat is induced by the neurosteroid allopregnanolone . The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis is the major neuroendocrine stress response system . P06850 ( P06850 ) neurons in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus ( pPVN ) play a key role in coordinating responses of this system to stressors . The cytokine interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) , mimicking infection , robustly activates these P06850 neurons via a noradrenergic input arising from the nucleus tractus solitarii ( P30990 ) . In late pregnancy , Q9Y251 axis responses to stressors , including IL-1beta , are attenuated by a central opioid mechanism that auto-inhibits noradrenaline release in the PVN . Here we show that the neuroactive progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone induces these changes in Q9Y251 responsiveness to IL-1beta in pregnancy . In late pregnancy , inhibition of 5alpha-reductase ( an allopregnanolone-synthesizing enzyme ) with finasteride restored Q9Y251 axis responses ( rapidly increased pPVN P06850 mRNA expression , DB01285 , and corticosterone secretion ) to IL-1beta . Conversely , allopregnanolone reduced Q9Y251 responses in virgin rats . In late pregnancy , activity of the allopregnanolone-synthesizing enzymes ( 5alpha-reductase and 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ) was increased in the hypothalamus as was mRNA expression in the P30990 and PVN . Naloxone , an opioid antagonist , restores Q9Y251 axis responses to IL-1beta in pregnancy but had no additional effect after finasteride , indicating a causal connection between allopregnanolone and the endogenous opioid mechanism . Indeed , allopregnanolone induced opioid inhibition over Q9Y251 responses to IL-1beta in virgin rats . Furthermore , in virgin rats , allopregnanolone treatment increased , whereas in pregnant rats finasteride decreased proenkephalin-A mRNA expression in the P30990 . Thus , in pregnancy , allopregnanolone induces opioid inhibition over Q9Y251 axis responses to immune challenge . This novel opioid-mediated mechanism of allopregnanolone action may alter regulation of other brain systems in pregnancy . Development and evaluation of high throughput functional assay methods for Q12809 potassium channel . Three functional hERG channel assay methods have been developed and evaluated . The methods were tested against five known hERG channel inhibitors : dofetilide , terfenadine ( Seldane ) , sertindole ( DB06144 ) , astemizole ( Hismanal ) , and cisapride ( Propulsid ) . The DiBAC4(3)-based assays were found to be the most economical but had high false-hit rates as a result of the interaction of dye with the test compounds . The membrane potential dye assay had fewer color-quenching problems but was expensive and still gave false hits . The nonradioactive Rb+ efflux assay was the most sensitive of all the assays evaluated and had the lowest false-hit rate . Metabolism of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by human cytochromes P450 2D6 and 3A4 . DB00734 is a relatively new antipsychotic drug that has been reported to improve both the positive and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and produces relatively few extrapyramidal side effects at low doses . Formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone , an active metabolite , is the most important metabolic pathway of risperidone in human . In the present study , in vitro metabolism of risperidone ( 100 microM ) was investigated using the recombinant human cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes P04798 , P05177 , P10632 , P11712 -arg144 , P11712 -cys144 , P33261 , P10635 , P08684 and P20815 supplemented with an NADPH-generating system . DB01267 was determined by a new HPLC method with an Hypersil CN column and a UV detector . Of these enzymes , CYPs 2D6 , 3A4 and 3A5 were found to be the ones capable of metabolising risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone , with activities of 7.5 , 0.4 and 0.2 pmol pmol(-1) CYP min(-1) , respectively . A correlation study using a panel of human liver microsomes showed that the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone is highly correlated with P10635 and 3A activities . Thus , both P10635 and 3A4 are involved in the 9-hydroxylation of risperidone at the concentration of risperidone used in this study . This observation is confirmed by the findings that both quinidine ( inhibitor of P10635 ) and ketoconazole ( inhibitor of P08684 ) can inhibit the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone . Furthermore , inducers of CYP can significantly increase the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone in rat . The formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone is highly correlated with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activities , suggesting that inducible CYP3A contributes significantly to the metabolism of risperidone in rat . Allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 40 candidate genes for gene-environment studies on cancer : data from population-based Japanese random samples . Knowledge of genetic polymorphisms in gene-environment studies may contribute to more accurate identification of avoidable risks and to developing tailor-made preventative measures . The aim of this study was to describe the allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of select genes , which may be included in future gene-environment studies on cancer in Japan . SNP typing was performed on middle-aged Japanese men randomly selected from the general population in five areas of Japan . We genotyped and calculated allele frequencies of 153 SNPs located on 40 genes : P04798 , Q16678 , P11712 , P33261 , P05181 , P05093 , P11511 , P35869 , P03372 , Q92731 , ERRRG , P06401 , P07099 , P34913 , P37059 , P37058 , P28161 , P21266 , GSTT2 , P09211 , NAT1 , NAT2 , P21964 , P07327 , P00325 , P00326 , P05091 , P35228 , NOS3 , P01583 , P01584 , O15527 , P36639 [ P36639 ] , P14416 , P35462 , P21917 , P31645 , P04150 [ GCCR ] , P42898 , and P15559 . In the present study , the Japanese allele frequencies were verified by using nationwide population samples . [ Innate resistance to thymidylate synthase inhibition after 5-fluorouracil treatment -- a rationale of combined use of cisplatin and its optimal administration dose ] . We examined the changes of the number of DB00322 MP binding sites of thymidylate thynthase ( TS-BS ) in Yoshida sarcoma after administration of DB00544 to the tumor bearing rats . We also investigated the optimal dose of DB00515 for the increase of intracellular folate level . In the group received consecutive 7-days administration of DB09327 ( U-7 group ) , total TS-BS was significantly increased compared with non-treatment group and the group received only DB09327 ( U-1 group ) . For free TS-BS , however , there was no difference despite of DB09327 administration . P04818 inhibition rate ( TSIR ) was , therefore , significantly high in U-7 group compared with U-1 group . It seemed necessary to take some counter measure for the induction of TS in the tumor tissue when DB00544 chemotherapy was performed . The optimal dose of DB00515 as a modulator of DB00544 was 1 mg/kg in rat when it was estimated from the changes of intracellular folate levels after administration , which was less than the dose to reveal its own anticancer effect . Platelet-associated antibodies , cellular immunity and FCGR3a genotype influence the response to rituximab in immune thrombocytopenia . DB00073 is widely used in autoimmune diseases including immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) , although the mechanism of effect remains unclear . This study describes the effects of rituximab on platelet-associated antibodies ( PA-APAs ) , B and T cell counts and clonality ( IGHV and TRG @ gene rearrangements ) , P08637 ( FcγRIIIa ) and P12318 ( FcγRIIa ) polymorphisms and correlation to anti- P29965 ( P29965 ) response . PA-APA levels fell more frequently in responders ( 6/8 ) than in non-responders ( 2/10 : P = 0·08-0·15 ) . Two responders had no PA-APAs . Two non-responders with a fall in PA-APAs had very high CD8 levels . One non-responder had a B cell clone , one responder and one non-responder had a T cell clone . 15/16 patients had the same responses to rituximab and antiCD40L . Patients with P08637 V/V polymorphisms were more likely to respond to rituximab ( P = 0·03 ) . In summary , the fall in PA-APAs in responders confirms the humoural effect of rituximab . Failure to respond in patients with very high CD8 levels , despite PA-APA fall indicates a role for T cell-mediated platelet/megakaryocyte destruction . Concordance of response to anti- P29965 suggests autoantibody-producing cells are under T cell control . Finally , the effect of FCGR polymorphisms on response confirms the importance of FCGR-mediated depletion of B cells in autoimmunity . This has implications on the pathology of ITP as well as the immunological effect of B cell depletion . Hyper-IgM , neutropenia , mild infections and low response to polyclonal stimulation : hyper-IgM syndrome or common variable immunodeficiency ? A young woman presenting respiratory infections , polyarthritis , severe neutropenia , and increased serum IgM was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) with good clinical and laboratory outcome followed by a loss of efficacy . The increased serum IgM associated to recurrent infections and autoimmune manifestations suggested the diagnosis of a hyper-IgM syndrome ( HIGMs ) . The frequency of peripheral T cells , the expression of P25942 on the patients ' B cells and P29965 on T cells and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( Q9GZX7 ) and uracil-DNA glycosylase ( P13051 ) at mRNA level was comparable to controls . In contrast , the frequency of B cells was one half of the healthy control and all cells showed an atypical phenotype . Although Q9GZX7 and P13051 were normal , class-switch recombination was not very efficient because circulating switched memory were reduced and , once stimulated with CpG , generated less antibody-secreting cells than controls . An increase in serum B Lymphocytes stimulator ( Q9Y275 ) was also found . The patient presented a peculiar clinical and immunological phenotype fitting for many aspects of both HIGM4 and Common Variable Immunodeficiency ( CVID ) . These findings underline the need to better explore the complex link between these two diseases .
DB01427 suppresses the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in human mononuclear cells . P01375 -alpha ( P01375 ) exerts a wide spectrum of biological activities and contributes to the pathophysiology of septic shock . Elevated circulating levels of P01375 have also been reported in patients with severe chronic heart failure . We studied the effect of amrinone , a class III cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of acute heart failure , on the synthesis of P01375 in vitro . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers or cells of a permanent monoblast cell line were stimulated for 20 h with bacterial lipopolysaccharide and different doses of amrinone . P01375 production is suppressed in a dose-dependent manner to a minimum of 9 % of controls with 1000 microM of amrinone , reaching half-maximal inhibition at 80 microM amrinone . This effect appears to be mediated via DB02527 , which accumulated nearly twofold in the presence of amrinone . Suppression of P01375 synthesis by therapeutically administered phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as amrinone may contribute to their beneficial effect in the treatment of heart failure . Modulation of the P22301 /IL-12 cytokine circuit by interferon-beta inhibits the development of epitope spreading and disease progression in murine autoimmune encephalomyelitis . IFN-beta has been shown to be effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . However , the primary mechanism by which IFN-beta mediates its therapeutic effect remains unclear . Recent studies indicate that under defined conditions , IFN-beta may downregulate DC expression of IL-12 . We and others have shown that IFN-beta may also downregulate P22301 . In light of the recently proposed paradigm that an P22301 /IL-12 immunoregulatory circuit controls susceptibility to autoimmune disease , we examined the effect of IFN-beta on the development and behavior of the autoreactive T cell repertoire during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , an animal model sharing many features with MS . SWXJ mice were immunized with the immunodominant p139-151 determinant of myelin proteolipid protein ( PLP ) , and at onset of EAE were treated every other day with IFN-beta . After eight weeks of treatment , we assessed autoreactivity and observed no significant IFN-beta effect on splenocyte proliferation or splenocyte production of P01579 , P60568 , P05112 , or P05113 in response to the priming determinant used to initiate disease . However , in IFN-beta treated mice , the cytokine profile in response to the priming immunogen was significantly skewed toward an increased production of P22301 and a concurrent decreased production of IL-12 . Moreover , the in vivo modulation of the P22301 /IL-12 immunoregulatory circuit in response to the priming immunogen was accompanied by an aborted development of epitope spreading . Our results indicate that IFN-beta induces a reciprocal modulation of the P22301 /IL-12 cytokine circuit in vivo . This skewed autoreactivity establishes an inflammatory microenvironment that effectively prevents endogenous self-priming thereby inhibiting the progression of disease associated with epitope spreading . Modulatory effects of heparin and short-length oligosaccharides of heparin on the metastasis and growth of LMD MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells in vivo . Expression of the chemokine receptor P61073 allows breast cancer cells to migrate towards specific metastatic target sites which constitutively express P48061 . In this study , we determined whether this interaction could be disrupted using short-chain length heparin oligosaccharides . Radioligand competition binding assays were performed using a range of heparin oligosaccharides to compete with polymeric heparin or heparan sulphate binding to I(125) P48061 . DB01109 dodecasaccharides were found to be the minimal chain length required to efficiently bind P48061 ( 71 % inhibition ; P < 0.001 ) . These oligosaccharides also significantly inhibited P48061 -induced migration of P61073 -expressing LMD MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells . In addition , heparin dodecasaccharides were found to have less anticoagulant activity than either a smaller quantity of polymeric heparin or a similar amount of the low molecular weight heparin pharmaceutical product , DB06822 . When given subcutaneously in a SCID mouse model of human breast cancer , heparin dodecasaccharides had no effect on the number of lung metastases , but did however inhibit ( P < 0.05 ) tumour growth ( lesion area ) compared to control groups . In contrast , polymeric heparin significantly inhibited both the number ( P < 0.001 ) and area of metastases , suggesting a differing mechanism for the action of polymeric and heparin-derived oligosaccharides in the inhibition of tumour growth and metastases . Myocardial tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in hypertensive and heart failure-prone rats . Acute increases in blood pressure ( BP ) increase myocardial tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha production , but it is not known whether chronic hypertensive stress elevates myocardial P01375 production , possibly contributing to cardiac remodeling , decreased cardiac function , and faster progression to heart failure . BP , cardiac function , and size were evaluated in normotensive [ Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) ] , spontaneously hypertensive ( SHR ) , and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure-prone ( SHHF ) rats at 6 , 12 , 15 , and 18 mo of age and in failing SHHF . Left ventricular tissues were evaluated for secretion of bioactive P01375 and inhibition of P01375 secretion by phosphodiesterase inhibitors . All ventricles secreted bioactive and immunoreactive P01375 , but secretion decreased with age . SHR and SHHF rats secreted more P01375 than SD rats at 6 mo of age , but only failing SHHF rats secreted significantly more P01375 at 18 mo . DB01427 inhibited P01375 secretion in all rats and was less potent but more efficacious than RO-201724 in all strains . P01375 secretion correlated with BP and left ventricular mass in 6-mo-old rats , but this relationship disappeared with age . Results suggest that hypertension and/or cardiac remodeling is associated with elevated myocardial P01375 , and , although hypertension , per se , did not maintain elevated cardiac P01375 levels , SHHF rats increase P01375 production during the end stages of failure . Catecholamine-producing cells in the synovial tissue during arthritis : modulation of sympathetic neurotransmitters as new therapeutic target . BACKGROUND : The proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory role of the sympathetic nervous system in early and late inflammation is an unresolved paradox . A drastic loss of sympathetic nerve fibres in the synovial tissue of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) has previously been demonstrated . The presence of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) -positive cells in RA and osteoarthritis ( OA ) has been determined , but the role of these cells in inflammation is still unclear . OBJECTIVE : To characterise TH-positive cells in inflamed RA and OA synovial tissue and to study their role in inflammation . METHODS : Synovial samples were obtained from 32 patients with OA and 19 patients with RA and from 10 control patients . Synovial tissue samples were used for immunofluorescence staining . Synovial cells were isolated by tissue digestion and immediately used for cell culture . For in vivo experiments , collagen type-II arthritis in DBA/1J mice was induced . RESULTS : TH+ cells were present only in inflamed tissue and not in controls . Catecholamine-storing vesicles and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 ( Q05940 ) were identified in the synovial tissue . Experimental increase of cytoplasmic catecholamines by Q05940 blockade strongly reduced tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) independently of canonical extracellular β-adrenergic signalling . In addition , Q05940 blockade increased cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) and DB02527 responsive element binding protein , responsible for P01375 inhibition . In vivo , appearance of Q05940 positive cells was confirmed . Q05940 blockade ameliorated inflammation also in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that local catecholamine-producing cells start to replace sympathetic nerve fibres around the onset of disease , and modulation of locally produced catecholamines has strong anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro . Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor cilomilast inhibits fibroblast-mediated collagen gel degradation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and neutrophil elastase . Tissue destruction , resulting in emphysema , can be a consequence of several pathologic processes . The current study evaluated the effects of the phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitor , cilomilast , and other PDE inhibitors on the ability of fibroblasts to degrade extracellular matrix . Using the three-dimensional collagen gel culture system , fibroblasts ( HFL-1 ) were cultured with tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , known to induce matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) release , and/or neutrophil elastase ( NE ) , which can induce MMP activation . On Day 4 , gels containing P01375 and NE were significantly degraded ( 20.8 +/- 2.9 % of original collagen content ) . DB03849 ( 10 micro M ) inhibited this degradation ( 84.4 +/- 8.4 % ) . DB01427 , a PDE3 inhibitor , and zaprinast , a O76074 inhibitor , had no effect . Gelatin zymography and immunoblotting revealed that fibroblasts cultured with P01375 released increased amounts of latent P03956 and -9 . The addition of NE resulted in the conversion of P03956 and -9 to their active forms , indicative of collagen degradation . DB03849 inhibited the release of P03956 and -9 , as well as conversion of P03956 to its active form . Using real-time PCR analysis , cilomilast 's effect on P03956 release was not associated with the proteinase 's mRNA expression , suggesting that the inhibition of release is regulated at the post-transcriptional level . These results suggest that cilomilast may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent in diseases characterized by excessive tissue destruction , such as emphysema . Pharmacological modulation of myocardial tumor necrosis factor alpha production by phosphodiesterase inhibitors . Phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) inhibitors are used as therapeutic agents for management of congestive heart failure . PDE inhibitors are potent inotropic and vasodilator drugs , which have also been shown to inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) production . P01375 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has the ability to produce cardiac depressant and other cardiovascular effects in many disease conditions . P01375 levels are elevated in patients with chronic congestive heart failure , and it is possible that P01375 may play a role in this condition . The effects of PDE inhibitors on P01375 secretion from rat heart were evaluated in this study . Rat left ventricle was minced and incubated for 4 hr with various PDE inhibitors , and the amount of P01375 secretion was evaluated by cytotoxicity assay . Ro-20 , 1724 , etazolate , amrinone , milrinone and pentoxifylline inhibited unstimulated P01375 production , with IC50 values of 1.87 , 2.07 , 13.9 , 153 and 201 microM , respectively . Lipopolysaccharide-induced P01375 secretion from rat left ventricle was also evaluated in this study . DB01427 , milrinone and pentoxifylline inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced P01375 secretion , with IC50 values of 14.8 , 81.6 and 748 microM , respectively , whereas Ro-2D , 1724 and etazolate had no effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced P01375 secretion . These results demonstrated that P01375 was secreted from rat left ventricle after 4 hr and different pharmacological manipulations were able to inhibit the secretion of P01375 from left ventricle . These initial pharmacological results may provide an important tool for further investigation into the beneficial effects of PDE inhibitors in congestive heart failure or other conditions where P01375 levels are elevated . DB00227 -stimulated superinduction of P16581 , P05362 and P19320 in P01375 activated human vascular endothelial cells . Inhibitors of P04035 ( statins ) reveal important pharmacological effects in addition to reducing the plasma LDL cholesterol level . In the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis , transendothelial migration of various leukocytes including monocytes is a crucial step . We , therefore , investigated the expression of P16581 , intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P19320 ) in vascular endothelial cells as influenced by lovastatin . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) express significant amounts of selectins and cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) within a few hours after stimulation with P01375 . This effect is potentiated by 100-200 % when the cells are pretreated with 0.1-2.5 microM lovastatin . The lovastatin-mediated increase in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface is dose-dependent and significant at lovastatin concentrations comparable to plasma levels in patients under lovastatin treatment . The lovastatin-potentiated increase of P16581 and CAMs is correlated with a corresponding increase of selectin- and P62158 -specific mRNA . We conclude that , in vivo , statin treatment could trigger an enhanced recruitment of macrophages that might support the cholesteryl ester efflux from the arteriosclerotic plaque . DB00877 unbalances the polarization of human macrophages to M1 . Plasticity is a hallmark of macrophages , and in response to environmental signals these cells undergo different forms of polarized activation , the extremes of which are called classic ( M1 ) and alternative ( M2 ) . DB00877 ( Q96PN7 ) is crucial for survival and functions of myeloid phagocytes , but its effects on macrophage polarization are not yet studied . To address this issue , human macrophages obtained from six normal blood donors were polarized to M1 or M2 in vitro by lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-γ or interleukin-4 ( P05112 ) , respectively . The presence of Q96PN7 ( 10 ng/ml ) induced macrophage apoptosis in M2 but not in M1 . Beyond the impact on survival in M2 , Q96PN7 reduced P61073 , CD206 and Q9NNX6 expression and stem cell growth factor-β , P55774 and Q99616 release . In contrast , in M1 Q96PN7 increased P42081 and P32248 expression and P05231 , tumour necrosis factor-α and IL-1β release but reduced CD206 and Q9NNX6 expression and P22301 , vascular endothelial growth factor and P55774 release . In view of the in vitro data , we examined the in vivo effect of Q96PN7 monotherapy ( 0·1 mg/kg/day ) in 12 patients who were treated for at least 1 month before islet transplant . Cytokine release by O00206 -stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a clear shift to an M1-like profile . Moreover , macrophage polarization 21 days after treatment showed a significant quantitative shift to M1 . These results suggest a role of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) into the molecular mechanisms of macrophage polarization and propose new therapeutic strategies for human M2-related diseases through P42345 inhibitor treatment . DB01427 and theophylline differentially regulate cytokine and nitric oxide production in endotoxemic mice . Intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels play an important role in the regulation of several immunological processes . Since elevation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and/or cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentration by inhibition of phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) is known to modulate the inflammatory response , we compared the effect of amrinone , an inhibitor of the PDE III isoenzyme , and of theophylline , a nonspecific PDE inhibitor , on the plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) , interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) , and nitric oxide response in mice to intraperitoneal injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . Intraperitoneal treatment of animals with amrinone ( 100 mg/kg ) 30 min before LPS administration decreased both plasma P05231 and P22301 concentrations in the first phase of the response , but enhanced plasma levels of these cytokines in the second part . In contrast , pretreatment of the animals with theophylline ( 100 mg/kg ) enhanced LPS-induced plasma P05231 and P22301 levels during the whole response . However , pretreatment with both PDE inhibitors resulted in a marked inhibition of LPS-evoked plasma concentrations of P01375 and nitrite/nitrate ( breakdown products of nitric oxide ) throughout the response . This study demonstrates for the first time that amrinone and theophylline possess differential , but primarily anti-inflammatory , properties during LPS-induced systemic inflammation in the mouse . The use of cytokine inhibitors . A new therapeutic insight into heart failure . Cytokines are being increasingly recognized as important factors in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of heart failure . Elevated levels of circulating cytokines have been reported in patients with heart failure , and various cytokines have been shown to depress myocardial contractility in vitro and in vivo . We have recently compared the effects on cytokine production of drugs for therapy of heart failure that have different effects on survival . DB01427 , pimobendan and vesnarinone , phosphodiesterase III inhibitors that have been shown to have short term haemodynamic benefits , inhibited P01375 production . Differential modulation of the production of IL-1beta and P05231 was observed ; amrinone and pimobendan enhanced the production of IL-1beta , whereas vesnarinone did not . As inotropic agents differentially modulate cytokine production , these agents may interfere with induction of inducible nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase through an inhibition of cytokine formation . Although differential modulation of the production of NO by inotropic agents may explain their different effect in patients with heart failure , further study is necessary to reach this conclusion . We have shown that amlodipine increases the survival of mice with viral myocarditis and inhibits expression of inducible NO synthase and production of NO in vivo and in vitro . The therapeutic effect of amlodipine may in part result from inhibition of overproduction of NO . As we learn more about the pathophysiological and pathogenetic role of cytokines in heart failure , it should be possible to design better and more targeted pharmacological agents . Furthermore , the investigation of inotropic agents that are effective against the production of cytokines may help in the classification of these agents . Enhanced goblet cell hyperplasia in HDC knockout mice with allergic airway inflammation . BACKGROUND : DB11320 is known to have immunoregulatory roles in allergic reactions through histamine receptor 1 ( P35367 ) , P25021 , Q9Y5N1 and Q9H3N8 . However , its role in goblet cell hyperplasia in the airways of asthma patients is yet to be clarified . OBJECTIVE : This study was designed to examine the role of histamine in goblet cell hyperplasia using histamine-deficient mice ( Hdc-/- mice ) with allergic airway inflammation . METHODS : Wild-type and Hdc-/- C57BL/6 mice were sensitized with ovalbumin ( OVA ) . After a 2-week exposure to OVA , goblet cell hyperplasia was evaluated . Cell differentials and cytokines in BALF were analyzed . The mRNA levels of P98088 and Gob-5 gene were determined quantitatively . RESULTS : The number of eosinophils in BALF increased in both the sensitized wild-type mice and Hdc-/- mice with OVA inhalation . In addition , the numbers of alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes in BALF increased significantly in the sensitized Hdc-/- mice with OVA inhalation compared to the wild-type mice under the same conditions . The concentrations of P05112 ( P05112 ) , P05113 , P35225 , Interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) and P60568 in the BALF all increased significantly in both groups compared to those exposed to saline . In particular , the concentration of P01375 in the Hdc-/- mice exposed to OVA was significantly higher than that in the wild-type mice under the same conditions . The mRNA levels of Gob-5 and P98088 , and the ratio of the goblet cells in the airway epithelium significantly increased in Hdc-/- mice exposed to OVA compared to wild-type mice . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggested that histamine may play a regulatory role in goblet cell hyperplasia in allergic airway inflammation . DB06287 induces surfactant lipid accumulation and lung inflammation in mice . Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) is a well-known adverse effect of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) inhibitors . However , it remains unknown how lung toxicities are induced by P42345 inhibitors . Here , we constructed a mouse model of P42345 inhibitor-induced ILD using temsirolimus and examined the pathogenesis of the disease . Male ICR mice were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of different doses of temsirolimus ( 3 or 30 mg·kg(-1)·wk(-1) ) or vehicle . DB06287 treatment increased capillary-alveolar permeability and induced neutrophil infiltration and fibrinous exudate into the alveolar space , indicating alveolar epithelial and/or endothelial injury . It also induced macrophage depletion and the accumulation of excessive surfactant phospholipids and cholesterols . Alveolar macrophage depletion is thought to cause surfactant lipid accumulation . To further examine whether temsirolimus has cytotoxic and/or cytostatic effects on alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells , we performed in vitro experiments . DB06287 inhibited cell proliferation and viability in both alveolar macrophage and alveolar epithelial cells . DB06287 treatment caused some signs of pulmonary inflammation , including upregulated expression of several proinflammatory cytokines in both bronchoalveolar lavage cells and lung homogenates , and an increase in lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . These findings indicate that temsirolimus has the potential to induce alveolar epithelial injury and to deplete alveolar macrophages followed by surfactant lipid accumulation , resulting in pulmonary inflammation . This is the first study to focus on the pathogenesis of P42345 inhibitor-induced ILD using an animal model . Aerosol vaccination with AERAS-402 elicits robust cellular immune responses in the lungs of rhesus macaques but fails to protect against high-dose Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge . Development of a vaccine against pulmonary tuberculosis may require immunization strategies that induce a high frequency of Ag-specific P01730 and CD8 T cells in the lung . The nonhuman primate model is essential for testing such approaches because it has predictive value for how vaccines elicit responses in humans . In this study , we used an aerosol vaccination strategy to administer AERAS-402 , a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus ( rAd ) type 35 expressing Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ags Ag85A , Ag85B , and TB10.4 , in bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) -primed or unprimed rhesus macaques . Immunization with BCG generated low purified protein derivative-specific P01730 T cell responses in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage . In contrast , aerosolized AERAS-402 alone or following BCG induced potent and stable Ag85A/b-specific P01730 and CD8 effector T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage that largely produced IFN-γ , as well as P01375 and P60568 . Such responses induced by BCG , AERAS-402 , or both failed to confer overall protection following challenge with 275 CFUs M. tuberculosis Erdman , although vaccine-induced responses associated with reduced pathology were observed in some animals . Anamnestic T cell responses to Ag85A/b were not detected in blood of immunized animals after challenge . Overall , our data suggest that a high M. tuberculosis challenge dose may be a critical factor in limiting vaccine efficacy in this model . However , the ability of aerosol rAd immunization to generate potent cellular immunity in the lung suggests that using different or more immunogens , alternative rAd serotypes with enhanced immunogenicity , and a physiological challenge dose may achieve protection against M. tuberculosis . [ P35354 inhibitor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , myth or reality ? ] . The discovery of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase , Cox-1 constitutive and Cox-2 inducible , has prompted the development of new molecules with high Cox-2 selectivity . These new NSAIDs belong to the coxib class and have theoretically a better digestive tolerability than classical NSAID have . In Belgium , rofecoxib ( ( Vioxx ) and celecoxib ( DB00482 ) are commercialized . DB00533 is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis ( 12.5 to 25 mg/d ) and celecoxib is indicated in osteoarthritis ( 200 mg/d ) and in rheumatoid arthritis ( 200 to 400 mg/d ) . Several studies have demonstrated their efficacy , similarly to classical NSAID as diclofenac ( Voltaren ) , naproxen ( Naprosyne ) , ibuprofen ( DB01050 ) and their superiority compared to placebo . Their safety profile for gastrointestinal events is proven in patients without ulcer history compared to classical NSAID . However , the concomitant use of aspirin decreases the benefit as demonstrated for celecoxib at 400 mg/d but not investigated for rofecoxib . The selective inhibition of Cox-2 with no effect on Cox-1 favors cardiovascular events in patients at risk . Other side effects are similar to classical NSAID . Thus Cox-2 inhibitors NSAID are interesting molecules for their sparing gastrointestinal activity . They must be used with caution in patients with ulcer history , in the elderly and in patients requiring aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis . Thalidomide suppresses Up-regulation of human immunodeficiency virus coreceptors P61073 and P51681 on P01730 + T cells in humans . Concurrent infection in patients with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection increases the expression of HIV coreceptors P61073 and P51681 . Thalidomide has beneficial effects in a number of HIV-associated diseases . The effect of thalidomide on P61073 and P51681 expression on P01730 + T cells was determined . Thalidomide produced a dose-dependent inhibition of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced up-regulation of P61073 and P51681 in vitro . Antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) also attenuated the LPS-induced HIV coreceptor up-regulation , which was not further reduced by thalidomide . Thalidomide ( 400 mg ) was orally administered to 6 men , and their blood was stimulated ex vivo with LPS , staphylococcal or mycobacterial antigens , or antibody to CD3 or P10747 cells . All stimuli induced up-regulation of HIV coreceptors , which was reduced after ingestion of thalidomide . Thalidomide may be beneficial in the treatment of intercurrent infections during HIV infection by reducing the up-regulation of P61073 and P51681 expression on P01730 + T cells induced by bacterial and mycobacterial antigens , by a mechanism that involves inhibition of P01375 . Serotonergic mechanisms in human allergic contact dermatitis . Expression of serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-HT ) , 5-HT receptors 1A ( 5-HT1AR ) and 2A , and serotonin transporter protein ( P31645 ) was studied in positive epicutaneous reactions to nickel sulphate in nickel-allergic patients , at 72 h post-challenge with the antigen . In addition , the effects of 5-HT2AR agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine ( DOI ) , and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) citalopram and fluoxetine , were tested on nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from nickel-allergic patients , regarding their proliferation and interleukin ( IL ) -2 production , as well as the effect of these SSRIs on a murine Langerhans ' cell-like line ( XS52 ) , regarding its IL-1beta production . Serotonin-positive platelets were increased in the inflamed skin compared with control skin . A decrease ( p < 0.01 ) in 5-HT1AR-positive mononuclear cells was evident in the eczematous skin compared with control skin , whereas 5-HT2AR- and P31645 -positive cells were increased ( p < 0.001 for both ) in the eczematous skin . Treatment of nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 5x10(-5) mol/l of DOI inhibited ( p < 0.01 ) the proliferation of nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells , while no effect was found regarding P60568 production . DB00215 at 10(-6) mol/l tended to inhibit the production of IL-1beta by the XS52 cell line . These results indicate the implication of the serotonergic system in the contact allergic reaction . Effect of the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor amrinone on cytokine and nitric oxide production in immunostimulated J774.1 macrophages . The level of intracellular cyclic nucleotides is a regulatory factor in a variety of immune processes . Increases in intracellular cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) and/or cyclic GMP ( cGMP ) concentration by the inhibition of phosphodiesterase have been shown to modulate the inflammatory response . DB01427 is a clinically used positive inotropic agent which elevates intracellular DB02527 and cGMP levels by selective inhibition of the phosphodiesterase III isoenzyme . In the current study , we investigated the effect of various concentrations ( 1-300 microM ) of amrinone on lipopolysaccharide-induced production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and of nitric oxide ( NO ) in vitro . In cultured murine J774.1 macrophages , 1 ng/ml-10 microg/ml of lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli O55: P46977 induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , interleukin-10 , and nitrite ( breakdown product of NO ) . Pretreatment of cells with amrinone caused a dose-dependent suppression of P01375 production in the concentration range of 1-100 microM . Furthermore , this drug suppressed NO production in the range of 30-300 microM . Similarly to the results in the J774.1 cells , amrinone also inhibited P01375 and NO production in the range of 10-100 microM in primary rat peritoneal macrophages . At 300 microM , but not at lower concentrations , amrinone inhibited interleukin-10 production in lipopolysaccharide-treated J774.1 macrophages . Pretreatment of the macrophages with 100 and 300 microM amrinone increased the lipopolysaccharide-elicited translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B . Taken together , our results indicate that the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor amrinone modulates the activation/production of many pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in endotoxin-stimulated cells . It remains to be further investigated how such immunomodulatory effects contribute to the clinical profile of the agent . Sources contributing to the average extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens . Mesolimbic dopamine neurons fire in both tonic and phasic modes resulting in detectable extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) . In the past , different techniques have targeted dopamine levels in the NAc to establish a basal concentration . In this study , we used in vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry ( FSCV ) in the NAc of awake , freely moving rats . The experiments were primarily designed to capture changes in dopamine caused by phasic firing - that is , the measurement of dopamine ' transients ' . These FSCV measurements revealed for the first time that spontaneous dopamine transients constitute a major component of extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc . A series of experiments were designed to probe regulation of extracellular dopamine . DB00281 was infused into the ventral tegmental area , the site of dopamine cell bodies , to arrest neuronal firing . While there was virtually no instantaneous change in dopamine concentration , longer sampling revealed a decrease in dopamine transients and a time-averaged decrease in the extracellular level . Dopamine transporter inhibition using intravenous GBR12909 injections increased extracellular dopamine levels changing both frequency and size of dopamine transients in the NAc . To further unmask the mechanics governing extracellular dopamine levels we used intravenous injection of the vesicular monoamine transporter ( Q05940 ) inhibitor , tetrabenazine , to deplete dopamine storage and increase cytoplasmic dopamine in the nerve terminals . DB04844 almost abolished phasic dopamine release but increased extracellular dopamine to ∼500 nM , presumably by inducing reverse transport by dopamine transporter ( Q01959 ) . Taken together , data presented here show that average extracellular dopamine in the NAc is low ( 20-30 nM ) and largely arises from phasic dopamine transients . Donor pre-treatment with everolimus or cyclosporine does not reduce ischaemia-reperfusion injury in a rat kidney transplant model . BACKGROUND : Immunosuppressive agents have been investigated in renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) and have frequently demonstrated a beneficial effect . Most studies focused on treatment of the recipient at the time of transplantation . Pre-treatment of these organs before injury ( pharmacological pre-conditioning ) may particularly protect these organs . This study aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of donor pre-treatment with cyclosporine ( DB00091 ) or the P42345 inhibitor everolimus or their combination against IRI during renal transplantation in a rat model . METHODS : Donors received vehicle , DB00091 ( 5 mg/kg ) , everolimus ( 0.5 mg/kg ) or CsA + everolimus . Two oral doses were administered to the donors at 24 h and again at 6 h prior to donor kidney removal . Syngeneic rat kidneys were preserved in UW solution for 24 h prior to transplantation . After 24 h of reperfusion , blood and tissue samples were collected from recipients for further analysis . RESULTS : Renal functions as determined by creatinine and necrosis scores were not different between the experimental groups . Cleaved caspase-3 , heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) , tumor-necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 -α ) and nitrotyrosine protein levels were not statistically different between the four treatment groups at 24 h post-transplantation . Blood NMR analysis on metabolic markers for IRI reveals no beneficial effects of donor pre-treatment on the 24-h outcome in transplantation . CONCLUSIONS : When given alone or as a combination to donors before organ recovery , cyclosporine or everolimus does not appear to ameliorate IRI . Inhibitors of DB00171 -binding cassette transporters suppress interleukin-12 p40 production and major histocompatibility complex II up-regulation in macrophages . DB00171 -binding cassette ( DB01048 ) transporters are a large family of proteins whose role is to translocate various substances across biological membranes . They include the Tangier disease protein ABC1 , sulfonylurea receptors ( Q09428 ) , multidrug resistance protein ( MDR ) , and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( P13569 ) . In the current study , we investigated the involvement of ABC transporters in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and/or interferon ( IFN ) -gamma-induced interleukin ( IL ) -12 p40 and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha production , nitric oxide formation , as well as major histocompatibility complex II up-regulation in macrophages . The general ABC transporter inhibitor glibenclamide suppressed both IL-12 p40 and nitric oxide production . However , glibenclamide failed to affect the production of P01375 . The selective ABC1 inhibitors 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and sulfobromophthalein mimicked the suppressive effect of glibenclamide on IL-12 p40 production . On the other hand , both the MDR inhibitor verapamil and P13569 blocker 2,2'-iminodibenzoic acid failed to suppress the production of IL-12 p40 . Furthermore , selective inhibitors and activators of SURs were without effect . In agreement with the pharmacological data , macrophages expressed mRNA for ABC1 , but not SURs or P13569 . Intracellular levels of IL-12 p40 were decreased by glibenclamide , suggesting that glibenclamide does not affect IL-12 p40 secretion . The effect of glibenclamide did not involve an interference with the activation of the p38 and Q8NFH3 /44 mitogen-activated protein kinases or c-Jun kinase . DB01016 also suppressed P01579 -induced up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex II . Taken together , our results indicate that ABC proteins regulate LPS and/or P01579 -induced macrophage activation . P62158 and troponin C : affinity chromatographic study of divalent cation requirements for troponin I inhibitory peptide ( residues 104-115 ) , mastoparan and fluphenazine binding . The different conformations induced by the binding of Mg2+ or Ca2+ to troponin C ( TnC ) and calmodulin ( P62158 ) results in the exposure of various interfaces with potential to bind target compounds . The interaction of TnC or P62158 with three affinity columns with ligands of either the synthetic peptide of troponin I ( TnI ) inhibitory region ( residues 104-115 ) , mastoparan ( a wasp venom peptide ) , or fluphenazine ( a phenothiazine drug ) were investigated in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ . TnC and P62158 in the presence of either Ca2+ or Mg2+ bound to the TnI peptide 104-115 . The cation specificity for this interaction firmly establishes that the TnI inhibitory region binds to the high affinity sites of TnC ( most likely the N-terminal helix of site III ) and presumably the homologous region of P62158 . Mastoparan interacted strongly with both proteins in the presence of Ca2+ but , in the presence of Mg2+ , did not bind to TnC and only bound weakly to P62158 . DB00623 bound to TnC and P62158 only in the presence of Ca2+ . When the ligands interacted with either proteins there was an increase in cation affinity , such that TnC and P62158 were eluted from the TnI peptide or mastoparan affinity column with 0.1 M DB00974 compared with the 0.01 M DB00974 required to elute the proteins from the fluphenazine column . The interaction of these ligands with their receptor sites on TnC and P62158 require a specific and spatially correct alignment of hydrophobic and negatively charged residues on these proteins. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Metalloproteinases control brain inflammation induced by pertussis toxin in mice overexpressing the chemokine P13500 in the central nervous system . Inflammatory leukocytes infiltrate the CNS parenchyma in neuroinflammation . This involves cellular migration across various structures associated with the blood-brain barrier : the vascular endothelium , the glia limitans , and the perivascular space between them . Leukocytes accumulate spontaneously in the perivascular space in brains of transgenic ( Tg ) mice that overexpress P13500 under control of a CNS-specific promoter . The Tg mice show no clinical symptoms , even though leukocytes have crossed the endothelial basement membrane . Pertussis toxin ( PTx ) given i.p. induced encephalopathy and weight loss in Tg mice . We used flow cytometry , ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging , and immunofluorescent staining to show that encephalopathy involved leukocyte migration across the glia limitans into the brain parenchyma , identifying this as the critical step in inducing clinical symptoms . Metalloproteinase ( MPs ) enzymes are implicated in leukocyte infiltration in neuroinflammation . Unmanipulated Tg mice had elevated expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -10 , and -12 mRNA in the brain . PTx further induced expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 , metalloproteinase disintegrins-12 , P22894 , and -10 in brains of Tg mice . Levels of the microglial-associated MP P51511 were not affected in control or PTx-treated Tg mice . PTx also up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and P01375 mRNA in Tg CNS . Weight loss and parenchymal infiltration , but not perivascular accumulation , were significantly inhibited by the broad-spectrum MP inhibitor BB-94/ DB03880 . Our finding that MPs mediate PTx-induced parenchymal infiltration to the chemokine-overexpressing CNS has relevance for the pathogenesis of human diseases involving CNS inflammation , such as multiple sclerosis . DB00501 enhances antigen-specific IgE and Th2 cytokine production . BACKGROUND : Treatment with anti-ulcer drugs has been shown to enhance IgE production against food antigens . However , little is known about the immunological effects of cimetidine , a histamine receptor type 2 ( P25021 ) antagonist that is widely used as an anti-ulcer drug , in allergy . Therefore , the present study investigated the role of cimetidine in Th2 immune responses in mice . METHODS : BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin ( OVA ) with and without cimetidine . The levels of cytokines in supernatants of spleen cells cultured in the presence of OVA for 4 days and the levels of total and OVA-specific IgG(1) , IgG(2a) and/or IgE in sera from these mice were determined by ELISA . RESULTS : Administration of cimetidine to OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice promoted Th2 cytokine secretion by OVA-stimulated spleen cells in vitro and increased serum levels of OVA-specific IgE , IgG(1) and IgG(2a) . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that cimetidine can enhance Th2 responses , suggesting that cimetidine may contribute to IgE production in allergies . Novel marine phenazines as potential cancer chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory agents . Two new ( 1 and 2 ) and one known phenazine derivative ( lavanducyanin , 3 ) were isolated and identified from the fermentation broth of a marine-derived Streptomyces sp . ( strain CNS284 ) . In mammalian cell culture studies , compounds 1 , 2 and 3 inhibited P01375 -α-induced NFκB activity ( IC₅₀ values of 4.1 , 24.2 , and 16.3 μM , respectively ) and LPS-induced nitric oxide production ( IC₅₀ values of > 48.6 , 15.1 , and 8.0 μM , respectively ) . PGE₂ production was blocked with greater efficacy ( IC₅₀ values of 7.5 , 0.89 , and 0.63 μM , respectively ) , possibly due to inhibition of cyclooxygenases in addition to the expression of P35354 . Treatment of cultured HL-60 cells led to dose-dependent accumulation in the subG1 compartment of the cell cycle , as a result of apoptosis . These data provide greater insight on the biological potential of phenazine derivatives , and some guidance on how various substituents may alter potential anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects .
Effects of neuropeptides on human lung fibroblast proliferation and chemotaxis . An increase in subepithelial mesenchymal cells and associated connective tissue is a feature of bronchial asthma . We determined whether neuropeptides could modulate fibroblast activity , particularly with respect to proliferation and chemotaxis . Human lung fibroblasts were cultured with neurokinin A ( P20366 ) , DB05875 ( SP ) , vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) , and calcitonin-gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) . After 48 h , fibroblast proliferation was measured by a colorimetric assay based on the uptake and subsequent release of methylene blue . The chemotactic response to neuropeptides was determined with the use of a modified Boyden chamber . Both P20366 and SP ( 10(-7)-10(-4) M ) stimulated human lung fibroblast proliferation in Q03591 and IMR-90 fibroblasts . P01282 and P80511 had no effect on fibroblast proliferation . P20366 alone stimulated fibroblast chemotaxis maximally at 10(-10) M . P08473 ( NEP ) activity of 0.52 and 5.2 pmol/10(6) cells was assayed in IMR-90 and Hs68 fibroblasts , respectively . DB02557 ( 5 x 10(-6)-10(-5) M ) , an NEP inhibitor , enhanced fibroblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . Thus neuropeptides have the potential to cause activation of mesenchymal cells , and neuropeptide release may contribute to the structural abnormalities observed in asthmatic airways . Suppression of parathyroid hormone-related protein messenger RNA expression by medroxyprogesterone acetate in breast cancer tissues . The level of parathyroid hormone-related protein ( P12272 ) expressed in breast cancer tissue is closely related to the incidence of bone metastasis . We examined the P12272 mRNA expression in breast cancer tissues by coamplification polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) in mole ratio to internal standard beta-actin mRNA . The P12272 expression was higher in premenopausal patients than in postmenopausal patients ( P < 0.05 ) . More pronounced difference by menopause found in estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive groups ( P < 0.001 ) indicated that the P12272 expression in breast cancer tissue is hormonally regulated and might be altered by endocrine agents . To clarify the changes of P12272 expression by endocrine therapy of breast cancer , we measured P12272 expression in the breast cancer tissue incubated for 24 h with 1 x 10(-8) M of estradiol ( E2 ) , 1 x 10(-6) M of tamoxifen ( TAM ) and 1 x 10(-5) M of medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DB00603 ) . The P12272 expression was decreased significantly by DB00603 ( P < 0.005 ) , while E2 and TAM did not change the P12272 expression . P06401 ( PgR ) mRNA expression was also examined to confirm that the breast cancer tissue responds to E2 and TAM . The results were well compatible with the better therapeutic effect of DB00603 reported for the treatment of breast cancer with bone metastases . As a potential candidate for the receptor that mediates the suppressive effect of DB00603 , androgen receptor ( AR ) is suggested most probable . Present results also demonstrated that the clinical response of individual tumors is closely associated with the early in vitro changes of gene expression detected in the cancer specimen . Natriuretic peptide receptor A signaling regulates stem cell recruitment and angiogenesis : a model to study linkage between inflammation and tumorigenesis . Natriuretic peptide receptor A ( NPRA ) , the signaling receptor for the cardiac hormone , atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , is expressed abundantly in inflamed/injured tissues and tumors . NPRA deficiency substantially decreases tissue inflammation and inhibits tumor growth . However , the precise mechanism of NPRA function and whether it links inflammation and tumorigenesis remains unknown . Since both injury repair and tumor growth require stem cell recruitment and angiogenesis , we examined the role of NPRA signaling in tumor angiogenesis as a model of tissue injury repair in this study . In in vitro cultures , aortas from NPRA-KO mice show significantly lower angiogenic response compared to wild-type counterparts . The NPRA antagonist that decreases NPRA expression , inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced angiogenesis . The reduction in angiogenesis correlates with decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 4 ( P61073 ) implicating a cell recruitment defect . To test whether NPRA regulates migration of cells to tumors , DB05914 ( MSCs ) were administered i.v. , and the results showed that MSCs fail to migrate to the tumor microenvironment in NPRA-KO mice . However , coimplanting tumor cells with MSCs increases angiogenesis and tumorigenesis in NPRA-KO mice , in part by promoting expression of P61073 and its ligand , stromal cell-derived factor 1α . Taken together , these results demonstrate that NPRA signaling regulates stem cell recruitment and angiogenesis leading to tumor growth . Thus , NPRA signaling provides a key linkage between inflammation and tumorigenesis , and NPRA may be a target for drug development against cancers and tissue injury repair . Suppression of 3-deoxyglucosone and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor mRNA expression by an aldose reductase inhibitor in rat vascular smooth muscle cells . Reactive carbonyl compounds and oxidative stress have been recently shown to up-regulate the expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB- P01133 ) , a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) produced by SMC themselves . Because the polyol pathway has been reported to influence the formation of carbonyl compounds and the oxidative stress in various cells , we conducted this study to investigate whether the polyol pathway affects HB- P01133 expression along with the generation of carbonyl compounds and the oxidative stress in SMCs . We found that , compared with those cultured with 5.5mM glucose , SMCs cultured with 40 mM glucose showed the accelerated thymidine incorporation , elevated levels of intracellular sorbitol , 3-deoxyglucosone ( 3-DG ) , advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) , and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) along with the enhanced expression of HB- P01133 mRNA . An aldose reductase inhibitor ( Q9Y4X5 ) , Q9NYY3 -860 , significantly inhibited all of these abnormalities , while aminoguanidine suppressed 3-DG levels and HB- P01133 mRNA expression independent of sorbitol levels . The results suggest that the polyol pathway may play a substantial role in SMC hyperplasia under hyperglycemic condition in part by affecting HB- P01133 mRNA expression via the production of carbonyl compounds and oxidative stress . Selective inhibition of the tumor marker O60218 by antiinflammatory N-phenylanthranilic acids and glycyrrhetic acid . A human aldose reductase-like protein , O60218 in the aldo-keto reductase ( AKR ) superfamily , was recently identified as a tumor marker of several types of cancer . DB02383 , an aldose reductase inhibitor ( Q9Y4X5 ) , is known to be the most potent inhibitor of the enzyme . In this study , we compared the inhibitory effects of other ARIs including flavonoids on O60218 and aldose reductase to evaluate their specificity . However , ARIs showed lower inhibitory potency for O60218 than for aldose reductase . In the search for potent and selective inhibitors of O60218 from other drugs used clinically , we found that non-steroidal antiinflammatory N-phenylanthranilic acids , diclofenac and glycyrrhetic acid competitively inhibited O60218 , showing K(i) values of 0.35-2.9 microM and high selectivity to this enzyme ( 43-57 fold versus aldose reductase ) . Molecular docking studies of mefenamic acid and glycyrrhetic acid in the O60218 -nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADP(+) ) complex and site-directed mutagenesis of the putative binding residues suggest that the side chain of Val301 and a hydrogen-bonding network among residues Val301 , Gln114 and Ser304 are important for determining the inhibitory potency and selectivity of the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs . Thus , the potent and selective inhibition may be related to the cancer chemopreventive roles of the drugs , and their structural features may facilitate the design of new anti-cancer agents targeting O60218 . DB00175 -induced proangiogenic effects depend upon extracellular P09038 . The P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) have been shown to exert several protective effects on the vasculature that are unrelated to changes in the cholesterol profile , and to induce angiogenesis . The proangiogenic effect exerted by statins has been attributed to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in endothelial cells ; however , it is unclear how statins activate this pathway . DB00175 -mediated activation of Akt and MAPK occurs rapidly ( within 10 min. ) and at low doses ( 10 nM ) . Here , we hypothesized that P09038 contributes to the proangiogenic effect of statins . We found that pravastatin , a hydrophilic statin , induced phosphorylation of the FGF receptor ( FGFR ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . SU5402 , an inhibitor of FGFR , abolished pravastatin-induced PI3K/Akt and MAPK activity . Likewise , anti- P09038 function-blocking antibodies inhibited Akt and MAPK activity . Moreover , depletion of extracellular P09038 by heparin prevented pravastatin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK . Treatment with P09038 antibody inhibited pravastatin-enhanced endothelial cell proliferation , migration and tube formation . These observations indicate that pravastatin exerts proangiogenic effects in endothelial cells depending upon the extracellular P09038 . Coronary atherosclerosis : current therapeutic approaches and future trends . Invasive cardiovascular procedures , such as percutaneous translumenal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) and aorto-coronary bypass surgery ( ACBS ) , that are currently employed in treating the coronary stenosis or occlusion caused by atherosclerosis represent a major therapeutic advance for managing coronary heart disease ( Q8NE62 ) . However , the cellular proliferative response and associated intimal hyperplasia that can follow the damage to blood vessels that occurs with these procedures leads to late complications which can not be effectively controlled by presently available drugs . Hence , a new approach is required for managing these complications , termed " restenosis " ( in the case of PTCA ) or " stenosis " ( in the case of ACBS ) . Existing drug therapy is reviewed and some new approaches to this problem are provided herein . Further studies of growth factors and other substances that influence the cellular proliferative response that follows injury to the blood vessel wall could lead to the development of effective therapy . Inhibition of intimal hyperplasia and/or acceleration of endothelial cell re-growth provide a basis for such new approaches . Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , as well as DB00435 (s) ( EDRF ) and calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) are among the substances discussed . Modification of certain currently available drugs ( e.g. Ca(2+)-antagonists ) could also be of value in meeting this therapeutic demand . P05231 - P40763 -HIF signaling and therapeutic response to the angiogenesis inhibitor sunitinib in ovarian clear cell cancer . PURPOSE : Ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma ( OCCA ) is an uncommon histotype that is generally refractory to platinum-based chemotherapy . We analyze here the most comprehensive gene expression and copy number data sets , to date , to identify potential therapeutic targets of OCCA . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Gene expression and DNA copy number were carried out using primary human OCCA tumor samples , and findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays . Circulating interleukin ( IL ) 6 levels were measured in serum from patients with OCCA or high-grade serous cancers and related to progression-free and overall survival . Two patients were treated with sunitinib , and their therapeutic responses were measured clinically and by positron emission tomography . RESULTS : We find specific overexpression of the P05231 - P40763 -HIF ( interleukin 6-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-hypoxia induced factor ) pathway in OCCA tumors compared with high-grade serous cancers . Expression of P12272 and high levels of circulating P05231 in OCCA patients may explain the frequent occurrence of hypercalcemia of malignancy and thromboembolic events in OCCA . We describe amplification of several receptor tyrosine kinases , most notably MET , suggesting other potential therapeutic targets . We report sustained clinical and functional imaging responses in two OCCA patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease who were treated with sunitinib , thus showing significant parallels with renal clear cell cancer . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings highlight important therapeutic targets in OCCA , suggest that more extensive clinical trials with sunitinib in OCCA are warranted , and provide significant impetus to the growing realization that OCCA is molecularly and clinically distinct to other forms of ovarian cancer . Estrogenic chemicals at puberty change ERalpha in the hypothalamus of male and female rats . The effects of two environmental endocrine disruptors , the synthetic pharmaceutical estrogen DB00977 ( EE ) and bisphenol-A ( Q03001 ) , were analysed in male and female rats in a very sensitive developmental period , puberty . Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate changes in the number of cells expressing estrogen receptors ( P03372 ) in the arcuate nucleus ( ARC ) , ventromedial nucleus ( VMH ) and medial preoptic area ( DB00603 ) of the hypothalamus . Animals were treated during early puberty , from P01160 23 to P01160 30 , with EE and Q03001 given orally every day . They were then sacrificed and perfused on P01160 37 or P01160 90 , and blood and brains were collected for hormonal determination ( testosterone and estradiol ) and immunohistochemistry ( estrogen receptors , ER ) . At P01160 37 , ER-labelled neurons were higher in males than in females in the ARC and DB00603 . EE and Q03001 increased ER-labelled neurons in the ARC and DB00603 . At P01160 90 , females showed higher ER-labelled neurons in the VMH . EE and Q03001 increased ER-labelled neurons in the DB00603 in females . EE increased testosterone in males at P01160 37 and estradiol in females at P01160 90 . These results indicate the ability of estrogenic chemicals to change the reproductive neural circuits during puberty in male and female rats . DB01645 potentiates the P01160 effect on a K(+)-conductance in P29320 -293 cells . P29320 -293 cells are known to reflect many features of the late distal tubule . Furthermore , they have the ability to release urodilatin , the structural analog to P01160 . RT-PCR was performed to test for the expression of natriuretic peptide receptors . While the mRNA for the human P01160 receptor ( P16066 , P16066 ) could be amplified , the P09543 -specific receptor P20594 ( P20594 ) and the receptor specific for guanylins , P25092 , could not be detected . In patch clamp experiments the effects of P01160 ( 10 nM ) on membrane voltage ( V(m) ) were monitored and P29320 -293 cells depolarized by 2.3 +/- 0.5 mV ( n=14 ) . In the presence of the P01133 receptor blocker genistein ( 10 microM ) the effect of P01160 was increased by 65 % to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mV ( n=14 ) . After removal of genistein the P01160 -mediated depolarization further increased by 147 % to 5.7 +/- 1.0 mV ( n=14 ) . P01160 given repetitively without genistein had no increasing depolarizing effect in P29320 -293 cells with time . The P01160 effect could be fully blocked by 1 mM Ba(2+) and by 1 microM of the specific PKG inhibitor KT5823 indicating that P01160 inhibits a K(+)-conductance via a cGMP-dependent protein kinase . DB01645 itself hyperpolarized the membrane voltage of P29320 -293 cells by -3.9 +/- 0.6 mV ( n=11 ) and this effect could also be fully blocked by Ba(2+) ( -0.3 +/- 0.1 mV , n=5 ) , indicating that genistein activates a K(+)-conductance which contributes significantly to the membrane potential of P29320 -293 cells . Atrial natriuretic peptide : a possible mediator involved in dexamethasone 's inhibition of cell proliferation in multiple myeloma . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) has been recognized for several decades for its role of regulating blood pressure . Recently , cumulating evidences show that P01160 plays an anticancer role in various solid tumors via blocking the kinase cascade of Ras- Q02750 /2- P27361 /2 with the result of inhibition of DNA synthesis . P01160 , as well as its receptors ( P16066 and P17342 ) has been identified present in the embryonic stem cell and a wide range of cancer cells . Various lymphoid organs , such as lymph nodes , have been detected the presence of P01160 . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , though the therapies have evolved significantly , is still an incurable disease as B lymphocyte cell neoplasm . Dexamethasone is the cornerstone in treatment of MM via inactivation of Ras- Q02750 /2- P27361 /2 cascade reaction . Coincidently , dexamethasone can increase the expression of P01160 markedly . Nevertheless , the role of P01160 in MM is unclear . Based on these results above , we raise the hypothesis that P01160 is involved in mediating dexamethasone 's inhibition of proliferation in MM cells , which suggests that P01160 may be a potential agent to treat MM . P03372 alpha augments changes in hemostatic gene expression in HepG2 cells treated with estradiol and phytoestrogens . Phytoestrogens are popular alternatives to estrogen therapy however their effects on hemostasis in post-menopausal women are unknown . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the phytoestrogens , genistein , daidzein and equol on the expression of key genes from the hemostatic system in human hepatocyte cell models and to determine the role of estrogen receptors in mediating any response seen . HepG2 cells and Hep89 cells ( expressing estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ) ) were incubated for 24 h with 50 nM 17β-estradiol , genistein , daidzein or equol . Tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , Factor VII , fibrinogen γ , protein C and protein S mRNA expression were determined using TaqMan PCR . DB01645 and equol increased tPA and P05121 expression in Hep89 cells with fold changes greater than those observed for estradiol . In HepG2 cells ( which do not express ERα ) , P05121 and tPA expression were unchanged . Increased expression of Factor VII was observed in phytoestrogen treated Hep89 cells but not in similarly treated HepG2s . P00734 gene expression was increased in equol and daidzein treated HepG2 cells in the absence of the classical estrogen receptors . These data suggest that phytoestrogens can regulate the expression of coagulation and fibrinolytic genes in a human hepatocyte cell line ; an effect which is augmented by ERα . Molecular targets and regulators of cardiac hypertrophy . Cardiac hypertrophy is one of the main ways in which cardiomyocytes respond to mechanical and neurohormonal stimuli . It enables myocytes to increase their work output , which improves cardiac pump function . Although cardiac hypertrophy may initially represent an adaptive response of the myocardium , ultimately , it often progresses to ventricular dilatation and heart failure which is one of the leading causes of mortality in the western world . A number of signaling modulators that influence gene expression , apoptosis , cytokine release and growth factor signaling , etc. are known to regulate heart . By using genetic and cellular models of cardiac hypertrophy it has been proved that pathological hypertrophy can be prevented or reversed . This finding has promoted an enormous drive to identify novel and specific regulators of hypertrophy . In this review , we have discussed the various molecular signal transduction pathways and the regulators of hypertrophic response which includes calcineurin , cGMP , NFAT , natriuretic peptides , histone deacetylase , P05231 cytokine family , Gq/ P49842 signaling , PI3K , MAPK pathways , Na/H exchanger , DB01367 , polypeptide growth factors , P01160 , NO , P01375 , Q07869 and JAK/ P35610 pathway , microRNA , Cardiac angiogenesis and gene mutations in adult heart . Augmented knowledge of these signaling pathways and their interactions may potentially be translated into pharmacological therapies for the treatment of various cardiac diseases that are adversely affected by hypertrophy . The purpose of this review is to provide the current knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy , with special emphasis on novel researches and investigations . Genetic factors influencing outcome from neurotrauma . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Clinical outcome after neurotrauma is considerably variable and can only partly be explained by known prognostic factors . There is converging evidence from genetic research that a number of genetic variants may contribute to this variability . This review provides recent data from human studies , published in the previous year , on genetic factors influencing outcome after neurotrauma . The bibliographic databases MEDLINE , EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched to identify relevant studies . RECENT FINDINGS : Genetic susceptibility to various aspects of clinical outcome after neurotrauma was reported in recent clinical studies . Genetic loci investigated include polymorphisms in P02649 , P21397 , P23560 , NOS3 , P05231 , P12036 , P31645 , P21964 , P48454 and Q8IX03 genes . The importance of these findings and future directions are discussed . SUMMARY : Recent genetic studies have revealed emerging aspects and extended the existing knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of neurotrauma and the genetic influence on phenotypic diversity . A better understanding of the underlying biological pathways and molecular mechanisms of an individual 's response to neurotrauma may hold the promise of novel treatment strategies and improved clinical outcome . MEK inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer . P01116 mutations are the most common mutations in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) with adenocarcinoma histology . P01116 mutations result in the activation of the RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway , and agents that target RAF-MEK- P29323 pathways have been investigated in P01116 mutant NSCLC . The two agents furthest in development are selumetinib and trametinib . DB08911 has greater binding for the Q02750 /2 allosteric site , and generally has superior pharmacokinetics . A randomized phase II trial of docetaxel with and without selumetinib revealed that the combination resulted numerically superior overall survival , and a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate . However , a concerning rate of hospital admission , grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , and febrile neutropenia was observed with the combination . Trials have investigated MEK inhibitors as single agents and in combination with erlotinib , and the data do not support the further development . The activity of MEK inhibitors appears to be similar in patients with P01116 mutant and wild-type NSCLC suggesting P01116 mutation status is not a reliable biomarker for efficacy . It is possible that mutations of genes in addition to P01116 mutations impact the activity of MEK inhibitors , or specific subsets of P01116 mutations may be resistant or susceptible to MEK inhibition . Other potential explanations are gene amplifications , alternative RNA splicing of genes resulting in activation of their protein products , and deregulation of noncoding RNAs and consequent altered protein expression . Mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells in paediatric patients , prior to autologous transplantation following administration of plerixafor and DB00099 . Previous chemotherapy and radiation exposure can make adequate stem cell mobilisation prior to autologous transplant extremely difficult in paediatrics . DB06809 , a selective reversible P61073 antagonist interferes with P61073 interaction with P48061 alpha ( P48061 ) . Combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) amplifies G- P04141 affects in mobilising haematopoietic stem cells . Whilst licensed for use with G- P04141 for enhancement of mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells in adults , paediatric data for use of plerixafor remain limited . We present a retrospective review of outcomes seen with plerixafor and G- P04141 to mobilise stem cells heavily pre-treated paediatric patients with cancer . A randomized , placebo-controlled study of the effects of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB- DB05250 on blood biomarkers of inflammation in P48444 patients . The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling upregulates inflammation and is known to be increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) . The authors assessed the pharmacology of the novel p38 MAPK inhibitor SB- DB05250 using blood biomarkers in P48444 . Seventeen P48444 patients ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second 50 % -80 % predicted ) using short-acting bronchodilators participated in a double-blind , double-dummy , randomized , crossover study . Patients received single oral doses of SB- DB05250 7.5 mg and 25 mg , prednisolone 10 mg and 30 mg , and placebo . Blood was obtained predose and at 1 , 2 , 6 , and 24 hours postdose . Whole-blood sorbitol-induced phosphorylated ( p ) heat shock protein ( HSP ) 27 levels as a marker of p38 pathway activation and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha production were assessed . Both doses of SB- DB05250 , but not prednisolone , significantly ( P < .0001 ) reduced weighted mean ( WM ) pHSP27 ( 0-6 hours ) by 58 % compared with placebo . WM P01375 production ( 0-24 hours ) was significantly reduced compared with placebo by SB- DB05250 25 mg ( 40 % , P = .005 ) and 7.5 mg ( 33.4 % , P = .02 ) , while prednisolone 30 mg and 10 mg caused 81.5 % and 58.2 % suppression , respectively ( both P < .0001 ) . SB- DB05250 inhibited the p38 MAPK pathway to a greater degree than prednisolone did . SB- DB05250 inhibited P01375 production . SB- DB05250 is a potent p38 MAPK inhibitor that potentially suppresses inflammation in P48444 . Steroid hormone receptors and coregulators in endocrine-resistant and estrogen-independent breast cancer cells . Resistance to hormonal therapy is often a problem in the treatment of breast cancer patients . It has been suggested that resistance could be explained by altered nuclear hormone receptor or coregulator levels or inappropriately increased agonist activity of selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) . To test these hypotheses , we have established novel MCF-7 cell line-derived in vitro models of anti-estrogen- and progestin-resistant and estrogen-independent breast cancer by long-term culture in the presence of toremifene and medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DB00603 ) and in the absence of estradiol , respectively . Using cell growth and multiprobe ribonuclease protection assays , the expression of 5 nuclear hormone receptors and 9 coregulators as well as the alterations in the cell proliferation and target gene transcription in response to hormonal treatments were studied . P06401 ( PR ) expression was decreased and silencing mediator for retinoid acid and thyroid hormone receptors ( Q9Y618 ) and amplified in breast cancer-1 ( Q9Y6Q9 ) expression increased in anti-estrogen-resistant cells . Estrogen caused PR and ERbeta upregulation in all cell lines , but we did not observe increased agonist activity of anti-estrogen measured by regulation of these estrogen target genes . Basal ERalpha levels and estrogenic growth response were decreased and p300/CBP-associated factor ( pCAF ) and Q9Y6Q9 upregulated by estrogen in progestin-resistant cells , but coregulator levels were unchanged . Estrogen-independent cells were still estrogen-responsive and PR , nuclear receptor corepressor ( O75376 ) and Q9Y618 expression was increased whereas steroid receptor coactivator-1 ( P12931 -1a ) and CBP-related protein p300 ( p300 ) expression decreased . Their growth was inhibited by toremifene , but estradiol was able to abrogate this effect , which might have interesting clinical implications concerning the use of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy . P03372 -immunoreactive neurons contain calcitonin gene-related peptide , methionine-enkephalin or tyrosine hydroxylase in the female rat preoptic area . We have shown in our previous studies that estrogen treatment selectively influences calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) - , methionine-enkephalin ( DB00134 -Enk ) - and tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) -immunoreactive ( IR ) intensities in the neurons of the periventricular preoptic nucleus ( Q9H237 ) and the medial preoptic area ( DB00603 ) of the female rat . In the present study , we examined whether estrogen receptor ( ER ) -IR neurons in the Q9H237 and DB00603 contain P80511 , DB00134 -Enk , or TH using a double-labeling immunohistochemical method and investigated changes in the number of double-labeling cells upon treatment with estrogen . Brain sections of ovariectomized rats and ovariectomized and estrogen-treated rat were stained using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method followed by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method . The sections were first incubated with an anti-ER antibody in conjunction with nickel diaminobenzidine which produces a dark blue reaction product in the nucleus . Subsequently , P80511 , DB00134 -Enk or TH antisera were applied to these sections and the resulting brown diaminobenzidine reaction product in the cytoplasm was examined . Neurons that were double-labeled for ER and P80511 , DB00134 -Enk or TH were investigated in the Q9H237 and DB00603 . The number of doubly labeled ER/ P80511 - and ER/TH-IR neurons was large , whereas the number of ER/ DB00134 -Enk-IR neurons was small . These results suggest that ER in the Q9H237 and DB00603 may be more closely related to the mechanism of changes in P80511 - and TH-IR intensities upon estrogen treatment than that in DB00134 -Enk-IR intensity . DB01037 transdermal system : in the treatment of major depressive disorder . The monamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitor selegiline is selective for P27338 at the low oral dosages used in the treatment of Parkinson 's disease . However , P21397 is also inhibited at the high oral dosages needed to effectively treat depression ( not an approved indication ) , necessitating a tyramine-restricted diet . The selegiline transdermal system was designed to deliver antidepressant drug concentrations to the CNS , without substantially impairing small intestine P21397 activity . At the target dose of 6 mg/24 hours , tyramine dietary restrictions are not needed . Short-term treatment with fixed ( 6 mg/24 hours ) or flexible ( 6 , 9 or 12 mg/24 hours ) doses of selegiline transdermal system was superior to placebo on most measures of antidepressant activity in 6- or 8-week , randomised , double-blind , multicentre studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Likewise , long-term treatment with a fixed dose of selegiline transdermal system 6 mg/24 hours was superior to placebo as maintenance therapy in a 52-week , randomised , double-blind , multicentre , relapse-prevention trial in patients with MDD . DB01037 transdermal system therapy was generally well tolerated in placebo-controlled studies ; application site reactions , mostly of mild to moderate severity , were the most commonly reported adverse events . The incidence of sexual adverse effects and weight gain was low and similar to that with placebo . Curcumin sensitizes acute promyelocytic leukemia cells to unfolded protein response-induced apoptosis by blocking the loss of misfolded O75376 protein . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is characterized by accumulation of apoptosis-resistant immature promyelocytic cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood . We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) -associated degradation ( ERAD ) and protease-mediated degradation of misfolded nuclear receptor corepressor ( O75376 ) confer resistance to unfolded protein response ( UPR ) -induced apoptosis in APL . These findings suggest that therapeutic inhibition of O75376 misfolding or degradation may promote growth arrest in APL cells by sensitizing them to UPR-induced apoptosis . On the basis of this hypothesis , we tested the effects of several known protein conformation-modifying agents on the growth and survival of APL cells and identified curcumin , a natural component of turmeric , as a potent growth inhibitor of APL cells . Curcumin selectively inhibited the growth and promoted apoptosis in both primary and secondary leukemic cells derived from APL . The curcumin-induced apoptosis of APL cells was triggered by an amplification of ER stress , possibly from the accumulation of misfolded O75376 protein in the ER . Curcumin promoted this net accumulation of aberrantly phosphorylated misfolded O75376 protein by blocking its ERAD and protease-mediated degradation , which then led to the activation of UPR-induced apoptosis in APL cells . The activation of UPR by curcumin was manifested by phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase ( Q9NZJ5 ) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha ( eIF2α ) , and upregulation of C/EBP homologous protein ( P35638 ) and O75807 , the principal mediators of proapoptotic UPR . These findings identify the therapeutic potential of curcumin in APL and further establish the rationale of misfolded O75376 protein as an attractive molecular target in APL . Natriuretic peptide/natriuretic peptide receptor-A ( P16066 ) system has inhibitory effects in renal fibrosis in mice . OBJECT : This study was designed to examine whether natriuretic peptide/natriuretic peptide receptor-A ( P16066 ) system attenuates renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) model and also examined the mechanism involved . METHODS : Three groups were studied : untreated UUO in wild-type mice ; untreated UUO in P16066 KO mice ; and P01160 treated ( 0.05 microg/kg/min ) UUO in wild-type mice . We measured histological and immunohistochemical findings ( alpha-SMA and F4/80 ) , tissue cGMP levels , various mRNA expression levels by real-time PCR analysis , and transcription factor levels ( AP-1 and NF-kappaB ) in renal tissue . RESULTS : Compared with wild-type UUO mice , NPRA-KO UUO mice had abnormal morphological findings ( fibrous area : +26 % , alpha-SMA expression : +30 % ) with lower tissue cGMP levels and increases in the mRNA expression levels of TGF-beta , collagen I , collagen III , P05121 , renin and angiotensinogen , whereas there were no differences in F4/80 positive cells or the mRNA expression levels of P05362 , osteopontin , or P13500 between the two groups . In contrast , P01160 pre-treatment significantly improved morphological changes with increase of tissue cGMP levels and reduction in the mRNA expression level of TGF-beta , collagen I , collagen III , P05121 , P05362 , osteopontin , P13500 , renin , and angiotensinogen . NPRA-KO UUO mice had higher AP-1 levels than wild-type UUO mice and P01160 pre-treatment reduced AP-1 and NF-kappaB activity . CONCLUSION : The endogenous natriuretic peptide/ P16066 system may inhibit renal fibrosis partly via inhibition of the angiotensin/AP-1/TGF-beta/collagen pathway and exogenous P01160 pre-treatment may inhibit it partly via both the angiotensin/AP-1/TGF-beta/collagen and NF-kappaB/inflammatory pathways . DB00594 derivatives induce apoptosis by depleting ER Ca(2+) stores in vascular endothelial cells . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : DB00594 derivatives are blockers of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger ( NHE ) and at micromolar concentrations have protective effects on cardiac and brain ischaemia/reperfusion injury but at higher concentrations also induce apoptosis . Here , we aimed to elucidate the mechanism related to this cytotoxic action . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : We quantified the expression of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress and measured changes in luminal ER Ca(2+) concentration ( [Ca(2+)](ER) ) with a ' cameleon ' indicator , D1ER . KEY RESULTS : DB00594 derivatives induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells , an effect that increased at alkaline extracellular pH . The potency order for cytotoxicity was 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride ( HMA ) > 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl) amiloride > 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride ( EIPA ) >> amiloride . HMA dose-dependently increased the transcription of the ER stress genes P35638 and O75807 and rapidly depleted [Ca(2+)](ER) , mimicking the effects of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase ( SERCA ) inhibitor thapsigargin . The P19634 -specific inhibitor HOE 694 inhibited NHE activity by 87 % but did not alter [Ca(2+)](ER) . The decrease in [Ca(2+)](ER) evoked by amiloride derivatives was also observed in HeLa cells and was mirrored by an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : DB00594 derivatives disrupt ER and cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis by a mechanism unrelated to NHE inhibition , most likely by interfering with the activity of SERCA . We propose that ER Ca(2+) depletion and subsequent ER stress provide a rationale framework for the apoptotic effects of amiloride derivatives .
3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl bis-benzimidazole derivative , mitigates radiation-induced DNA damage . Radiation-induced DNA damage initiates a series of overlapping responses that include DNA damage recognition and repair , induction of cell cycle checkpoints , senescence and/or apoptosis . This study assessed the DNA damage response and whole genome expression profile in two mammalian cell lines ( P29320 and U87 ) in response to ( 5-{4-methylpiperazin-1-yl}-2-[2'-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5'-benzimidazolyl] benzimidazole ) P28067 and ionizing radiation . P28067 has been shown to act as a potent radiation protector , yielding significant levels of protection , i.e. , 20.9 % in P29320 cells and 21.2 % in U87 cells . Our findings revealed treatment with P28067 significantly reduced γ- P16104 , Q12888 and Rad51 foci formation after irradiation . Q96HU1 kinase , WNT signaling and p53 pathways were found to be activated in P28067 -treated cells . In addition , the DNA damage response genes , HSP70 , P10809 , Q06830 , Q9BXM0 , P27797 , P06748 , P0CG48 , and Q01105 showed differential regulation in P28067 , P28067 + radiation and radiation-treated cells . The data suggest that P28067 -influenced repertoire of repair proteins , which are an indispensable part of the cell , interplay with each other to reduce DNA damage and maintain the genomic integrity of the cell . DB00559 , an endothelin receptor antagonist , ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis : the role of P01375 -α in the induction of endothelin system genes . OBJECTIVE : Endothelins ( ETs ) are involved in several inflammatory events . The present study investigated the efficacy of DB00559 , a dual P25101 /ETB receptor antagonist , in collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) in mice . TREATMENT : CIA was induced in DBA/1J mice . Arthritic mice were treated with DB00559 ( 100 mg/kg ) once a day , starting from the day when arthritis was clinically detectable . METHODS : CIA progression was assessed by measurements of visual clinical score , paw swelling and hypernociception . Histological changes , neutrophil infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in the joints . Gene expression in the lymph nodes of arthritic mice was evaluated by microarray technology . PreproET-1 mRNA expression in the lymph nodes of mice and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was evaluated by real-time PCR . The differences were evaluated by one-way Q9UNW9 or Student 's t test . RESULTS : Oral treatment with DB00559 markedly ameliorated the clinical aspects of CIA ( visual clinical score , paw swelling and hyperalgesia ) . DB00559 treatment also reduced joint damage , leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels ( IL-1β , TNFα and Q16552 ) in the joint tissues . Changes in gene expression in the lymph nodes of arthritic mice returned to the levels of the control mice after DB00559 treatment . PreproET mRNA expression increased in PBMCs from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients but returned to basal level in PBMCs from patients under anti- P01375 therapy . In-vitro treatment of PBMCs with TNFα upregulated ET system genes . CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that ET receptor antagonists , such as DB00559 , might be useful in controlling RA . Moreover , it seems that ET mediation of arthritis is triggered by TNFα . The unexpected effect of cyclosporin A on CD56+CD16- and CD56+CD16+ natural killer cell subpopulations . DB00091 ( Q13216 ) is commonly used to prevent graft-versus-host disease . The influence of Q13216 on T-cell function has been extensively investigated ; however , the effect of Q13216 on natural killer ( NK ) cells is less understood . NK cells were cultured with P60568 and P40933 with and without Q13216 for 1 week . Compared with controls , Q13216 -treated cultures showed fewer CD56(+)CD16(+) P55040 (+) NK cells and a reciprocal increase in CD56(+)CD16(-) P55040 (-) cells . These changes were due mainly to a reduced proliferation of the CD56(dim) NK-cell subpopulation and a relative resistance of CD56(bright) NK cells to Q13216 . Following coculture with K562 targets , Q13216 -exposed NK cells differed from controls and lacked Ca(2+) oscillations , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) dephosphorylation , and NFAT nuclear translocation . NK cells cultured in Q13216 retained cytotoxicity against K562 , Raji , and P55040 ligand-expressing lymphoblastoid cells . NK cells cultured in Q13216 showed increases in O14931 and reductions in O95944 and P26718 . Following IL-12 and Q14116 stimulation , Q13216 -treated NK cells showed more P01579 -producing cells . Using in vitro NK-cell differentiation , progenitor cells gave rise to more CD56(+) P55040 (-) NK cells in the presence of Q13216 than controls . Collectively , these studies show that Q13216 influences NK-cell function and phenotype , which may have important implications for graft-versus-leukemia effects . Intracellular capture of P33681 in antigen-presenting cells reduces costimulatory activity . P16410 gene constructs were designed to express P16410 exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . Four different P16410 gene constructs were transfected into P29320 293 ( human embryonic kidney ) and A20 ( Balb/c mouse B lymphoma ) cells . All constructs contained an ER retention signal and coded for P16410 expression in the ER . One of the constructs , which contained the membrane part of P16410 , coded for an expression both on the cell surface and in the ER . Three of the expressed P16410 types ( including the ER-membrane-expressed form ) caused a reduced surface expression of P33681 in the A20 cells . Only constructs which allow dimerization of P16410 showed this effect . It is assumed that intracellular P16410 bound P33681 and inhibited therefore the transport of P33681 to the surface . The binding obviously caused also an enhanced degradation of the complexes because both proteins showed a low concentration in the transfected cell lines . P16410 -transfected and P33681 -reduced A20 cells showed a diminished costimulating activity upon T cells . This was demonstrated by a reduced proliferation of T cells from ovalbumin-immunized Balb/c mice , incubated with ovalbumin peptide-primed P16410 -transfected A20 cells . Induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein ameliorates atherosclerosis . BACKGROUND : Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and the subsequent processing of oxidized LDL ( oxLDL ) by macrophages results in activation of specific T cells , which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis . Oral tolerance induction and the subsequent activation of regulatory T cells may be an adequate therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis . METHODS AND RESULTS : Tolerance to oxLDL and malondialdehyde-treated LDL ( MDA-LDL ) was induced in P01130 -/- mice fed a Western-type diet by oral administration of oxLDL or MDA-LDL before the induction of atherogenesis . Oral tolerance to oxLDL resulted in a significant attenuation of the initiation ( 30 % to 71 % ; P < 0.05 ) and progression ( 45 % ; P < 0.05 ) of atherogenesis . Tolerance to oxLDL induced a significant increase in P01730 + CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes , and these cells specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production . Tolerance to oxLDL also increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3 , P16410 , and CD25 in the plaque . In contrast , tolerance to MDA-LDL did not affect atherogenesis . CONCLUSIONS : OxLDL-specific T cells , present in P01130 -/- mice and important contributors in the immune response leading to atherosclerotic plaque , can be counteracted by oxLDL-specific P01730 + CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells activated via oral tolerance induction to oxLDL . We conclude that the induction of oral tolerance to oxLDL may be a promising strategy to modulate the immune response during atherogenesis and a new way to treat atherosclerosis . Resistance to killing by tumor necrosis factor in an adipocyte cell line caused by a defect in arachidonic acid biosynthesis . We have found that Q96RJ0 -R6 , which are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) in the presence of cycloheximide ( Reid , T. R. , Torti , F. , and Ringold , G. M. ( 1989 ) J. Biol. Chem. 264 , 4583-4589 ) , have reduced ability to release arachidonic acid ( 20:4 ) from membrane phospholipids in response to either P01375 or the calcium ionophore A23187 treatment . However , no defect in the activity of phospholipase A2 , the principal enzyme responsible for the release of 20:4 from phospholipids , was observed in these cells . Detailed biochemical characterization of these P01375 -resistant cells has revealed that these cells are unable to synthesize 20:4 endogenously because of a defect in delta 6-desaturase , the rate-limiting enzyme of 20:4 biosynthesis . This deficiency leads to a marked decrease in the steady-state levels of 20:4 present in choline-containing phospholipid ( PC ) and ethanolamine-containing phospholipid ( PE ) . The Q96RJ0 -R6 cells , however , are capable of incorporating exogenous 20:4 into PC and PE , and when loaded in such manner they become significantly more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of P01375 in the presence of cycloheximide . Therefore , the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids appears to be a critical element in the signaling pathway utilized by P01375 and is essential to the rapid cytotoxic response elicited by P01375 in the absence of protein synthesis in wild-type Q96RJ0 cells . Immunoregulatory natural killer cells suppress autoimmunity by down-regulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice . Natural killer ( NK ) cells belong to the innate immune system . Besides their role in antitumor immunity , NK cells also regulate the activity of other cells of the immune system , including dendritic cells , macrophages , and T cells , and may , therefore , be involved in autoimmune processes . The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of NK cells within this context . Using two mouse models for type 1 diabetes mellitus , a new subset of NK cells with regulatory function was identified . These cells were generated from conventional NK cells by incubation with Q14116 and are characterized by the expression of the surface markers CD117 ( also known as c-Kit , stem cell factor receptor ) and programmed death ( PD ) -ligand 1 . In vitro analyses demonstrated a direct lysis activity of Q14116 -stimulated NK cells against activated insulin-specific CD8(+) T cells in a P18621 /PD-ligand 1-dependent manner . Flow cytometry analyses revealed a large increase of splenic and lymphatic NK1.1(+)/c-Kit(+) NK cells in nonobese diabetic mice at 8 wk of age , the time point of acceleration of adaptive cytotoxic immunity . Adoptive transfer of unstimulated and Q14116 -stimulated NK cells into streptozotocin-treated mice led to a delayed diabetes development and partial disease prevention in the group treated with Q14116 -stimulated NK cells . Consistent with these data , mild diabetes was associated with increased numbers of NK1.1(+)/c-Kit(+) NK cells within the islets . Our results demonstrate a direct link between innate and adaptive immunity in autoimmunity with newly identified immunoregulatory NK cells displaying a potential role as immunosuppressors . [ Anti-cholesterol agents , new therapeutic approaches ] . Statins and fibrates constitute the two major families of lipid-lowering agents . Statins are widely used for the treatment of pure hypercholesterolaemia while fibrates are used for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia . Both drugs are also used for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia . Some fibrates efficiently lower serum LDL-cholesterol . Statins inhibit P04035 and decrease cellular cholesterol synthesis . The resulting lower intracellular cholesterol concentration induces the activation of SREBP thus inducing the over expression and transcription of the P01130 gene . This over expression of the P01130 in the liver increases the clearance of circulating LDL thus decreasing the LDL-cholesterol plasma levels . The effects of fibrates on lipid metabolism are entirely due to their capacity to activate Q07869 and to induce the over expression of genes containing a PPRE in their promoter . Fibrates decrease triglyceride concentrations by increasing the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver and by decreasing triglyceride-VLDL synthesis . Fibrates also decrease triglycerides by increasing the hydolysys of triglycerides in chylomicron and VLDL through their capacity to increase and to decrease the lipoprotein lipase and the apo C-III transcription , respectively . Fibrates could decrease triglycerides partly by inducing apo A-V over-expression . These molecules increase HDL-cholesterol by increasing apo A-I and apo A-II transcription . Therefore the mechanisms of action of statins and fibrates depend on their capacity to modulate the expression of genes controlling lipoprotein metabolism . DB00099 -induced stem cell mobilization in chronic myeloid leukaemia patients during imatinib therapy : safety , feasibility and evidence for an efficient in vivo purging . Therapy with imatinib mesylate is limited by cellular resistance in chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . Further , the limited availability of matching stem cell donors or an unfavourable risk profile for allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) reduces the number of therapeutic options in a number of patients . To assess the possibility of stem cell mobilization ( DB00919 ) during imatinib therapy we performed granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim)-induced DB00919 and subsequent aphaeresis in 15 chronic phase and three accelerated phase CML patients . Aphaeresis was successful in 13 patients ( 72 % ) ( > or =2.0 x 10(6) P28906 + cells/kg body weight ) and five ( 28 % ) harvests could be obtained , which were negative for P11274 / P00519 mRNA as assessed by nested-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . All harvests , except one , were negative after first round RT-PCR , implicating a low level of CML cell contamination . There was no significant change in peripheral P11274 / P00519 transcript load after DB00919 as assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR . Fifteen patients remained stable in complete cytogenetic remission ( CCR ) during a median observation period of 9.3 months . One patient achieved a molecular remission shortly after DB00919 . Another patient who exhibited rising P11274 / P00519 mRNA levels before DB00919 achieved CCR after autologous P09683 with the generated harvest . One patient with a Philadelphia chromosome-negative , P11274 / P00519 -positive CML showed a cytogenetic relapse 6 months after DB00919 . We conclude that filgrastim-induced P28906 + cell aphaeresis under simultaneous imatinib medication is safe and feasible in CML patients . Additionally , we found evidence that this procedure could generate stem cell harvests that exhibit non-detectable levels of P11274 / P00519 mRNA . Growth inhibition in clonal subpopulations of a human epithelioid sarcoma cell line by retinoic acid and tumour necrosis factor alpha . Epithelioid sarcoma is a highly malignant soft tissue tumour that is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and irradiation . Since permanent cell lines of this tumour are extremely rare , in vitro data on compounds with significant antiproliferative effects are still lacking . Therefore , we investigated the effects of retinoic acid ( RA ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) on tumour cell proliferation of three different clonal subpopulations ( GRU-1A , GRU-1B , GRU-1C ) derived from the same human epithelioid sarcoma cell line , GRU-1 . In GRU-1A both RA ( P=0.01 ) and P01375 ( P=0.002 ) exhibited highly significant and dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects , which could further be increased by a combined application of both compounds ( P < 0.006 ) . GRU-1B proved to be sensitive to RA ( P=0.006 ) , whereas no response to P01375 was observed . GRU-1C was resistant to both RA and P01375 . The antiproliferative effect of P01375 was mediated by P01375 receptor 1( P19438 ) and correlated positively with both the number of P19438 per cell and receptor affinity . No correlation was detected between RA-induced growth inhibition and the expression pattern of the RA receptors ( RARs ) P10276 , P10826 , and P13631 . Plating efficiency , however , could exclusively be reduced by RA in GRU-1B , the only cell line expressing P10276 . Taken together , these data are the first showing significant antiproliferative effects in human epithelioid sarcoma by RA and P01375 . Whereas the P01375 response seems to depend on the expression of P19438 , no simple correlation could be found between RA sensitivity and the expression pattern of RARs . GVHD prophylaxis with sirolimus-tacrolimus may overcome the deleterious effect on survival of HLA mismatch after reduced-intensity conditioning allo- P09683 . Large studies , mostly based on series of patients receiving Q13216 /tacrolimus ( P51854 ) plus MTX as immunoprophylaxis , have demonstrated a deleterious effect on survival of the presence of a single mismatch out of eight loci after allogeneic hematopoietic P09683 ( alloHSCT ) . We retrospectively analyzed a series of 159 adult patients who received sirolimus( Q86TD4 )/ P51854 prophylaxis after alloHSCT . We compared overall outcomes according to HLA compatibility in A , B , C and Q8IUH3 loci at the allele level : 7/8 ( n=20 ) vs 8/8 ( n=139 ) . Donor type was unrelated in 95 % vs 70 % among 7/8 vs 8/8 pairs , respectively ( P=0.01 ) . No significant differences were observed in 3-year OS ( 68 vs 62 % ) , 3-year O43281 ( 53 vs 49 % ) and 1-year non-relapse mortality ( 9 vs 13 % ) . Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD ( aGVHD ) was significantly higher in 7/8 alloHSCT ( 68 % vs 42 % , P < 0.001 ) but no significant differences were found for III-IV aGVHD ( 4.5 % vs 11 % ) , overall ( 35 % vs 53 % ) and extensive ( 20 % vs 35 % ) chronic GHVD in 7/8 vs 8/8 subgroups , respectively . In summary , the present study indicates favorable outcomes after alloHSCT using the combination of Q86TD4 / P51854 combination as GVHD prophylaxis with OS in the range of 55-70 % , and non-significant differences in overall outcomes , irrespective of the presence of any mismatches at obligatory loci . Hepatic stellate cells undermine the allostimulatory function of liver myeloid dendritic cells via P40763 -dependent induction of P14902 . Hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) are critical for hepatic wound repair and tissue remodeling . They also produce cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to the maintenance of hepatic immune homeostasis and the inherent tolerogenicity of the liver . The functional relationship between HSCs and the professional migratory APCs in the liver , that is , dendritic cells ( DCs ) , has not been evaluated . In this article , we report that murine liver DCs colocalize with HSCs in vivo under normal , steady-state conditions , and cluster with HSCs in vitro . In vitro , HSCs secrete high levels of DC chemoattractants , such as MΙP-1α and P13500 , as well as cytokines that modulate DC activation , including P01375 -α , P05231 , and IL-1β . Culture of HSCs with conventional liver myeloid ( m ) DCs resulted in increased P05231 and P22301 secretion compared with that of either cell population alone . Coculture also resulted in enhanced expression of costimulatory ( P33681 , P42081 ) and coinhibitory ( Q9NZQ7 ) molecules on mDCs . P19526 -induced mDC maturation required cell-cell contact and could be blocked , in part , by neutralizing MΙP-1α or P13500 . P19526 -induced mDC maturation was dependent on activation of P40763 in mDCs and , in part , on P19526 -secreted P05231 . Despite upregulation of costimulatory molecules , mDCs conditioned by HSCs demonstrated impaired ability to induce allogeneic T cell proliferation , which was independent of Q9NZQ7 , but dependent upon P19526 -induced P40763 activation and subsequent upregulation of P14902 . In conclusion , by promoting P14902 expression , HSCs may act as potent regulators of liver mDCs and function to maintain hepatic homeostasis and tolerogenicity . Cordycepin suppresses P01375 -α-induced NF-κB activation by reducing p65 transcriptional activity , inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation , and blocking IKKγ ubiquitination . Cordycepin is reported to participate in multiple pharmacological activities including anti-tumor and anti-inflammation , and is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway . However , the detailed molecular mechanism of cordycepin in suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway remains ambiguous . In this study , we first analyzed the effect of cordycepin on NF-κB activity in P29320 -293T cells , and found that cordycepin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in P01375 -α-induced NF-κB activation . Although cordycepin did not block P01375 -α-induced nuclear translocation of p65 , high concentration of cordycepin reduced the DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of NF-κB . Moreover , cordycepin also inhibited IκBα phosphorylation so as to suppress the degradation of IκBα . Further investigation revealed that cordycepin suppressed IKKs-mediated NF-κB activation and inhibited the ubiquitination of IKKγ . In conclusion , cordycepin effectively inhibits NF-κB signaling through suppressing the activities of NF-κB , IκB and IKK . Thus , cordycepin may provide some potential therapeutic application in inflammation-associated disorders and cancer . Proteome-wide changes induced by the Hsp90 inhibitor , geldanamycin in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells . The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) affects the function of many oncogenic signaling proteins including nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( P06748 - Q9UM73 ) expressed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . While Q9UM73 -positive ALCL cells are sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor and the geldanamycin ( GA ) analog , 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17- P29372 ) , the proteomic effects of these drugs on Q9UM73 -positive ALCL cells are unpublished . In this study , we investigated the cellular , biologic , and proteomic changes occurring in Q9UM73 -positive ALCL cells in response to GA treatment . GA induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis . Furthermore , quantitative proteomic changes analyzed by cleavable isotope-coded affinity tag-LC-MS/MS ( cICAT-LC-MS/MS ) identified 176 differentially expressed proteins . Out of these , 49 were upregulated 1.5-fold or greater and 70 were downregulated 1.5-fold or greater in GA-treated cells . Analysis of biological functions of differentially expressed proteins revealed diverse changes , including induction of proteins involved in the 26S proteasome as well as downregulation of proteins involved in signal transduction and protein and nucleic acid metabolism . Pathway analysis revealed changes in MAPK , WNT , NF-kappaB , TGFbeta , Q07869 , and integrin signaling components . Our studies reveal some of the molecular and proteomic consequences of Hsp90 inhibition in Q9UM73 -positive ALCL cells and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of its diverse cellular effects . Glioma cell activation by Alzheimer 's peptide Abeta1-42 , alpha1-antichymotrypsin , and their mixture . We compared the effects ofAlzheimer 's peptide ( Abeta1-42 ) , a,-antichymotrypsin ( ACT ) and an ACT/Abeta1-42 mixture on human glioma DK-MG cells . The solution of Abeta ( 5 microM ) formed by 2-h incubation at room temperature induced tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) and interleukin ( IL ) -6 levels by 55 and 45 % , respectively , and increased gelatinase B activity by 67 % , while exposure of cells to the ACT/Abeta1-42 mixture ( 1:10 molar ratio ACT : Abeta1-42 ) under the same experimental conditions showed no effect on P05231 levels or gelatinase B activity , but strongly induced P01375 ( by 190 % ) , compared to the controls . Stimulation of the cells with Abeta1-42 alone , but not with ACT , increased by about 20 % low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) uptake and mRNA levels for P01130 and P04035 , while the ACT/Abeta1-42 mixture significantly increased LDL uptake ( by 50 % ) , up-regulated mRNA levels for P01130 and P04035 by 48 and 63 % , respectively , and increased lipid accumulation by about 20-fold . These data suggest a possible new role for Abeta in Alzheimer 's disease through its interaction with the inflammatory reactant , ACT . Gating properties of Q14524 mutations and the response to mexiletine in long-QT syndrome type 3 patients . BACKGROUND : DB00379 ( Mex ) has been proposed as a gene-specific therapy for patients with long-QT syndrome type 3 ( LQT3 ) caused by mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene ( Q14524 ) . The degree of QT shortening and the protection from arrhythmias vary among patients harboring different mutations . We tested whether the clinical response to Mex in LQT3 could be predicted by the biophysical properties of the different mutations . METHODS AND RESULTS : We identified 4 Q14524 mutations in 5 symptomatic LQT3 patients with different responses to Mex ( 6 to 8 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) ) . We classified the mutations as sensitive to Mex ( P1332L , R1626P ; >/= 10 % of QTc shortening and QTc < 500 ms or no arrhythmias ) or insensitive to Mex ( S941N , M1652R ; negligible or no QTc shortening and sudden death ) . We measured Na(+) current from P29320 293 cells transfected with wild-type ( WT ) or mutant Nav1.5 . All mutations showed impaired inactivation of Na(+) current , but the mutations identified in patient responders to Mex ( P1332L , R1626P ) showed a hyperpolarizing shift of V(1/2) of steady-state inactivation . Furthermore , Mex produced use-dependent block with the order R1626P=P1332L > S941N=WT > M1652R , suggesting that Mex-sensitive mutants present prolonged recovery from Mex block . CONCLUSIONS : We propose that voltage dependence of channel availability and shifts of V(1/2) of steady-state inactivation correlate with the clinical response observed in LQT3 patients . This supports the view that the response to Mex is mutation specific and that in vitro testing may help to predict the response to therapy in LQT3 . P06748 -RAR , not the RAR- P06748 reciprocal t(5;17)(q35;q21) acute promyelocytic leukemia fusion protein , inhibits myeloid differentiation . The t(5;17) variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) fuses the nucleophosmin ( P06748 ) gene at 5q35 with the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( P10276 ) at 17q12-22 . We have previously shown that leukemic cells express both P06748 -RAR and RAR- P06748 reciprocal translocation products . In this study we investigated the potential role of both proteins in modulating myeloid differentiation . Expression of P06748 -RAR inhibited vitamin D3/transforming growth factor β ( TGFβ ) -mediated differentiation of U937 cells by more than 50 % . In contrast , RAR- P06748 expression did not alter vitamin D3/TGFβ-induced differentiation of U937 clones . These results indicate that P06748 -RAR , not RAR- P06748 , is the prime mediator of myeloid differentiation arrest in t(5;17) APL . Molecular and biologic characterization of a newly established Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line ( Z-33 ) with an autocrine response to GM- P04141 . We have recently established a new Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph1 ) -positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cell line , designated Z-33 . This line has Q401N2 morphology , ultrastructural characteristics of lymphoblasts and typical B lineage surface markers identical to those observed in the Ph1-positive ALL patient from whom the line was derived . In addition , a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene ( JH ) band was found in Z-33 cells by Southern blot analysis , confirming B cell clonality . Cytogenetic analysis of the cell line revealed t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -amplified cDNA from Z-33 cells demonstrated an e1-az P11274 - P00519 junction , and the p190BCR- P00519 protein was detected in them by the immune complex kinase assay . Z-33 cells produce interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta , P05231 , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) , granulocyte-macrophage P04141 ( GM- P04141 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , and transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta , Neither P01584 , DB00099 , P01375 , nor their corresponding antibodies affected the cell line 's growth . In contrast , anti-GM- P04141 neutralizing antibodies suppressed Z-33 colony formation , and GM- P04141 stimulated it in a dose-dependent fashion . In addition , receptor studies with biotinylated GM- P04141 demonstrated specific binding to Z-33 cells , indicating that the cells express GM- P04141 receptors . Taken together , our data suggest that the Ph1-positive Z-33 ALL cells produce GM- P04141 , express GM- P04141 receptors , and show an autocrine proliferative response to this cytokine . Augmentation of methamphetamine-induced behaviors in transgenic mice lacking the trace amine-associated receptor 1 . The trace amine-associated receptor 1 ( Q96RJ0 ) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is functionally activated by amphetamine-based psychostimulants , including amphetamine , methamphetamine and DB01454 . Previous studies have shown that in transgenic mice lacking the Q96RJ0 gene ( Q96RJ0 knockout ; KO ) a single injection of amphetamine can produce enhanced behavioral responses compared to responses evoked in wild-type ( WT ) mice . Further , the psychostimulant effects of cocaine can be diminished by selective activation of Q96RJ0 . These findings suggest that Q96RJ0 might be implicated in the rewarding properties of psychostimulants . To investigate the role of Q96RJ0 in the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse , the psychomotor stimulating effects of amphetamine and methamphetamine and the conditioned rewarding effects of methamphetamine and morphine were compared between WT and Q96RJ0 KO mice . In locomotor activity studies , both single and repeated exposure to DB01576 or methamphetamine generated significantly higher levels of total distance traveled in Q96RJ0 KO mice compared to WT mice . In conditioned place preference ( CPP ) studies , Q96RJ0 KO mice acquired methamphetamine-induced CPP earlier than WT mice and retained CPP longer during extinction training . In morphine-induced CPP , both WT and KO genotypes displayed similar levels of CPP . Results from locomotor activity studies suggest that Q96RJ0 may have a modulatory role in the behavioral sensitization to amphetamine-based psychostimulants . That methamphetamine-but not morphine-induced CPP was augmented in Q96RJ0 KO mice suggests a selective role of Q96RJ0 in the conditioned reinforcing effects of methamphetamine . Collectively , these findings provide support for a regulatory role of Q96RJ0 in methamphetamine signaling . Prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD : EBMT- P15502 working group recommendations for a standardized practice . GVHD remains the major impediment to broader application of allogeneic haematopoietic P09683 . It can be prevented completely , but at the expense of other complications , rejection , relapse or delayed immune reconstitution . No optimal prevention or treatment method has been defined . This is reflected by enormous heterogeneity in approaches in Europe . Retrospective comparisons between different policies , although warranted , do not give definite answers . In order to improve the present situation , an European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the European LeukemiaNet working group has developed in a Delphi-like approach recommendations for prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD in the most common allogeneic transplant setting , transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor for standard risk malignant disease . The working group proposes these guidelines to be adopted as routine standard in transplantation centres and to be used as comparator in systematic studies evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of practices differing from these recommendations . Subclones with the t(9;22)/ P11274 - P00519 rearrangement occur in AML and seem to cooperate with distinct genetic alterations . In AML , cooperation of mutations suppressing differentiation ( ' class-II-mutations ' ) with ' class-I-mutations ' increasing cell proliferation is frequent . In rare cases of myeloid malignancies , the P11274 - P00519 fusion was reported to cooperate as class-I-mutation with class-II-mutations , but most cases had to be classified as blast phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . We identified five cases of Philadelphia positive subclones in AML occurring in coincidence with other genetic lesions : 1:220 patients with inv(16)/ Q13951 - P35749 ( 0·5 % ) , 2:272 AML cases with t(8;21)/ Q01196 - Q06455 ( 0·7 % ) , 1:1029 P06748 -mutated AML ( 0·1 % ) , and one patient with s-AML following P43034 with a 5q-deletion . Four patients had m- P11274 ( e1a2 ) P11274 - P00519 transcripts ; one case only had an M- P11274 ( b3a2 ) breakpoint . These cases allow some interesting conclusions : The P11274 - P00519 rearrangement apparently can cooperate with the P06748 mutation similar to other class-I-mutations . The identification of Philadelphia positive subclones in < 1 % of patients with Q03701 -leukaemias fits well with previous observations that most Q03701 -AML are accompanied by activating mutations in genes enhancing proliferation . Since we observed the occurrence of the Philadelphia positive subclones at diagnosis , at relapse , or throughout the disease , the time point of the emergence of Philadelphia subclones seems variable in AML . Clinical research should further concentrate on Philadelphia positive subclones in AML to assess the clinical impact . Clinical impact of Q9Y6K1 mutations in younger adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia : results of the AML Study Group ( AMLSG ) . In this study , we evaluated the frequency and prognostic impact of Q9Y6K1 mutations ( Q9Y6K1 (mut) ) in 1770 younger adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) in the context of other genetic alterations and the European LeukemiaNet ( P15502 ) classification . Q9Y6K1 (mut) were found in 20.9 % of AMLs and were associated with older age ( P < .0001 ) , higher white blood cell counts ( P < .0001 ) , cytogenetically normal AML ( CN-AML ; P < .0001 ) , P06748 mutations ( P < .0001 ) , P36888 internal tandem duplications ( P < .0001 ) , and O75874 /2 mutations ( P < .0001 ) . In univariable and multivariable analyses , Q9Y6K1 (mut) did not impact event-free , relapse-free ( RFS ) , or overall survival ( OS ) in either the entire cohort or in CN-AML ; a negative prognostic effect was found only in the P15502 unfavorable CN-AML subset ( OS , P = .011 ) . In addition , R882 mutations vs non-R882 mutations showed opposite clinical effects-unfavorable for R882 on RFS ( all : hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.29 [ P = .026 ] ; CN-AML : HR , 1.38 [ P = .018 ] ) and favorable for non-R882 on OS ( all : HR , 0.77 [ P = .057 ] ; CN-AML : HR , 0.73 [ P = .083 ] ) . In our statistically high-powered study with minimized selection bias , Q9Y6K1 (mut) represent a frequent genetic lesion in younger adults with AML but have no significant impact on survival end points ; only moderate effects on outcome were found , depending on molecular subgroup and Q9Y6K1 (mut) type . [ DB00707 sodium ( Photofrin-II ) ] . DB00707 sodium ( DB00707 ) is a photosensitizer which distributes selectively to tumor tissues , and causes tumor cell death by combination with light irradiation . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) by combination of porfimer sodium and laser was developed as a new cancer therapy . Tumor selectivity of porfimer sodium are based on the following reasons ; 1 ) high affinity for lipoprotein , especially , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , 2 ) elevation of P01130 activity in cancer tissue , and 3 ) lack or imcompleteness of lymphatic system in cancer tissue . DB00707 sodium is activated by laser irradiation at 630 nm , which can reacts with tissue oxygen to produce highly reactive excited siglet oxygen ( 1O2 ) . This highly reactive molecule is subsequently capable of killing tumor cells through oxidation of cellular component like mitochondrial enzymes . In addition , this highly reactive intermediate causes destruction of the tumor capillaries , which accelerates tumor cell death . The growth suppression or lethal damage to tumor cells by PDT of porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser were observed in experimental tumor models . In human clinical trials , the rates of complete response ( CR ) for roentgenographically occult lung cancer , stage I lung cancer , superficial esophageal cancer , superficial gastric cancer and carcinoma in situ or dysplasia of the cervix were 84.8 % , 50.0 % , 90.0 % , 87.5 % and 94.4 % , respectively . The major side effects were cutaneous symptoms e.g. photosensitivity , pigmentation , increasing GOT , GPT but these symptoms were not severe . PDT using porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser must be clinically useful for the treatment of inoperable early cancer or conservation of organ functions . Microtubule-depolymerizing agents used in antibody-drug conjugates induce antitumor immunity by stimulation of dendritic cells . Antibody-drug conjugates ( ADC ) are emerging as powerful treatment strategies with outstanding target-specificity and high therapeutic activity in patients with cancer . DB08870 represents a first-in-class ADC directed against P28908 (+) malignancies . We hypothesized that its sustained clinical responses could be related to the stimulation of an anticancer immune response . In this study , we demonstrate that the dolastatin family of microtubule inhibitors , from which the cytotoxic component of brentuximab vedotin is derived , comprises potent inducers of phenotypic and functional dendritic cell ( DC ) maturation . In addition to the direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells , dolastatins efficiently promoted antigen uptake and migration of tumor-resident DCs to the tumor-draining lymph nodes . Exposure of murine and human DCs to dolastatins significantly increased their capacity to prime T cells . Underlining the requirement of an intact host immune system for the full therapeutic benefit of dolastatins , the antitumor effect was far less pronounced in immunocompromised mice . We observed substantial therapeutic synergies when combining dolastatins with tumor antigen-specific vaccination or blockade of the P18621 - Q9NZQ7 and P16410 coinhibitory pathways . Ultimately , treatment with ADCs using dolastatins induces DC homing and activates cellular antitumor immune responses in patients . Our data reveal a novel mechanism of action for dolastatins and provide a strong rationale for clinical treatment regimens combining dolastatin-based therapies , such as brentuximab vedotin , with immune-based therapies . DB08870 followed by allogeneic transplantation as salvage regimen in patients with relapsed and/or refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma ( RR-HL ) have poor outcomes . DB08870 ( BV ) , an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an anti- P28908 antibody conjugated to the potent anti-microtubule agent , monomethyl auristatin E , induces high tumour responses with moderate adverse effects . In a retrospective study , we describe objective response rates and subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo- P09683 ) in patients with RR-HL treated by BV in a named patient program in two French institutions . Twenty-four adult patients with histologically proven P28908 (+) RR-HL treated with BV were included from July 2009 to November 2012 . Response to BV treatment was evaluated after four cycles . Eleven patients were in complete response ( 45.8 % ) , while five patients were in partial response ( 20.8 % ) , with an overall response rate of 66.6 % . Eight patients failed to respond to BV ( 33.3 % ) . All of the responding patients could receive consolidation treatment after BV : three patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation ( auto- P09683 ) , three patients received a tandem auto- P09683 /allo- P09683 , nine patients received allo- P09683 and one patient was treated with donor lymphocyte infusion . We found no treatment-related mortality at day 100 among the 12 patients who underwent BV following by allogeneic transplantation . With a median follow-up of 20 months ( range 10.5-43.2 ) , none of them relapsed or died . BV followed by allo- P09683 represents an effective salvage regimen in patients with RR-HL . [ Signal transduction inhibitor -- STI571 -- a new treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , which opens a new targeted approach to cancer therapy ] . Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , in most of the cases , is the molecular consequence of the t(9,22) translocation , resulting in the Philadelphia ( Ph ) chromosome and the creation of the fusion gene P11274 - P00519 . The fusion gene is translated to the protooncogen P11274 - P00519 , a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is linked to the malignant transformation . Thus , this tyrosine kinase became an attractive target for drug design . The development of the novel investigational drug DB00619 is based on its potent and selective ability to inhibit this fusion tyrosine kinase . In preclinical studies , DB00619 selectively inhibited the growth of CML cells that carry the Ph chromosome . In this review we discuss the drug development and design , its mechanism of action , the preclinical studies and the results of phase I and II clinical trials . Results of a pivotal phase II study of brentuximab vedotin for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma . PURPOSE : DB08870 is an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) that selectively delivers monomethyl auristatin E , an antimicrotubule agent , into P28908 -expressing cells . In phase I studies , brentuximab vedotin demonstrated significant activity with a favorable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory P28908 -positive lymphomas . PATIENTS AND METHODS : In this multinational , open-label , phase II study , the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin were evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) after autologous stem-cell transplantation ( auto- P09683 ) . Patients had histologically documented P28908 -positive HL by central pathology review . A total of 102 patients were treated with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks . In the absence of disease progression or prohibitive toxicity , patients received a maximum of 16 cycles . The primary end point was the overall objective response rate ( ORR ) determined by an independent radiology review facility . RESULTS : The ORR was 75 % with complete remission ( CR ) in 34 % of patients . The median progression-free survival time for all patients was 5.6 months , and the median duration of response for those in CR was 20.5 months . After a median observation time of more than 1.5 years , 31 patients were alive and free of documented progressive disease . The most common treatment-related adverse events were peripheral sensory neuropathy , nausea , fatigue , neutropenia , and diarrhea . CONCLUSION : The ADC brentuximab vedotin was associated with manageable toxicity and induced objective responses in 75 % of patients with relapsed or refractory HL after auto- P09683 . Durable CRs approaching 2 years were observed , supporting study in earlier lines of therapy . DB00227 -stimulated superinduction of P16581 , P05362 and P19320 in P01375 activated human vascular endothelial cells . Inhibitors of P04035 ( statins ) reveal important pharmacological effects in addition to reducing the plasma LDL cholesterol level . In the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis , transendothelial migration of various leukocytes including monocytes is a crucial step . We , therefore , investigated the expression of P16581 , intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P19320 ) in vascular endothelial cells as influenced by lovastatin . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) express significant amounts of selectins and cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) within a few hours after stimulation with P01375 . This effect is potentiated by 100-200 % when the cells are pretreated with 0.1-2.5 microM lovastatin . The lovastatin-mediated increase in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface is dose-dependent and significant at lovastatin concentrations comparable to plasma levels in patients under lovastatin treatment . The lovastatin-potentiated increase of P16581 and CAMs is correlated with a corresponding increase of selectin- and P62158 -specific mRNA . We conclude that , in vivo , statin treatment could trigger an enhanced recruitment of macrophages that might support the cholesteryl ester efflux from the arteriosclerotic plaque . [ Functional characteristics of calcium-sensitive adenylyl cyclase of ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis ] . DB01373 -sensitive forms of adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) were revealed in most vertebrates and invertebrates and also in some unicellular organisms , in particular ciliates . We have shown for the first time that calcium cations influence the AC activity of ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis . These cations at the concentrations of 0.2-20 microM stimulated the enzyme activity , and maximum of catalytic effect was observed at 2 microM Ca2+ . DB01373 cations at a concentrations of 100 microM or higher inhibited the AC activity . P62158 antagonists W-5 and W-7 at the concentrations of 20-100 microM inhibited the catalytic effect induced by 5 microM Ca2+ and blocked the effect at higher concentrations of Ca2+ . DB00477 , another calmodulin antagonist , reduced Ca2+-stimulated AC activity only at the concentrations of 200-1000 microM . AC stimulating effects of serotonin , P01133 and DB02527 increased in the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ . AC stimulating effects of P01133 , DB02527 and insulin decreased in the presence of 100 microM Ca2+ , and AC stimulating effect of DB02527 decreased also in the presence of calmodulin antagonists ( 1 mM ) . At the same time , stimulating effect of D-glucose in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin antagonists did not change essentially . The data obtained speak in favor of the presence of calcium-sensitive forms of AC in ciliate T. pyriformis which mediate enzyme stimulation by P01133 , DB02527 , insulin , and serotonin . Role of Q14116 in overt pain-like behaviour in mice . There are evidences that targeting Q14116 might be beneficial to inhibit inflammatory symptoms , including hypernociception ( decrease in nociceptive threshold ) . The mechanism of Q14116 mechanical hypernociception depends on endothelin in rats and mice . However , the role of Q14116 in overt pain-like behaviour remains undetermined . Therefore , we addressed the role of Q14116 in writhing response induced by intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection of phenyl-p-benzoquinone ( PBQ ) and acetic acid in mice . Firstly , it was detected that PBQ and acetic acid i.p. injection induced a dose-dependent number of writhes in Balb/c mice . Subsequently , it was observed that the PBQ - but not the acetic acid-induced writhes were diminished in Q14116 deficient ( ( -/- ) ) mice . Therefore , considering that P01579 , endothelin and prostanoids mediate Q14116 -induced mechanical hypernociception , we also investigated the role of these mediators in the same model of writhing response in which Q14116 participates . It was noticed that PBQ-induced writhes were diminished in P01579 (-/-) mice and by the treatment with DB00559 ( mixed endothelin P25101 /ETB receptor antagonist ) , BQ 123 ( cyclo[DTrp-DAsp-Pro-DVal- DB00149 ] , selective endothelin P25101 receptor antagonist ) , BQ 788 ( N-cys-2,6 dimethylpiperidinocarbonyl-l-methylleucyl-d-1-methoxycarboyl-d-norleucine , selective endothelin ETB receptor antagonist ) or indomethacin ( cycloxigenase inhibitor ) . Thus , Q14116 , P01579 , endothelin acting on endothelin P25101 and ETB receptors , and prostanoids mediate PBQ-induced writhing response in mice . To conclude , these results further advance the understanding of the physiopathology of overt pain-like behaviour , and suggest for the first time a role for Q14116 in writhing response in mice . Malignant transformation of P01730 + T lymphocytes mediated by oncogenic kinase P06748 / Q9UM73 recapitulates P60568 -induced cell signaling and gene expression reprogramming . Q9UM73 ( Q9UM73 ) , physiologically expressed only by nervous system cells , displays a remarkable capacity to transform P01730 (+) T lymphocytes and other types of nonneural cells . In this study , we report that activity of nucleophosmin ( P06748 ) / Q9UM73 chimeric protein , the dominant form of Q9UM73 expressed in T cell lymphomas ( TCLs ) , closely resembles cell activation induced by P60568 , the key cytokine supporting growth and survival of normal P01730 (+) T lymphocytes . Direct comparison of gene expression by Q9UM73 (+) Q9H4E5 cells treated with an Q9UM73 inhibitor and P60568 -dependent Q9UM73 (-) Q9H4E5 cells stimulated with the cytokine revealed a very similar , albeit inverse , gene-regulation pattern . Depending on the analysis method , up to 67 % of the affected genes were modulated in common by P06748 / Q9UM73 and P60568 . Based on the gene expression patterns , Jak/ P35610 - and P60568 -signaling pathways topped the list of pathways identified as affected by both P60568 and P06748 / Q9UM73 . The expression dependence on P06748 / Q9UM73 and P60568 of the five selected genes-CD25 ( IL-2Rα ) , Egr-1 , Fosl-1 , O14543 , and Irf-4-was confirmed at the protein level . In both Q9UM73 (+) Q9H4E5 and P60568 -stimulated Q9UM73 (-) Q9H4E5 cells , CD25 , O14543 , and Irf-4 genes were activated predominantly by the P42229 and P40763 transcription factors , whereas transcription of Egr-1 and Fosl-1 was induced by the MEK- P29323 pathway . Finally , we found that Egr-1 , a protein not associated previously with either P60568 or Q9UM73 , contributes to the cell proliferation . These findings indicate that P06748 / Q9UM73 transforms the target P01730 (+) T lymphocytes , at least in part , by using the pre-existing , P60568 -dependent signaling pathways . Quantitative study of the interactome of PKCζ involved in the P01133 -induced tumor cell chemotaxis . Chemotaxis plays an important role in metastasis . In our previous studies , we reported that protein kinase C ζ ( PKCζ ) mediated cancer cell chemotaxis by regulating cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell adhesion . To further study the molecular mechanism of chemotaxis , mass spectrometry-based approaches were employed to investigate the interactome of PKCζ and its changes upon stimulation by epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) . As a result , 233 proteins were identified as potential PKCζ binding partners . Label free quantification was applied to examine the quantitative changes of these interactions involved in the P01133 induced chemotaxis . Fifteen identified proteins were enriched and 9 proteins were reduced in the presence of P01133 ( ≥ 1.5 folds , p ≤ 0.05 ) . The interaction between cofilin-1 ( P23528 ) and PKCζ was evidenced and this interaction was enhanced in the P01133 induced chemotaxis signaling transduction . In addition , novel PKCζ interacting proteins potentially related with chemotaxis were characterized , such as isoform 1 of nucleophosmin ( P06748 ) . Furthermore , Western blotting and chemotaxis assays were also applied to validate the proteomics result and explore its biological implications . Collectively , the combination of quantitative proteomics and biological assays provides a powerful strategy for elucidating the signaling pathway of tumor cell chemotaxis . Influence of a 3-day regimen of azithromycin on the disposition kinetics of cyclosporine A in stable renal transplant patients . Some macrolide antibiotics have been shown to produce significant drug-drug interactions through the inhibition of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes . In renal transplant patients these interactions pose potentially serious problems for the safe administration of cyclosporine A ( Q13216 ) , a substrate of P08684 . The effects of azithromycin on Q13216 disposition kinetics were evaluated in eight stable renal transplant patients . Patients had been stabilized on individualized doses of Q13216 which remained unchanged throughout the study . DB00207 was administered for 3 days . Baseline measurements of Q13216 disposition kinetics were taken prior to azithromycin treatment ( study day 2 ) and after 3 days ( study day 5 ) of azithromycin treatment ( 500mg/day , orally ) . The key parameters of interest were the area under the Q13216 blood concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) measured for 24h after the morning dose of Q13216 on both days 2 and 5 , and the C(max) values of Q13216 . The geometric mean ratios ( GMRs ) of those parameters ( day 5/day 2 ) and their 90 % confidence intervals ( 90 % CI ) were 107 ( 98,116 ) and 119 ( 104,136 ) , respectively . The 7 % increase in exposure level and 19 % increase in peak plasma concentration are not likely to be clinically significant . It is concluded that azithromycin ( 500mg/dayx3 days ) does not alter the disposition kinetics of Q13216 in a clinically significant way , and that Q13216 dosage adjustments are not warranted in renal transplant patients taking these two drugs together . Activity of retinoic acid receptor-gamma selectively binding retinoids alone and in combination with interferon-gamma in breast cancer cell lines . Retinoids modulate several cell functions and especially inhibit the growth of a wide variety of cells including breast cancer . Retinoic acid receptor-gamma ( P13631 ) has been shown to mediate the antiproliferative activity of retinoids . To further test this hypothesis we examined the effects of different P13631 selectively binding retinoids ( CD2325 , CD2247 , CD666 and CD437 ) on breast cancer cell lines . With exception of CD2247 , all retinoids inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 , SKBR-3 , T47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines , similar to the natural compound all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) . In addition , all 4 compounds were able to act synergistically with interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) in all breast cancer cell lines including the retinoid-resistant BT-20 and 734-B lines . In functional transactivation assays we demonstrated that only in the MCF-7 cell line , TPA-mediated AP-1 activity was suppressed only by DB00755 and CD2325 , whereas in SKBR-3 , another RA-sensitive breast cancer cell line , it was not . The synergistic antiproliferative activity involving retinoids and P01579 could not be explained by an enhanced anti-AP-1 activity . No correlation was found between expression of RARs and cellular retinoic acid binding proteins ( CRABPs ) and antiproliferative effects of the retinoids . P13631 selectively binding retinoids are potent inhibitors of breast cancer cell proliferation , alone and in combination with P01579 . For this reason and because of a possible low toxicity , as compared with retinoic acid , we speculate that these P13631 selective binding retinoids might be of clinical importance . [ Cutaneous non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection following cord blood stem cell transplantation ] . We describe a 4-year-old-girl with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( FHL ) who developed disseminated cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial ( Q9P121 ) infection after unrelated cord blood stem cell transplantation ( uCBSCT ) . After transplantation , the patient developed steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease , and was given methylprednisolone , cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil . Six months after uCBSCT , cutaneous lesions that looked like insect bites appeared and spread widely over the thighs . Q9P121 infection was diagnosed by skin biopsy although no organism could be identified . DB01017 ( MINO ) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim ( ST ) were administered . However , the cutaneous disease followed a course of remissions and exacerbations . One month after the skin biopsy , mycobacterium chelonae was detected by bacteriological culture of abscess drainage . Ten months after uCBSCT , the cutaneous lesions quickly progressed and the inguinal lymph nodes became enlarged and painful . Then the antibiotics were switched from MINO and ST to amikacin and clarithromycin ( P62158 ) based on the results of mycobacterial susceptibility test . The cutaneous lesions gradually improved after continuous administration of P62158 . Cutaneous Q9P121 infection is rare , but it may occur in immunocompromised patients after P09683 . P16410 ( P16410 ) modulates the Th subset response and alters the course of experimental Leishmania major infection . Since both the nature and the amplitude of an antigen-specific T cell response are dependent on co-stimulatory signals , we have investigated the role of P10747 / P16410 -mediated T cell co-stimulation in the regulation of experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis . P10747 -deficient mice and their wild-type littermates are equally susceptible to Leishmania major infection . Whole anti- P16410 antibody significantly exacerbates the disease while anti- P16410 Fab ameliorates the disease in genetically susceptible BALB/c mice but not in C57BL/6 , a resistant strain . The anti- P16410 -induced exacerbation of the disease is accompanied by increased P05112 -secreting cell number , diminished parasite-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response and augmented anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl ( TNP ) IgG1 in response to TNP-leishmanial antigen crude soluble antigen ( Q13216 ) , suggesting an exaggerated Th2 type of response . Anti- P16410 Fab-mediated amelioration of the disease is associated with increased P01579 -secreting cell number , increased parasite-specific DTH response and enhanced IgG2a isotype in response to TNP- Q13216 suggesting a Th1 type of response . Unlike TNP- Q13216 , TNP- DB05299 does not induce the change in Ig isotype , indicating that the immunomodulatory effect of anti- P16410 is antigen specific . Anti- P16410 antibody-induced early change in Th subsets suggests an important role for P16410 in determining the course of L. major infection , perhaps by alteration of Th subset differentiation . Expression of vitamin D3 receptor and retinoid receptors in human breast cancer : identification of potential heterodimeric receptors . DB00169 ( VD ) and all-trans-retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) have been postulated as a novel treatment option for breast carcinoma . Since the combined effects of retinoids and VD derivatives are attributed to heterodimeric interactions between members of the nuclear receptor family , the expression patterns of the heterodimers formed by vitamin D3 receptor ( P11473 ) and the retinoid receptors RARs ( P10276 , P10826 and P13631 ) and RXRs ( RXR-alpha , RXR-beta and RXR-gamma ) have been studied by immunohistochemistry in benign and malignant breast tissues . Present results revealed that immunoexpressions to all receptor types studied were higher in both in situ and infiltrative carcinomas than in benign breast diseases . In a variable number of cases of infiltrative carcinoma , immunostaining appeared in the nucleus , whereas in the other two disorders immunostaining was only cytoplasmic . The correlation established between P11473 and the different isoforms of retinoid receptors revealed that P11473 seems to select mainly P10276 to form heterodimers and to exert their properties as transcription factor . The results of this study suggest that this heterodimer plays a critical role in cancer malignancy , and its presence indicates those patient groups presenting a better response to adjuvant therapies based on the combination of vitamin D and DB00755 . Interaction of murine peritoneal leukocytes and mesothelial cells : in vitro model system to survey cellular events on serosal membranes during inflammation . All serosal cavities including peritoneum are lined with a simple squamous mesothelium . Primary culture of murine mesothelial cells has been established to study their cellular interactions with peritoneal leukocytes . The mesothelial character was determined by the cytokeratin and vimentin expression . The mesothelial cells expressed P05362 and P16070 molecules . The expression of P05362 , but not P16070 , was significantly enhanced by the treatment with P01375 ( 100 U/ml ) . We have also investigated possible influence of transforming growth factors , TGF-alpha ( 20 ng/ml ) and TGF-beta ( 2 ng/ml ) , and epidermal growth factor ( 20 ng/ml ) . These factors were not found to modulate P05362 or P16070 expression in vitro . During coculture experiments unstimulated mesothelial cells were almost nonadherent for both resident and elicited peritoneal mononuclear leukocytes for several hours . P01375 or P01133 pretreatment of mesothelial cells greatly enhanced their adhesive affinity to peritoneal mononuclear leukocytes , while TGF-beta pretreatment even reduced the low basal adhesion . Prolonged coculture for 3 weeks resulted in remarkable proliferation and differentiation of both resident and elicited monocytes/macrophages on the mesothelial surface . The stimulation of mesothelial cell culture with P01133 resulted in the macrophage colony-stimulating activity ( M- Q13216 ) production . M- Q13216 was mainly due to P09603 as confirmed with anti P09603 monoclonal antibody ; the residual M- Q13216 was not formed by GM- P04141 . After several passages the mesothelial cells started to produce M- Q13216 spontaneously . Scutellarein Reduces Inflammatory Responses by Inhibiting Src Kinase Activity . Flavonoids are plant pigments that have been demonstrated to exert various pharmacological effects including anti-cancer , anti-diabetic , anti-atherosclerotic , anti-bacterial , and anti-inflammatory activities . However , the molecular mechanisms in terms of exact target proteins of flavonoids are not fully elucidated yet . In this study , we aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of scutellarein ( P09683 ) , a flavonoid isolated from Erigeron breviscapus , Clerodendrum phlomidis and Oroxylum indicum Vent that have been traditionally used to treat various inflammatory diseases in China and Brazil . For this purpose , a nitric oxide ( NO ) assay , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , nuclear fractionation , immunoblot analysis , a kinase assay , and an overexpression strategy were employed . Scutellarein significantly inhibited NO production in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the mRNA expression levels of inducible NO synthase ( P35228 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -activated RAW264.7 cells . In addition , P09683 also dampened nuclear factor ( NF ) -κB-driven expression of a luciferase reporter gene upon transfection of a TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β ( Q8IUC6 ) construct into Human embryonic kidney 293 ( P29320 293 ) cells ; similarly , NF-κ B nuclear translocation was inhibited by P09683 . Moreover , the phosphorylation levels of various upstream signaling enzymes involved in NF-κB activation were decreased by P09683 treatment in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells . Finally , P09683 strongly inhibited Src kinase activity and also inhibited the autophosphorylation of overexpressed Src . Therefore , our data suggest that P09683 can block the inflammatory response by directly inhibiting Src kinase activity linked to NF-κB activation . Q07869 - γ Regulates Trophoblast Differentiation in the BeWo Cell Model . Common pregnancy complications , such as severe preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction , disrupt pregnancy progression and impair maternal and fetal wellbeing . Placentas from such pregnancies exhibit lesions principally within the syncytiotrophoblast ( P09683 ) , a layer in direct contact with maternal blood . In humans and mice , glial cell missing-1 ( GCM-1 ) promotes differentiation of underlying cytotrophoblast cells into the outer P09683 layer . GCM-1 may be regulated by the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( Q07869 - γ ) ; in mice , Q07869 - γ promotes labyrinthine trophoblast differentiation via Gcm-1 , and , as we previously demonstrated , Q07869 - γ activation ameliorates disease features in rat model of preeclampsia . Here , we aimed to characterize the baseline activity of Q07869 - γ in the human choriocarcinoma BeWo cell line that mimics P09683 formation in vitro and modulate Q07869 - γ activity to study its effects on cell proliferation versus differentiation . We report a novel negative autoregulatory mechanism between Q07869 - γ activity and expression and show that blocking Q07869 - γ activity induces cell proliferation at the expense of differentiation , while these remain unaltered following treatment with the agonist rosiglitazone . Gaining a deeper understanding of the role and activity of Q07869 - γ in placental physiology will offer new avenues for the development of secondary prevention and/or treatment options for placentally-mediated pregnancy complications . Respective role of humoral factors and blood pressure in aortic remodeling of DOCA hypertensive rats . Hypertension results in increased thickness and stiffness of large artery walls . The goal of our study was to assess the respective roles of humoral factors such as Ang II , endothelin and blood pressure in these aortic modifications . For this purpose , uninephrectomized rats received DOCA and high salt diet , and when hypertension was installed , they were treated for 5 weeks with either a long-acting calcium antagonist , mibefradil ( 30 mg/kg/day ) , an P12821 inhibitor , enalapril ( 3 mg/kg/day ) , or a mixed P25101 and ETB endothelin receptor antagonist , DB00559 ( 100 mg/kg/day ) . A group of hypertensive rats was left untreated and a sham-operated group of normotensive rats was used for control . At the end of treatment , aortic medial thickness and elastin as well as collagen were evaluated by quantitative morphometry . DOCA-salt hypertensive rats exhibited a marked increase in medial thickness associated with no change in absolute content in extracellular matrix . P15502 relative density decreased in DOCA rats . Enalapril had no effect on arterial pressure . DB00559 decreased slightly ( by 12 mm Hg ) , but not significantly , blood pressure . None of these drugs had an effect on medial thickness suggesting that in DOCA hypertensive rats neither Ang II nor endothelin play a significant role in the remodeling of the aorta . In contrast , mibefradil almost normalized arterial pressure , prevented medial hypertrophy and increased elastin density . Further studies are required in order to assess if this effect is directly linked to the blood pressure decrease or to another mechanism related to the calcium antagonistic property of mibefradil . Microenvironment of the murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 : endogenous P01579 affects tumor phenotype , growth , and metastasis . P01579 has a profound influence on growth and metastasis of solid tumors . This is true for the murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 which grows faster and metastasizes much more readily when transplanted into the mammary fatpads of P01579 (-/-) mice . We were interested in determining which infiltrating hematopoietic cells produce P01579 within the 4T1 tumor microenvironment . 4T1 tumors were infiltrated with progressively increasing numbers of F4/80(+)/CD11c(+) myeloid cells , many of which were also Gr-1(+) , and Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+) granulocytes . Only small numbers of P01730 T cells , CD8 T cells , NK cells , and gammadelta T cells , the most likely P01579 -producing cells , were seen at any time point . Sensitive intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry revealed no tumor-infiltrating hematopoietic cells with detectable levels of intracellular P01579 , although P01579 mRNA transcripts were detected in tumor tissue . However , a progressive increase in the expression of three P01579 -inducible surface membrane proteins ( Q9NZQ7 , I-A(d) , and P05362 ) on growing 4T1 tumor cells indicated the presence of biologically active P01579 in the tumor microenvironment . Moreover , 4T1 tumor cells from in vitro culture expressed these surface molecules 48 h after intratumoral injection into mature tumors . These data suggest that very low amounts of endogenous P01579 elaborated by infiltrating hematopoietic cells within the microenvironment of a solid tumor can achieve biologically active concentrations and affect tumor phenotype , growth , and metastasis . Activation of the P18621 pathway contributes to immune escape in P00533 -driven lung tumors . The success in lung cancer therapy with programmed death ( PD ) -1 blockade suggests that immune escape mechanisms contribute to lung tumor pathogenesis . We identified a correlation between P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) pathway activation and a signature of immunosuppression manifested by upregulation of P18621 , Q9NZQ7 , CTL antigen-4 ( P16410 ) , and multiple tumor-promoting inflammatory cytokines . We observed decreased CTLs and increased markers of T-cell exhaustion in mouse models of P00533 -driven lung cancer . P18621 antibody blockade improved the survival of mice with P00533 -driven adenocarcinomas by enhancing effector T-cell function and lowering the levels of tumor-promoting cytokines . Expression of mutant P00533 in bronchial epithelial cells induced Q9NZQ7 , and Q9NZQ7 expression was reduced by P00533 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with activated P00533 . These data suggest that oncogenic P00533 signaling remodels the tumor microenvironment to trigger immune escape and mechanistically link treatment response to P18621 inhibition . SIGNIFICANCE : We show that autochthonous P00533 -driven lung tumors inhibit antitumor immunity by activating the P18621 / Q9NZQ7 pathway to suppress T-cell function and increase levels of proinflammatory cytokines . These findings indicate that P00533 functions as an oncogene through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms and raise the possibility that other oncogenes may drive immune escape . Serum macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) levels after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . P14174 ( MIF ) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD ) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) , as MIF plays an important role to regulate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , one of the inflammatory cytokines which induces and exacerbates aGVHD . We examined the association between serum MIF levels and aGVHD vs. chronic GVHD ( cGVHD ) in allo- P09683 patients in this study . We found a significant increase in the peak serum MIF ( 14.46 ng +/- 1.47 ng/ml ) at onset in patients that developed aGVHD ( n = 23 , P = 0.009 ) . We also found that mean serum MIF levels in patients who developed extensive type cGVHD within 6 months ( 12.58 +/- 2.18 ng/ml , n = 13 ) were significantly higher than MIF levels before allo-HSCT ( 7.86 +/- 1.17 ng/ml , n = 19 , P = 0.04 ) . Therefore , we speculated that serum MIF levels increase during the active phase of both aGVHD and cGVHD . Advances in immunotherapy of chronic myeloid leukemia CML . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce sustained disease remissions in chronic myeloid leukemia by exploiting the addiction of this type of leukemia to the activity of the fusion oncogene P11274 - P00519 . However , these agents fail to eradicate CML stem cells which are ultimately responsible for disease relapses upon treatment discontinuation . Evidence that the immune system can effectively reject CML stem cells potentially leading to patient cure is provided by the experience with patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplantations . Compelling evidence indicates that more modern , antigen-specific immunotherapeutic approaches are also feasible and hold strong potential to be clinically effective . Amongst these , particularly promising is the use of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with antigens or direct application of in vitro transcribed RNA encoding for leukemia-associated antigens , since this approach allows to circumvent HLA-restriction of the leukemia-associated T cell epitopes that have been eventually identified . Combining these strategies with monoclonal antibodies , such as anti- P16410 or anti- P18621 , may help to obtain even stronger immune responses and better clinical results . This narrative review addresses this topic by focusing in particular on the cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies for CML and on the issue of the leukemia-associated antigens to be selected for targeting . Pharmacological properties of thalidomide and its analogues . Thalidomide and its immunomodulatory imide drugs ( IMiDs ) analogues DB00480 ( DB00480 , DB00480 ) and CC-4047 ( Actimid , DB08910 ) have been used as anti-inflammatory and anticancerous drugs in the recent years . Thalidomide and IMiDs inhibit the cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , interleukins ( IL ) 1-beta , 6 , 12 , and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) . They also costimulate primary human T , NKT and NK lymphocytes inducing their proliferation , cytokine production , and cytotoxic activity . On the other hand , the compounds are anti-angiogenic , anti-proliferative , and pro-apoptotic . Thalidomide analogues have been used as inhibitors of alpha glucosidase and could be potential drugs for diabetes treatment . In this review , we explore the current trend of the different structures , the new patents , and the possible new applications in different pathologies . DB08870 : its role in the treatment of anaplastic large cell and Hodgkin 's lymphoma . DB08870 is being developed in a joint collaboration between Seattle Genetics and Millennium : The Takeda Oncology Company . In August 2011 , it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . DB08870 is an antibody-drug conjugate that specifically targets the P01375 receptor superfamily member 8 ( P28908 ) antigen on the surface of cancer cells to induce cell death . DB08870 has shown efficacy in inducing apoptosis in HL and ALCL cell lines that express P28908 and reducing tumor size in preclinical models . DB08870 is under clinical evaluation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL and ALCL in both adults and children . It is being investigated for use as a combination agent with pre-existing frontline chemotherapies and as a stand-alone salvage therapy for use prior to autologous stem cell transplant . Treatment with brentuximab vedotin is generally well tolerated although it is associated with grade 1-2 adverse reactions such as neutropenia and there have been reports of grade 3-4 serious adverse events . In particular its use with chemotherapy regimens that include bleomycin is contraindicated because of adverse pulmonary effects . Mobilization of P29590 - P10276 negative blood stem cells and salvage with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in children with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia . BACKGROUND : Relapsed acute promyleocytic leukemia ( APL ) is treated with re-induction chemotherapy , commonly arsenic trioxide , and stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) . The effect of arsenic trioxide on autologous peripheral blood stem cell collection is unknown . PROCEDURE : Five pediatric patients with relapsed APL had P29590 - P10276 negative peripheral blood stem cells mobilized ( four after arsenic trioxide ) and underwent autologous P09683 after cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg x 2 ) and total body irradiation ( TBI-fractionated 1,200 cGy ) conditioning . RESULTS : All five patients remain in molecular remission a median of 20 months post-transplant . CONCLUSION : Autologous P09683 performed during molecular remission is a treatment option for pediatric patients with relapsed APL and may provide durable leukemia-free survival without the complications of allogeneic transplantation . Extrinsic apoptosis is impeded by direct binding of the APL fusion protein P06748 -RAR to Q15628 . A subset of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) cases has been characterized by the t(5;17)(q35;q21) translocation variant , which fuses nucleophosmin ( P06748 ) to retinoic acid receptor α ( P10276 ) . The resultant P06748 -RAR fusion protein blocks myeloid differentiation and leads to a leukemic phenotype similar to that caused by the t(15;17)(q22;q21) P29590 -RAR fusion . The contribution of the N-terminal 117 amino acids of P06748 contained within P06748 -RAR has not been well studied . As a molecular chaperone , P06748 interacts with a variety of proteins implicated in leukemogenesis . Therefore , a proteomic analysis was conducted to identify novel P06748 -RAR-associated proteins . P01375 receptor type I-associated DEATH domain protein ( Q15628 ) was identified as a relevant binding partner for P06748 -RAR . This interaction was validated by coprecipitation and colocalization analysis . Biologic assessment found that P06748 -RAR expression impaired P01375 -induced signaling through Q15628 , blunting P01375 -mediated activation of caspase-3 ( P42574 ) and caspase-8 ( Q14790 ) , to ultimately block apoptosis . IMPLICATIONS : This study identifies a novel mechanism through which P06748 -RAR affects leukemogenesis . DB08870 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma . INTRODUCTION : DB08870 , a novel anti- P28908 antibody-drug conjugate , delivers a cytotoxic agent into P28908 (+) cells . P28908 expression is characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) and Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . AREAS COVERED : We reviewed data on brentuximab vedotin , focusing on ALCL and discuss pharmacology , clinical trials leading to approval and future research directions . Systemic ALCL , 3 % of adult Q9NZ71 , is characterized by large anaplastic P28908 (+) cells . The fusion protein P06748 - Q9UM73 , when present in systemic ALCL , confers better prognosis , although even Q9UM73 - patients with IPI score ≥ 3 are high-risk . For patients with systemic ALCL , 25 - 45 % relapse after frontline therapy , and > 50 % of patients will relapse following high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell support . There has been no standard therapy for relapsed/refractory systemic ALCL . DB08870 , combines a monoclonal antibody targeted to P28908 with a microtubule disrupting agent and was recently approved for treatment of patients with systemic ALCL that is refractory or relapsed after at least one multiagent chemotherapy regimen . EXPERT OPINION : DB08870 provides targeted therapy to P28908 (+) lymphomas , including ALCL and HL , with high response rates and manageable toxicity , predominantly myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy .
Disease-dependent reciprocal phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues of c- DB00134 / P08581 contributes disease retardation of a transgenic mouse model of P35858 . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) is a fatal disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motoneurons . We have demonstrated that hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) attenuates loss of both spinal and brainstem motoneurons of P35858 model mice expressing mutated human P00441 (G93A) ( G93A ) . This study was designed to assess disease-dependent regulatory mechanisms of c- DB00134 / P08581 ( c- DB00134 ) activation in the facial motoneurons of G93A mice . Using double transgenic mice expressing P14210 and mutated P00441 (G93A) ( G93A/ P14210 ) , we showed that phosphorylation of c- DB00134 tyrosine residues at positions 1230 , 1234 and 1235 ( phospho- DB00135 ) , and thereby its activation , was slightly evident in G93A and highly obvious in G93A/ P14210 mice ( but absent in WT and P14210 -Tg mice ) . Phosphorylation of the c- DB00134 serine residue at position 985 ( phospho- DB00133 ) , a residue involved in the negative regulation of its activation , was evident in WT and P14210 -Tg mice . Protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) , which is capable of dephosphorylating c- DB00134 phospho-serine , is upregulated in the facial motoneurons of G93A and G93A/ P14210 mice compared with WT and P14210 -Tg mice . Thus , c- DB00134 activation is reciprocally regulated by phosphorylation between c- DB00134 serine and tyrosine residues through PP2A induction in the presence or absence of mutant P00441 expression , and P14210 functions more efficiently in P35858 and P35858 -related diseases . High doses of intravenous immunoglobulin do not affect the recognition phase of the classical complement pathway . We have recently found that intravenous immunoglobulin ( DB00028 ) prevents deposition of P01024 and C4 fragments onto antibody sensitized erythrocytes . To find out if such an effect results from the blockade of the recognition phase of the classical complement cascade , we investigated the ability of human serum containing high concentrations of DB00028 to deposit the recognition subunit of the first complement component ( C1q ) onto targets . Normal human serum supplemented in vitro with DB00028 did not demonstrate reduced C1q binding to targets as determined by radiolabeled antihuman C1q antibody uptake . Similarly , methylamine-treated normal human serum to which DB00028 was added was equally effective in terms of C1q binding as the same serum without DB00028 . At increasing doses of sensitizing antibody , C1q uptake decreased proportionally ; however , at all antibody dilution points C1q uptake was not significantly different in the serum with DB00028 in comparison with normal serum . Serum from a patient treated with DB00028 did not differ in its capacity to deposit C1q from the same patient 's serum before therapy . Our data suggest that DB00028 does not interfere with the recognition step of classical complement pathway . This is a US government work . There are no restrictions on its use . Drugs targeting nitric oxide synthase for migraine treatment . INTRODUCTION : Ample evidence that nitric oxide ( NO ) is a causative molecule in migraine has encouraged research to develop drugs that target the NO-cGMP cascade for migraine treatment . NO synthase ( NOS ) inhibition is an innovative therapeutic principle . AREAS COVERED : This paper reviews the rationale underlying NOS inhibition in migraine treatment . It also provides a review on the efficacy and safety data for NOS inhibitors ( nonselective NOS inhibitor L-N(G)-methyl-arginine hydrochloride [ L-NMMA ] , selective inducible NOS [ P35228 ] inhibitors GW273629 and GW274150 , combined neuronal NOS [ P29475 ] inhibitor and P28222 /1D receptor agonist DB06096 ) in acute or preventive migraine treatment . EXPERT OPINION : The data highlighted herein , from four placebo-controlled trials and 1 open-labeled clinical trial using 4 different NOS inhibitors on a total of 705 patients , provide convincing efficacy data only for the nonselective NOS inhibitor L-NMMA . Unfortunately , this NOS inhibitor raises cardiovascular safety concerns and has an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile . As experimental studies predicted , P35228 inhibitors are ineffective in migraine . Still , upcoming selective P29475 inhibitors are a hope for migraine treatment , with the P29475 isoform being most clearly involved in trigeminovascular transmission and central sensitization . Future studies should help to clarify whether NOS inhibition is equally fruitful in acute and preventive treatment . It should also clarify if P29475 inhibition holds promise as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of chronic migraine and other forms of headache . p38 Q96HU1 kinase regulates stem cell apoptosis in human hematopoietic failure . Myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) are clonal stem cell disorders that lead to ineffective hematopoiesis and are common causes of low blood counts in the elderly . The exact molecular mechanisms regulating increased stem apoptosis in these disorders are not well defined . p38 MAPK activation is important in regulating the growth inhibitory signals of P01375 , TGF-beta and Interferons on human hematopoiesis . Our findings show that p38 MAPK is overactivated in myelodysplasia bone marrows and regulates hematopoietic stem cell apoptosis . Inhibition of p38 MAPK by genetic or pharmacologic means decreases apoptosis and stimulates in vitro hematopoiesis from primary P43034 hematopoietic progenitors . These studies point to the potential efficacy of selective p38alpha inhibitor , DB05412 , in human bone marrow failure . P01375 polymorphisms as a potential modifier gene in the cystic fibrosis . Modifier genes , as the P01375 -α gene , can modulate the cystic fibrosis ( CF ) severity . Thus , -238G > A and -308G > A polymorphisms of P01375 -α gene were analyzed as modifiers of CF . In this context , the present study enrolled 49 CF patients ( diagnosis performed by sweat test and complete P13569 screening ) . The -238G > A polymorphism analysis was performed by Q9ULH0 -PCR , and -308G > A , by PCR-RFLP . In our data , the -238G > A polymorphism was not associated with clinical variability . The AA genotype for -308G > A polymorphism was a risk factor for early gastrointestinal symptoms ( OR=5.98 , 95 % CI=1.06-49.68 ) and protection for the first Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( OR=0.05 , 95 % CI=0.0003-0.007 ) . For the first P. aeruginosa , GA genotype was a risk factor ( OR=10.2 , 95 % CI=1.86-84.09 ) ; for the same genotype , the diagnosis was made in minor time than the AA genotype ( p=0.031 ) . Considering the -308G > A polymorphism alleles , the G allele was a risk factor for early pulmonary symptoms ( OR=3.81 , 95 % CI=1.13-12.97 ) and P. aeruginosa ( OR=66.77 , 95 % CI=15.18-482.7 ) ; however , the same allele showed better transcutaneous oxygen saturation ( OR=9.24 , 95 % CI=1.53-206.1 ) . The A allele was a protective factor for early pulmonary symptoms ( OR=12.26 , 95 % CI=0.08-0.89 ) and P. aeruginosa ( OR=12.15 , 95 % CI=0002-0007 ) , however , the same allele was a risk factor for worst transcutaneous oxygen saturation ( OR=7.01 , 95 % CI=1.14-157.4 ) . As conclusion , the -308G > A polymorphism of the P01375 -α gene was associated with the CF severity . Molecular physiology of glucagon-like peptide-1 insulin secretagogue action in pancreatic β cells . P01308 secretion from pancreatic β cells is stimulated by glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) , a blood glucose-lowering hormone that is released from enteroendocrine L cells of the distal intestine after the ingestion of a meal . P0C6A0 mimetics ( e.g. , DB01276 ) and P0C6A0 analogs ( e.g. , DB06655 ) activate the β cell P43220 ( P43220 ) , and these compounds stimulate insulin secretion while also lowering levels of blood glucose in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . An additional option for the treatment of T2DM involves the administration of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV ( DPP-IV ) inhibitors ( e.g. , Januvia , DB04876 ) . These compounds slow metabolic degradation of intestinally released P0C6A0 , thereby raising post-prandial levels of circulating P0C6A0 substantially . Investigational compounds that stimulate P0C6A0 secretion also exist , and in this regard a noteworthy advance is the demonstration that small molecule Q8TDV5 agonists ( e.g. , AR231453 ) stimulate L cell P0C6A0 secretion while also directly stimulating β cell insulin release . In this review , we summarize what is currently known concerning the signal transduction properties of the β cell P43220 as they relate to insulin secretion . Emphasized are the cyclic AMP , protein kinase A , and Epac2-mediated actions of P0C6A0 to regulate DB00171 -sensitive K⁺ channels , voltage-dependent K⁺ channels , O94759 cation channels , intracellular Ca⁺ release channels , and Ca⁺-dependent exocytosis . We also discuss new evidence that provides a conceptual framework with which to understand why P43220 agonists are less likely to induce hypoglycemia when they are administered for the treatment of T2DM . A DNA hypermethylation profile reveals new potential biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis . BACKGROUND : DNA hypermethylation has emerged as a novel molecular biomarker for the evaluation of prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis . Defining the specific gene hypermethylation profile for prostate cancer could involve groups of genes that specifically discriminate patients with indolent and aggressive tumors . METHODS : Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on 83 tumor and 10 normal prostate samples using the GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I ( Illumina , Inc. ) . All clinical stages of disease were considered . RESULTS : We found 41 genes hypermethylated in more than 20 % of the tumors analyzed ( P < 0.01 ) . Of these , we newly identified P28161 and P01210 as being genes that are hypermethylated in prostate cancer and that were simultaneously methylated in 40.9 % of the tumors analyzed . We also identified panels of genes that are more frequently methylated in tumor samples with clinico-pathological indicators of poor prognosis : a high Gleason score , elevated Ki-67 , and advanced disease . Of these , we found simultaneous hypermethylation of P13569 and P28222 to be common in patients with a high Gleason score and high Ki-67 levels ; this might indicate the population at higher risk of therapeutic failure . The DNA hypermethylation profile was associated with cancer-specific mortality ( log-rank test , P = 0.007 ) and biochemical recurrence-free survival ( log-rank test , P = 0.0008 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings strongly indicate that epigenetic silencing of P28161 and P01210 is a common event in prostate cancer that could be used as a molecular marker for prostate cancer diagnosis . In addition , simultaneous P28222 and P13569 hypermethylation could help discriminate aggressive from indolent prostate tumors . Drosophila Answers to Q13148 Proteinopathies . Initially implicated in the pathogenesis of P13569 and HIV-1 transcription , nuclear factor Q13148 was subsequently found to be involved in the origin and development of several neurodegenerative diseases . In 2006 , in fact , it was reported for the first time the cytoplasmic accumulation of Q13148 in ubiquitin-positive inclusions of P35858 and FTLD patients , suggesting the presence of a shared underlying mechanism for these diseases . Today , different animal models of Q13148 proteinopathies are available in rodents , nematodes , fishes , and flies . Although these models recapitulate several of the pathological features found in patients , the mechanisms underpinning the progressive neuronal loss observed in Q13148 proteinopathies remain to be characterized . Compared to other models , Drosophila are appealing because they combine the presence of a sophisticated brain with the possibility to investigate quickly and massively phenotypic genetic modifiers as well as possible therapeutic strategies . At present , the development of Q13148 -related Drosophila models has further strengthened the hypothesis that both Q13148 " loss-of-function " and " gain-of-function " mechanisms can contribute to disease . The aim of this paper is to describe and compare the results obtained in a series of transgenic and knockout flies , along with the information they have generated , towards a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying Q13148 proteinopathies . Cystic fibrosis modifier genes related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is one of the most common life-shortening genetic disorders , and the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) is the major causal gene . However , a substantial clinical variability among patients with identical P13569 genotypes suggests the presence of modifier genes . We tested the effect of four genes involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection . Analysis of a primary cohort detected eight candidate polymorphisms that were genotyped in the secondary cohort of 1579 patients ; lung function and age at first infection with P. aeruginosa were considered as the phenotypes . Both additive and codominant models were considered , adjusting for confounding variables but not for multiple comparisons . In the secondary cohort , heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) rs2071749 had the most significant effect on lung function in the pediatric group ( P=0.01 ; P(corrected)=0.03 ) , and complement factor 3 ( P01024 ) rs11569393 and P09601 rs2071746 in the adult groups ( P=0.03 for both variants ; P(corrected)=0.16 , 0.09 ) . No polymorphism of complement factor B ( P00751 ) or toll-like receptor 4 ( O00206 ) had a significant modifying effect on lung function in either group . We have identified two genes that showed nominal association with disease severity among CF patients . However , because of the multiple comparisons made , further studies are required to confirm the interaction between these modifying genes and P13569 . Interplay between inhibitory ferric and stimulatory curcumin regulates phosphorylation-dependent human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and ΔF508 activity . Curcumin potentiates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) activation in an DB00171 -independent but phosphorylation-dependent manner . The underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear . Here , P29320 -293T cells cultured in an Fe(3+)-containing medium were transiently transfected with P13569 constructs , and the role of the inhibitory Fe(3+) bridge between intracellular loop 3 and the regulatory domain of P13569 in this pathway was investigated . The results showed that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( DB00974 ) stimulated phosphorylation-dependent P13569 activation and the stimulation was suppressed by the deletion of the regulatory domain or the insertion of a C832A mutation that removes the Fe(3+)-binding interface . Furthermore , curcumin potentiation of P13569 was significantly weakened not only by Fe(3+)-insensitive mutations at the interface between the regulatory domain and intracellular loop 3 but also by N-ethylmaleimide or DB00974 pretreatment that removes Fe(3+) . More importantly , potentiation of P13569 was completely suppressed by sufficient Fe(3+) . Finally , the insertion of Fe(3+)-insensitive H950R/S768R increased the curcumin-independent activity of ΔF508 but weakened its curcumin potentiation . Thus , Fe(3+) homeostasis in epithelia may play a critical role in regulating P13569 activity , and targeting Fe(3+)-chelating potentiators may direct new therapies for cystic fibrosis . P01308 is involved in transcriptional regulation of NKCC and the P13569 Cl(-) channel through PI3K activation and P29323 inactivation in renal epithelial cells . It is is well known that insulin stimulates glucose transport and epithelial Na(+) channel ( ENaC ) -mediated Na(+) reabsorption ; however , the action of insulin on Cl(-) secretion is not fully understood . In this study , we investigated the action of insulin on Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter ( NKCC ) -mediated Cl(-) secretion in epithelial A6 cells . Interestingly , insulin treatment remarkably enhanced the forskolin-stimulated Cl(-) secretion associated with an increase in apical Cl(-) conductance by upregulating mRNA expression of both P13569 and NKCC , although insulin treatment alone had no effect on the basal Cl(-) secretion or apical Cl(-) conductance without forskolin application . We next elucidated a role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) in the insulin-induced enhancement of the Cl(-) secretion , since insulin actually activated PI3K , resulting in activation of Akt , a downstream molecule of PI3K . LY294002 ( a PI3K inhibitor ) reduced the Cl(-) secretion by suppressing mRNA expression of NKCC , whereas insulin still had a stimulatory action on mRNA expression of P13569 even in the presence of LY294002 . On the other hand , we found that a MEK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) further enhanced the insulin-stimulated P13569 mRNA expression and the Cl(-) secretion in forskolin-stimulated A6 cells and that insulin induced slight , transient activation of P29323 followed by significant inactivation of P29323 . These observations suggest that : ( 1 ) insulin respectively upregulates mRNA expression of NKCC and P13569 through activation of PI3K and inactivation of P29323 ; ( 2 ) insulin signals on mRNA expression of NKCC and P13569 are not enough to stimulate transepithelial Cl(-) secretion , but enhance the stimulatory action of DB02527 on transepithelial Cl(-) secretion . First intracellular loop of the human cholecystokinin-A receptor is essential for cyclic AMP signaling in transfected P29320 -293 cells . Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) -A and CCK-B receptors are highly homologous members of the seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily . Genes of both receptors contain five exons and share a similar exon-intron organization . To determine the structural basis of P32238 ( P32238 ) functionally coupled to Gs , a series of chimeric mutants were constructed by replacing exons of human P32239 ( P32239 ) , from the second to the fifth ( last ) exon , with human P32238 counterparts . Binding and signal transduction properties of wild-type and chimeric receptors were examined in stably transfected P29320 -293 cells . Chimeric receptors that maintained high affinity binding to CCK exhibited dose-dependent increases in intracellular calcium mobilization similar to both wild-type receptors . However , only the wild-type P32238 and chimeric mutants containing the second exon of P32238 were able to mediate significantly greater increases in intracellular DB02527 content and adenylyl cyclase activity compared with wild-type P32239 . A P32239 mutant was further constructed by replacing five amino acids , DB00145 - DB00149 - DB00133 - DB00125 -( DB00125 )- DB00149 , in the first intracellular loop with the corresponding five P32238 specific amino acids , DB00167 - DB00125 - DB00174 -Lys-( DB00125 )- DB00134 . The resultant receptor maintained high affinity binding to both CCK and gastrin and dose-dependent calcium responses similar to wild-type P32239 . However , this first intracellular loop mutant also gained positive DB02527 responses to both sulfated CCK-8 and gastrin-17 with EC50 values of 8.5 +/- 1 nM and 23 +/- 7 nM , respectively . These data suggest that the first intracellular loop of P32238 is essential for coupling to Gs and activation of adenylyl cyclase signal transduction cascade . Sensitivity of a renal K+ channel ( ROMK2 ) to the inhibitory sulfonylurea compound glibenclamide is enhanced by coexpression with the DB00171 -binding cassette transporter cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator . We demonstrate here that coexpression of ROMK2 , an inwardly rectifying DB00171 -sensitive renal K+ channel ( Q14654 ) with cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( P13569 ) significantly enhances the sensitivity of ROMK2 to the sulfonylurea compound glibenclamide . When expressed alone , ROMK2 is relatively insensitive to glibenclamide . The interaction between ROMK2 , P13569 , and glibenclamide is modulated by altering the phosphorylation state of either ROMK2 , P13569 , or an associated protein , as exogenous MgATP and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A significantly attenuate the inhibitory effect of glibenclamide on ROMK2 . Thus P13569 , which has been demonstrated to interact with both Na+ and Cl- channels in airway epithelium , modulates the function of renal ROMK2 K+ channels . P09917 pathway promotes cell proliferation in human glioma cell lines . OBJECTIVE : P09917 ( P09917 ) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of leukotrienes ( LTs ) , that might promote carcinogenesis . We investigated P09917 expression and examined whether the P09917 pathway is associated with the proliferation of human brain tumors . METHODS : We immunohistochemically evaluated the profile of P09917 expression in various types of brain tumors obtained from 42 patients , and examined the proliferative effects of the P09917 pathway in human glioma cell lines using a proliferation assay . RESULTS : Immunohistochemistry of glioblastomas , astrocytomas , meningiomas , medulloblastomas , craniopharyngiomas , ependymomas , neurinomas , oligodendrogliomas , malignant lymphomas , dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial and metastatic brain tumors revealed P09917 expression in the cytoplasm and nuclei or nuclear envelopes of tumor cells . The P09917 inhibitor A861 and the P09960 hydrolase inhibitor DB03424 dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of A172 cells , a glioma cell line . CONCLUSIONS : We confirmed the expression of P09917 in various human brain tumors and demonstrated the partial suppression of tumor growth by inhibitors of the P09917 - P09960 hydrolase pathway in human glioma cell lines . The P09917 - P09960 pathway might play roles in the proliferation of human glioma cells . Genomic structure of murine methylmalonyl- DB01992 mutase : evidence for genetic and epigenetic mechanisms determining enzyme activity . Methylmalonyl- DB01992 mutase ( P22033 ) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix enzyme . We have reported characterization of murine P22033 and cloning of a murine P22033 cDNA and now describe the murine Mut locus , its promoter and evidence for tissue-specific variation in P22033 mRNA , enzyme and holo-enzyme levels . The Mut locus spans 30 kb and contains 13 exons constituting a unique transcription unit . A B1 repeat element was found in the 3' untranslated region ( exon 13 ) . The transcription initiation site was identified and upstream sequences were shown to direct expression of a reporter gene in cultured cells . The promoter contains sequence motifs characteristic of : ( 1 ) TATA-less housekeeping promoters ; ( 2 ) enhancer elements purportedly involved in co-ordinating expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins ; and ( 3 ) regulatory elements including CCAAT boxes , cyclic AMP-response elements and potential P05549 -binding sites . Northern blots demonstrate a greater than 10-fold variation in steady-state mRNA levels , which correlate with tissue levels of enzyme activity . However , the ratio of holoenzyme to total enzyme varies among different tissues , and there is no correlation between steady-state mRNA levels and holoenzyme activity . These results suggest that , although there may be regulation of P22033 activity at the level of mRNA , the significance of genetic regulation is unclear owning to the presence of epigenetic regulation of holoenzyme formation . DB00640 regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator through prostenoids in airway epithelia . Cystic fibrosis is caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) protein , leading to altered ion transport , chronic infection , and excessive inflammation . Here we investigated regulation of P13569 in airway cell monolayers by adenosine , adenosine receptors , and arachidonic acid . Our studies demonstrate that the A2B adenosine receptor is expressed at high levels relative to the other adenosine receptor subtypes , with a characteristic low-affinity profile for adenosine-stimulated P13569 Cl- currents in both Calu-3 cells and CFBE41o- airway cell monolayers stably transduced with wild-type P13569 . The levels of adenosine found in sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis with moderate to severe lung disease stimulated apical prostaglandin release in Calu-3 and CFBE41o- cells , implicating adenosine regulation of phospholipase A2 ( P04054 ) activity . A2B adenosine receptor and arachidonic acid stimulation produced P13569 -dependent currents in airway monolayers and increased DB02527 levels that were sensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibition . Arachidonic acid demonstrated dual regulation of P13569 , stimulating P13569 and Cl- currents in intact airway monolayers , and potently inhibiting PKA-activated Cl- currents in excised membrane patches . Cl- currents produced by arachidonic acid were sensitive to inhibition of PKA , cyclooxygenase , and P09917 . Together , the results provide a converging mechanism to link regulation of P13569 and airway cell inflammation through adenosine and adenosine receptors . Potentiator ivacaftor abrogates pharmacological correction of ΔF508 P13569 in cystic fibrosis . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) . Newly developed " correctors " such as DB09280 ( VX-809 ) that improve P13569 maturation and trafficking and " potentiators " such as ivacaftor ( VX-770 ) that enhance channel activity may provide important advances in CF therapy . Although VX-770 has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in the small subset of patients with a mutation ( G551D ) that affects only channel activity , a single compound is not sufficient to treat patients with the more common P13569 mutation , ΔF508 . Thus , patients with ΔF508 will likely require treatment with both correctors and potentiators to achieve clinical benefit . However , whereas the effectiveness of acute treatment with this drug combination has been demonstrated in vitro , the impact of chronic therapy has not been established . In studies of human primary airway epithelial cells , we found that both acute and chronic treatment with VX-770 improved P13569 function in cells with the G551D mutation , consistent with clinical studies . In contrast , chronic VX-770 administration caused a dose-dependent reversal of VX-809-mediated P13569 correction in ΔF508 homozygous cultures . This result reflected the destabilization of corrected ΔF508 P13569 by VX-770 , markedly increasing its turnover rate . Chronic VX-770 treatment also reduced mature wild-type P13569 levels and function . These findings demonstrate that chronic treatment with P13569 potentiators and correctors may have unexpected effects that can not be predicted from short-term studies . Combining these drugs to maximize rescue of ΔF508 P13569 may require changes in dosing and/or development of new potentiator compounds that do not interfere with P13569 stability . Improved diabetic control during oral sulfonylurea treatment in two children with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus . Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ( P01160 ) , defined as diabetes diagnosed in the first 6 months of age and requiring life-long insulin therapy , is a rare disorder of unknown etiology . Activating mutations of the Q14654 gene , which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the DB00171 -dependent potassium channel in beta-cells , have been found to cause 30-58 % of cases of P01160 . Sulfonylurea treatment in theses patients reduces or eliminates the need for exogenous insulin . We report two Taiwanese boys who were diagnosed with P01160 at 1 and 4.5 months of age . They had been treated with exogenous insulin for 6 and 15 years , respectively . In September 2006 , they were both found to have a Q14654 mutation ( valine-to-methionine at codon 59 ; V59M ) . DB01016 successfully increased the basal C-peptide level , lowered HbA(1c) , and reduced blood sugar excursions . In one patient , the insulin dose was reduced to 0.2 U/kg/day , and the other was able to discontinue insulin altogether . These two cases from Taiwan add to the experience with similar mutations reported in Caucasians . DB08865 for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer . DB08865 is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of Q9UM73 ( anaplastic lymphoma kinase ; Q9UM73 ) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( P08581 , proto-oncogene c- DB00134 ) . A range of tumors , including subsets of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , anaplastic large cell lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harbor an Q9UM73 rearrangement that leads to oncogenic activation of Q9UM73 . DB08865 has demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity against such malignancies through inhibition of Q9UM73 , and patients harboring Q9UM73 - rearranged NSCLC have demonstrated high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival in phase I and II studies . In August 2011 , crizotinib was approved for the treatment of advanced Q9UM73 -positive NSCLC . Possible role of cholecystokinin-A receptors in regulation of thyrotropin ( DB00024 ) secretion in male rats . We studied the importance of cholecystokinin ( CCK ) system in the regulation of thyrotropin ( DB00024 ) and prolactin ( PRL ) secretion in male rats . To this end , we tested the effects of both unselective CCK agonists CCK-8 and caerulein , and CCK-B selective agonists Q13308 and pentagastrin as well as the selective CCK antagonists ( devazepide and L-365,260 ) at wide dose-ranges on the cold-stimulated and TRH-induced DB00024 and PRL secretion . DB00403 , given s.c . 15 min before sacrifice , decreased DB00024 levels at 5 micrograms/kg . In time course-studies , the maximum inhibition was seen at 15 min but the effect lasted at least 30 , but less than 60 min . Also CCK-8 decreased DB00024 levels at the doses of 20 and 50 micrograms/kg at 15 min . Devazepide and L-365,260 did not affect DB00024 or PRL levels at any dose . The effect of caerulein ( 5 micrograms/kg ) was antagonized by devazepide , a CCK-A antagonist , at 100 micrograms/kg , but not by a CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 tested at a wide dose range . PRL levels were not affected by any treatment . DB00403 ( 5 micrograms/kg ) , given at the same time as TRH ( 500 ng/kg ) , inhibited the TRH-induced DB00024 levels at 15 min , but not at 30 or 60 min . CCK-8 ( 50 micrograms/kg ) , Q13308 ( 100 micrograms/kg ) and pentagastrin ( 500 micrograms/kg ) did not affect the TRH-induced DB00024 secretion . The results probably indicate that P32238 stimulation inhibits DB00024 secretion at the level of the anterior pituitary gland . PRL levels in male rats are not affected by CCK system . [ Diagnosis and treatment of isolated methylmalonic acidemia ] . OBJECTIVE : To explore the clinical feature , therapeutic effect and prognosis of isolated methylmalonic acidemia . METHODS : The clinical characteristics , laboratory findings , treatment and outcome of 40 patients were retrospectively analyzed . The main treatment was a low-protein diet supplemented with L-carnitine and special milk free of leucine , valine , threonine and methionine . DB00115 was also given to cobalamin responders . The patients were followed up every 1-3 months . RESULTS : Mutations in the P22033 gene were identified in 30 of 33 patients who had accepted DNA testing . Thirty cases were treated and followed up regularly for from 1 month to 8 years . Eight cases had died , 8 had developed normal intelligence , among whom 4 from newborn screening were asymptomatic . Psychomotor developmental delay and mental retardation were present in 14 cases . The propionylcarnitine level , ratio of propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine in blood , methylmalonic acid and methylcitric acid levels in urine have decreased significantly , with the median values reduced respectively from 24.15 ( 7.92-81.02 ) μmol/L , 1.08 ( 0.38-6.01 ) , 705.34 ( 113.79-3078.60 ) and 7.71 ( 0.52-128.21 ) to 10.50 ( 3.00-30.92 ) μmol/L , 0.63 ( 0.25-2.89 ) , 166.23 ( 22.40-3322.21 ) and 3.96 ( 0.94-119.13 ) ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : The prognosis of isolated methylmalonic acidemia may be predicted with the enzymatic subgroup , age at onset and cobalamin responsiveness . Outcome is unfavorable in neonatal patients and those who were non-responsive to cobalamin . Multiple endocytic signals in the C-terminal tail of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator . The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) is a DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) -activated chloride channel that is localized to the plasma membrane and endosomal compartment . Endosomal targeting of P13569 is attributed to the DB00135 (1424)-based internalization signal , identified in the C-terminal tail of the channel . Mutation of the DB00135 (1424) residue could partly inhibit the endocytosis of P13569 and its association with the adapter protein P05549 . To reveal additional endosomal targeting signals , site-directed mutagenesis of both a chimaera , composed of a truncated form of interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain ( TacT ) and the C-terminal tail of P13569 ( Ct ) , and the full-length P13569 was performed . Morphological and functional assays revealed the presence of multiple internalization motifs at the C-terminus , consisting of a phenylalanine-based motif ( DB00120 (1413) ) and a bipartite endocytic signal , comprising a tyrosine ( DB00135 (1424) ) and a di- DB00149 -based ( DB00149 (1430)- DB00149 ) motif . Whereas the replacement of any one of the three internalization motifs with alanine prevented the endocytosis of the TacT-Ct chimaera , mutagenesis of DB00120 (1413)- DB00149 impaired the biosynthetic processing of P13569 , indicating that DB00120 (1413) is indispensable for the native structure of P13569 . In contrast , replacement of DB00149 (1430)- DB00149 - and DB00135 (1424)-based signals with alanine increased the cell-surface density of both the chimaeras and P13569 in an additive manner . These results suggest that the internalization of P13569 is regulated by multiple endocytic sorting signals .
Suppression of androgen receptor-mediated gene expression by a sequence-specific DNA-binding polyamide . P10275 ( AR ) is essential for the growth and progression of prostate cancer in both hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory disease . A DNA-binding polyamide that targets the consensus androgen response element binds the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) promoter androgen response element , inhibits androgen-induced expression of PSA and several other AR-regulated genes in cultured prostate cancer cells , and reduces AR occupancy at the PSA promoter and enhancer . Down-regulation of PSA by this polyamide was comparable to that produced by the synthetic antiandrogen bicalutamide ( DB01128 ) at the same concentration . Genome-wide expression analysis reveals that a similar number of transcripts are affected by treatment with the polyamide and with bicalutamide . Direct inhibition of the AR-DNA interface by sequence-specific DNA binding small molecules could offer an alternative approach to antagonizing AR activity . Predictive factors for response to docetaxel in human breast cancers . DB01248 has come into wide use recently for the treatment of breast cancer in neoadjuvant , adjuvant and metastatic settings . DB01248 binds to beta-tubulin and causes kinetic abnormalities in the dynamics of microtubules by increasing their polymerization and inhibiting their depolymerization , resulting in elevated levels of microtubule formation . During metaphase , defective spindle formation induced by docetaxel activates the mitotic checkpoint and leads to cell cycle arrest , culminating in apoptosis . However , docetaxel is not effective for all breast cancers . For example , in metastatic settings , the response rate to docetaxel reportedly ranges from 30 to 50 % . It is therefore very important to develop a diagnostic method with high accuracy for the prediction of sensitivity to docetaxel in order to avoid unnecessary treatment . Currently it is impossible to identify , before the initiation of therapy , the patients for whom docetaxel will be effective . Various biological parameters have been studied clinically for their ability to predict response to docetaxel , such as parameters related to : ( 1 ) efflux ( p-glycoprotein ) and metabolism ( P08684 ) ; ( 2 ) beta-tubulin ( somatic mutation of beta-tubulin and changes in beta-tubulin isotypes levels ) ; ( 3 ) cell cycle ( P04626 , P38398 and Aurora-A ) ; and ( 4 ) apoptosis ( p53 , P10415 and thioredoxin ) . More recently , gene expression profiling techniques have been used for the development of a prediction model for response to docetaxel . In the present paper , clinical studies that have been conducted recently to identify predictive factors for response to docetaxel are reviewed together with a presentation of our recent work in this field . Effect of kinase inhibitors on the therapeutic properties of monoclonal antibodies . Targeted therapies of malignancies currently consist of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors . The combination of these novel agents raises the issue of potential antagonisms . We evaluated the potential effect of 4 kinase inhibitors , including the Q06187 inhibitor ibrutinib , and 3 PI3K inhibitors idelalisib , DB00238 -BEZ235 and LY294002 , on the effects of the 3 monoclonal antibodies , rituximab and obinutuzumab ( directed against P11836 ) and trastuzumab ( directed against P04626 ) . We found that ibrutinib potently inhibits antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity exerted by all antibodies , with a 50 % inhibitory concentration of 0.2 microM for trastuzumab , 0.5 microM for rituximab and 2 microM for obinutuzumab , suggesting a lesser effect in combination with obinutuzumab than with rituximab . The 4 kinase inhibitors were found to inhibit phagocytosis by fresh human neutrophils , as well as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis induced by the 3 antibodies . Conversely co-administration of ibrutinib with rituximab , obinutuzumab or trastuzumab did not demonstrate any inhibitory effect of ibrutinib in vivo in murine xenograft models . In conclusion , some kinase inhibitors , in particular , ibrutinib , are likely to exert inhibitory effects on innate immune cells . However , these effects do not compromise the antitumor activity of monoclonal antibodies in vivo in the models that were evaluated . Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives as potential antidepressant agents . Part 1 . A series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives was synthesized and their biological activity was evaluated . The chemical structures of the newly prepared compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR , (13)C NMR and P19957 -HRMS spectra data . All tested compounds proved to be potent P08908 receptor and serotonin transporter protein ( P31645 ) ligands . Among them , compounds 15 , 18 , 19 and 30 showed significant affinity for P08908 and P31645 . Computer docking simulations carried out for compounds 15 , 31 and 32 to models of P08908 receptor and P31645 confirm the results of biological tests . Due to high affinity for the P08908 receptor and moderate affinity for P31645 , compounds 31 , 32 , 35 , and 37 were evaluated for their affinity for D2L , P50406 , P34969 and 5- Q13049 receptors . In vivo tests , in turn , resulted in determining the functional activity of compounds 15 , 18 , 19 and 30 to the P08908 receptor . The results of these tests indicate that all of the ligands possess properties characteristic of P08908 receptor agonists . Inhibition of histamine H1 receptor activity modulates proinflammatory cytokine production of dendritic cells through c-Rel activity . BACKGROUND : DB11320 exerts diverse effects on immune regulation through four types of histamine receptors ( HRs ) . Among them , type 1 receptor ( P35367 ) plays an important role in allergic inflammation . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) , which express at least three types of HRs , are professional antigen-presenting cells controlling the development of allergic inflammation . However , the molecular mechanisms involved in P35367 -mediated NF-ĸB signaling of DCs remain poorly defined . METHODS : Bone-marrow ( BM ) -derived DCs ( BM-DCs ) were treated with P35367 inverse agonists to interrupt basal P35367 -mediated signaling . The crosstalk of P35367 -mediated signaling and the NF-ĸB pathway was examined by NF-ĸB cellular activity using a luciferase reporter assay , NF-ĸB subunit analysis using Western blotting and P01375 -α promoter activity using chromatin immunoprecipitation . RESULTS : Blockage of P35367 signaling by inverse agonists significantly inhibited P01375 -α and P05231 production of BM-DCs . P35367 -specific agonists were able to enhance P01375 -α production , but this overexpression was significantly inhibited by NF-ĸB inhibitor . The P35367 inverse agonist ketotifen also suppressed cellular NF-ĸB activity , suggesting crosstalk between P35367 and NF-ĸB signaling in DCs . After comprehensive analysis of NF-ĸB subunits , c-Rel protein expression was significantly down-regulated in ketotifen-treated BM-DCs , which led to inhibition of the promoter activity of P01375 -α . Finally , adoptive transfer of the ketotifen-treated BM-DCs did not induce significant allergic airway inflammation compared to that of control cells in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that c-Rel controls P35367 -mediated proinflammatory cytokine production in DCs . This study provides a potential mechanism of P35367 -mediated signaling and NF-ĸB pathway crosstalk in allergic inflammation . The cooperation between hMena overexpression and P04626 signalling in breast cancer . hMena and the epithelial specific isoform hMena(11a) are actin cytoskeleton regulatory proteins belonging to the Ena/ P50552 family . P01133 treatment of breast cancer cell lines upregulates hMena/hMena(11a) expression and phosphorylates hMena(11a) , suggesting cross-talk between the ErbB receptor family and hMena/hMena(11a) in breast cancer . The aim of this study was to determine whether the hMena/hMena(11a) overexpression cooperates with HER-2 signalling , thereby affecting the P04626 mitogenic activity in breast cancer . In a cohort of breast cancer tissue samples a significant correlation among hMena , P04626 overexpression , the proliferation index ( high Ki67 ) , and phosphorylated MAPK and AKT was found and among the molecular subtypes the highest frequency of hMena overexpressing tumors was found in the P04626 subtype . From a clinical viewpoint , concomitant overexpression of P04626 and hMena identifies a subgroup of breast cancer patients showing the worst prognosis , indicating that hMena overexpression adds prognostic information to P04626 overexpressing tumors . To identify a functional link between P04626 and hMena , we show here that P04626 transfection in MCF7 cells increased hMena/hMena(11a) expression and hMena(11a) phosphorylation . On the other hand , hMena/hMena(11a) knock-down reduced P21860 , AKT and Q8TCB0 /42 MAPK phosphorylation and inhibited the P01133 and Q02297 -dependent P04626 phosphorylation and cell proliferation . Of functional significance , hMena/hMena(11a) knock-down reduced the mitogenic activity of P01133 and Q02297 . Collectively these data provide new insights into the relevance of hMena and hMena(11a) as downstream effectors of the ErbB receptor family which may represent a novel prognostic indicator in breast cancer progression , helping to stratify patients . Prasugrel : a new antiplatelet drug for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease . Prasugrel , trade name DB06209 , is an investigational new antiplatelet drug currently under review for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration . It is a thienopyridine analog with a structure similar to that of clopidogrel and ticlopidine . Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate by irreversibly inhibiting the binding of adenosine diphosphate to the purinergic Q9H244 receptor on the platelet surface . Prasugrel has been shown to be a potent antiplatelet agent with a faster , more consistent , and greater inhibition of platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel . It is debatable , however , how effectively these pharmacologic benefits will translate to clinical benefits . The results of the large TRITON-TIMI 38 trial , which compared prasugrel and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were scheduled to receive coronary stents , demonstrated a significant reduction in ischemic events , including stent thrombosis , with prasugrel , but with an increased risk of major bleeding . The exact role of prasugrel in the management of ischemic heart disease is still being defined , but the risk:benefit ratio will likely play a major role in directing the best place for therapy with this new agent . DB00563 induces apoptosis through p53/ P38936 -dependent pathway and increases P12830 expression through downregulation of HDAC/ Q15910 . DB00563 ( MTX ) is a dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitor widely used as an anticancer drug in different kinds of human cancers . Here we investigated the anti-tumor mechanism of MTX against non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) A549 cells . MTX not only inhibited in vitro cell growth via induction of apoptosis , but also inhibited tumor formation in animal xenograft model . RNase protection assay ( RPA ) and RT-PCR demonstrated its induction of p53 target genes including DR5 , P38936 , Puma and Noxa . Moreover , MTX promoted p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and acetylaion at Lys373/382 , which increase its stability and expression . The apoptosis and inhibition of cell viability induced by MTX were dependent on p53 and , partially , on P38936 . In addition , MTX also increased P12830 expression through inhibition of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) activity and downregulation of polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2 ( Q15910 ) . Therefore , the anticancer mechanism of MTX acts through initiation of p53-dependent apoptosis and restoration of P12830 expression by downregulation of HDAC/ Q15910 . Discovery and structure-activity relationship of ( 1R ) -8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-methyl-1H-3-benzazepine ( DB04871 ) , a selective serotonin P28335 receptor agonist for the treatment of obesity . The synthesis and SAR of a novel 3-benzazepine series of P28335 agonists is described . Compound 7d ( lorcaserin , APD356 ) was identified as one of the more potent and selective compounds in vitro ( pEC50 values in functional assays measuring [(3)H]phosphoinositol turnover : P28335 = 8.1 ; 5- Q13049 = 6.8 ; P41595 = 6.1 ) and was potent in an acute in vivo rat food intake model upon oral administration ( ED50 at 6 h = 18 mg/kg ) . DB04871 was further characterized in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in rat ( t1/2 = 3.7 h ; F = 86 % ) and a 28-day model of weight gain in growing Sprague-Dawley rat ( 8.5 % decrease in weight gain observed at 36 mg/kg b.i.d. ) . DB04871 was selected for further evaluation in clinical trials for the treatment of obesity . Rapid modulation of spine morphology by the 5- Q13049 serotonin receptor through kalirin-7 signaling . The 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptor is the most abundant serotonin receptor subtype in the cortex and is predominantly expressed in pyramidal neurons . The 5-HT(2A) receptor is a target of several hallucinogens , antipsychotics , anxiolytics , and antidepressants , and it has been associated with several psychiatric disorders , conditions that are also associated with aberrations in dendritic spine morphogenesis . However , the role of 5-HT(2A) receptors in regulating dendritic spine morphogenesis in cortical neurons is unknown . Here we show that the 5-HT(2A) receptor is present in a subset of spines , in addition to dendritic shafts . It colocalizes with P78352 and with multiple PDZ protein-1 ( O75970 ) in a subset of dendritic spines of rat cortical pyramidal neurons . O75970 is enriched in postsynaptic density ( A5PKW4 ) fractions , is targeted to spines in pyramidal neurons , and enhances the localization of 5-HT(2A) receptors to the cell periphery . 5-HT(2A) receptor activation by the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist DOI induced a transient increase in dendritic spine size , as well as phosphorylation of P38936 -activated kinase ( PAK ) in cultured cortical neurons . PAK is a downstream target of the neuronal Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( RacGEF ) kalirin-7 that is important for spine remodeling . O60229 -7 regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis in neurons but its role in neuromodulator signaling has not been investigated . We show that peptide interference that prevents the localization of kalirin-7 to the postsynaptic density disrupts DOI-induced PAK phosphorylation and spine morphogenesis . These results suggest a potential role for serotonin signaling in modulating spine morphology and kalirin-7 's function at cortical synapses . FTY720 induces apoptosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells via dual activation of O43521 and P55957 and overcomes various types of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . PP2A activator FTY720 has been shown to possess the anti-leukemic activity for chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , however , the cell killing mechanism underlying its anti-leukemic activity has remained to be verified . We investigated the precise mechanisms underlying the apoptosis induction by FTY720 , especially focusing on the roles of BH3-only proteins , and the therapeutic potency of FTY720 for CML . Enforced expression of either P10415 or the dominant-negative protein of Q13158 ( Q13158 .DN ) partly protected CML cells from apoptosis by FTY720 , indicating the involvement of both cell extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways . FTY720 activates pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins : O43521 , which is essential for apoptosis by P11274 - P00519 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , and P55957 , which accelerates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway . Gene knockdown of either O43521 or P55957 partly protected K562 cells from apoptosis by FTY720 , but the extent of cell protection was not as much as that by overexpression of either P10415 or Q13158 .DN . Moreover , knockdown of both O43521 and P55957 did not provide additional protection compared with knockdown of only O43521 or P55957 , indicating that O43521 and P55957 complement each other in apoptosis by FTY720 , especially when either is functionally impaired . FTY720 can overcome TKI resistance caused by P00519 kinase domain mutations , dysfunction of O43521 resulting from gene deletion polymorphism , and galectin-3 overexpression . In addition , DB05764 , a BH3-mimetic , significantly augmented cell death induction by FTY720 both in TKI-sensitive and -resistant leukemic cells . These results provide the rationale that FTY720 , with its unique effects on O43521 and P55957 , could lead to new therapeutic strategies for CML . Initial responses of osteoblasts derived from human alveolar bone to various compressive forces . Mechanical stress generated by orthodontic force is recognized as a major factor in the modulation of alveolar bone remodeling . During this process , osteoblasts play a crucial role , not only by participating in bone formation but also by promoting osteoclastogenesis . The aim of this study was to investigate how continuous compressive force ( CF ) affects human primary osteoblasts ( HOBs ) in terms of cell proliferation , apoptosis , and expression of interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) and chemokine CXC ligand 8 ( P10145 ) . Human primary osteoblasts , isolated from human mandibular bone pieces , were cultured with or without CF ( 1-4 g cm(-2) ) for up to 72 h . Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated using the MTT assay . RT-PCR was used to determine the levels of expression of KI67 ( a proliferation marker ) , Q07812 ( a pro-apoptotic marker ) , P10415 ( an apoptotic inhibitor ) , P05231 , and P10145 mRNAs , while a multiplexed bead immunoassay was used to measure the release of P05231 and P10145 . The results revealed that CF decreased cell viability and proliferation in a time- and force-dependent manner . After applying CF for 24 h , the mRNA expression of KI67 was markedly inhibited , whereas the mRNA expression of Q07812 and P10415 was unaltered . In addition , CF enhanced the levels of P05231 and P10145 mRNAs in a force-dependent manner , whereas the levels of the corresponding proteins were reduced in the compressed HOBs . Apoptotic markers in a prostate cancer cell line : effect of ellagic acid . Ellagic acid ( EA ) inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in cultured cells ; however , the precise molecular mechanism involved in EA-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is unknown . The aim of the present study was to delineate possible apoptotic pathway(s) involved in the EA-mediated chemotherapeutic effects in the LNCaP human prostatic cancer cell line . EA produced anti-proliferative effects through inhibition of rapamycin ( P42345 ) activation and a reduction in intracellular levels of β-catenin . Moreover , we demonstrated that EA induced apoptosis via downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins , silent information regulator 1 ( Q96EB6 ) , human antigen R ( Q15717 ) and heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) . EA modulated the expression of apoptosis-inducing factor ( O95831 ) resulting in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels and the activation of caspase-3 . Finally , we demonstrated that EA reduced both transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) levels . EA treatment resulted in the increased expression of the tumor suppressor protein P38936 and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells . In conclusion , the results suggest that EA treatment represents a new and highly effective strategy in reducing prostate cancer carcinogenesis . Combination of ibrutinib with ABT-199 : synergistic effects on proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in mantle cell lymphoma cells through perturbation of Q06187 , AKT and P10415 pathways . Molecular targeting of the oncoprotein P53350 in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia : RO3280 , a novel P53350 inhibitor , induces apoptosis in leukemia cells . P53350 ( P53350 ) is highly expressed in many cancers and therefore a biomarker of transformation and potential target for the development of cancer-specific small molecule drugs . RO3280 was recently identified as a novel P53350 inhibitor ; however its therapeutic effects in leukemia treatment are still unknown . We found that the P53350 protein was highly expressed in leukemia cell lines as well as 73.3 % ( 11/15 ) of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) samples . P53350 mRNA expression was significantly higher in AML samples compared with control samples ( 82.95 ± 110.28 vs. 6.36 ± 6.35 ; p < 0.001 ) . Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that shorter survival time correlated with high tumor P53350 expression ( p = 0.002 ) . The 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) of RO3280 for acute leukemia cells was between 74 and 797 nM . The IC50 of RO3280 in primary acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) and AML cells was between 35.49 and 110.76 nM and 52.80 and 147.50 nM , respectively . RO3280 induced apoptosis and cell cycle disorder in leukemia cells . RO3280 treatment regulated several apoptosis-associated genes . The regulation of P43146 , P38936 , Q06187 , and O14508 was verified by western blot . These results provide insights into the potential use of RO3280 for AML therapy ; however , the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined . P13688 impedes thyroid cancer growth but promotes invasiveness : a putative mechanism for early metastases . P13688 , also known as biliary glycoprotein ( BGP ) , CD66a , Q00839 and C- P62158 , is a member of the P06731 immunoglobulin superfamily . P13688 is a putative tumor suppressor based on diminished expression in some solid neoplasms such as colorectal carcinoma . However , P13688 is overexpressed in some tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer . To clarify the mechanism of action of this cell adhesion molecule , we studied thyroid carcinoma that has a spectrum of morphologies and variable behavior allowing separation of proliferation from invasion and metastasis . P13688 is expressed in thyroid carcinoma cell lines derived from tumors that exhibit aggressive behavior . Introduction of P13688 into endogenously deficient WRO cells resulted in reduced cell cycle progression associated with P38936 upregulation and diminished Rb phosphorylation . Forced P13688 expression enhanced cell-matrix adhesion and migration and promoted tumor invasiveness . Conversely , small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) -mediated downregulation of P13688 expression in Q9BYG7 cells accelerated cell cycle progression and significantly enhanced tumor size in xenografted mice . P13688 is not appreciably expressed in normal thyroid tissue or benign thyroid tumors . In a human thyroid tissue array , P13688 reactivity was associated with metastatic spread but not with increased tumor size . These findings identify P13688 as a unique mediator that restricts tumor growth whereas increasing metastatic potential . Our data highlight a complex repertoire of actions providing a putative mechanism underlying the spectrum of biologic behaviors associated with thyroid cancer . Inhibitors of Q06187 and Q08881 : state of the new drugs for cancer , autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases . Q06187 and Q08881 are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of crucial importance for B and T cell development , with loss-of-function mutations causing X-linked agammaglobulinemia and susceptibility to severe , frequently lethal , Epstein-Barr virus infection , respectively . Over the last few years , considerable efforts have been made in order to develop small-molecule inhibitors for these kinases to treat lymphocyte malignancies , autoimmunity or allergy/hypersensitivity . The rationale is that even if complete lack of Q06187 or Q08881 during development causes severe immunodeficiency , inactivation after birth may result in a less severe phenotype . Moreover , therapy can be transient or only partially block the activity of Q06187 or Q08881 . Furthermore , a drug-induced B cell deficiency is treatable by gamma globulin substitution therapy . The newly developed Q06187 inhibitor P05154 -32765 , recently renamed DB09053 , has already entered several clinical trials for various forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as for multiple myeloma . Experimental animal studies have demonstrated highly promising treatment effects also in autoimmunity . Q08881 inhibitors are still under the early developmental phase , but it can be expected that such drugs will also become very useful . In this study , we present Q06187 and Q08881 with their signalling pathways and review the development of the corresponding inhibitors . Simultaneous inhibition of MEK and P11802 leads to potent apoptosis in human melanoma cells . ABSTRACT Deregulation of DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 and P42771 -cycylin D: P11802 /6-RB pathways is important for melanoma development . Chemotherapeutic agents targeting both pathways were developed but results of clinical studies with monotherapies were disappointing . We examined the effect of co-targeting both pathways with MEK inhibitor PD98059 and P11802 inhibitor 219476 on human melanoma cells lines , and found that combinatorial treatment dramatically increased apoptosis compared to the single agent treatment . The apoptosis was associated with downregulation of P10415 , Q07817 , O15392 , and upregulation of O43521 . Our results indicate that simultaneously targeting P29323 and RB pathways is a promising strategy for melanoma treatment and should encourage further in-depth investigations . Genetic expression profiles and chromosomal alterations in sporadic breast cancer in Mexican women . Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of death among Mexican women > 35 years of age . At the molecular level , changes in many genetic pathways have been reported to be associated with this neoplasm . To analyze these changes , we determined gene expression profiles and chromosomal structural alterations in tumors from Mexican women . We obtained mRNA to identify expression profiles with microarray technology , and DNA to determine amplifications and deletions , in 10 fresh sporadic breast tumor biopsies without treatment , as well as in 10 nonaffected breast tissues . Expression profiles were compared with genetic changes observed by comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) . We compared the expression profiles against the structural alterations from the studied genes by means of microarrays ; at least 17 of these genes correlated with DNA copy number alterations . We found that the following genes were overexpressed : P11047 , Q07002 , P24863 , P24385 , P11487 , Q00537 , L1CAM , P21810 , and Q9ULL4 ( alias PLEXR ) . Underexpressed genes included P55211 , P09769 , O15350 , P98160 , and P07992 ; genes turned off included P42345 , P29317 ( previously P29317 ) , P29459 , Q15329 , O14763 , O00220 , Q15768 , and P10415 . The results will allow us , in the near future , to outline genes that could serve as diagnostic , prognostic , or target therapy markers for the Mexican population . P41134 enhances docetaxel cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells through inhibition of P38936 . To identify potential mechanisms underlying prostate cancer chemotherapy response and resistance , we compared the gene expression profiles in high-risk human prostate cancer specimens before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical prostatectomy . Among the molecular signatures associated with chemotherapy , transcripts encoding inhibitor of DNA binding 1 ( P41134 ) were significantly upregulated . The patient biochemical relapse status was monitored in a long-term follow-up . Patients with P41134 upregulation were found to be associated with longer relapse-free survival than patients without P41134 increase . This in vivo clinical association was mechanistically investigated . The chemotherapy-induced P41134 upregulation was recapitulated in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP . DB01248 dose-dependently induced P41134 transcription , which was mediated by P41134 promoter E-box chromatin modification and c-Myc binding . Stable P41134 overexpression in LNCaP increased cell proliferation , promoted G(1) cell cycle progression , and enhanced docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity . These changes were accompanied by a decrease in cellular mitochondria content , an increase in P10415 phosphorylation at serine 70 , caspase-3 activation , and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage . In contrast , P41134 siRNA in the LNCaP and C42B cell lines reduced cell proliferation and decreased docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting cell death . P41134 -mediated chemosensitivity enhancement was in part due to P41134 suppression of P38936 . Overexpression of P38936 in LNCaP- P41134 -overexpressing cells restored the P38936 level and reversed P41134 -enhanced chemosensitivity . These molecular data provide a mechanistic rationale for the observed in vivo clinical association between P41134 upregulation and relapse-free survival . Taken together , it shows that P41134 expression has a novel therapeutic role in prostate cancer chemotherapy and prognosis . 5- Q9H205 - and P28335 -antagonist properties of cyamemazine : significance for its clinical anxiolytic activity . RATIONALE : DB09000 is a neuroleptic compound which possesses anxiolytic properties in humans . On the other hand , 5- Q9H205 - and P28335 -receptors have been implicated in anxiety disorders and a previous binding study has shown that cyamemazine possesses high affinity for both serotonin receptor types . OBJECTIVE : The present study was undertaken to establish whether cyamemazine antagonizes 5- Q9H205 - and/or P28335 -mediated responses , and whether it compares with reference compounds . METHODS : DB09000 was tested for its ability to antagonize : ( i ) 5- Q9H205 -dependent contraction of the isolated guinea-pig ileum and bradycardic responses in the rat and ( ii ) P28335 -dependent phospholipase C ( P98160 ) stimulation in rat brain membranes . RESULTS : In isolated guinea-pig ileum , cyamemazine potently and competitively antagonized 5-HT-dependent contractions ( pA2 = 7.52 +/- 0.08 ; n = 5 ) . In this test , cyamemazine was 5-7 times more potent ( pIC50 = 6.75 +/- 0.13 ) than tropisetron ( pIC50 = 6.02 +/- 0.04 ) . In rats , cyamemazine i.v. antagonized 5-HT-dependent bradycardic responses with ID50 % = 3.2 +/- 1.5 mg/kg ( n = 4 ) . Finally , in rat brain membranes cyamemazine antagonized P28335 -dependent P98160 stimulation with Ki = 424 nM ( mianserin exhibits a Ki = 113 nM ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB09000 behaves as an antagonist at both 5- Q9H205 - and P28335 -receptors , which compares well with reference compounds . These 5- Q9H205 - and P28335 -antagonistic actions of cyamemazine can be involved , at least in part , in its beneficial therapeutic actions in anxiety disorders . EPO receptor circuits for primary erythroblast survival . EPO functions primarily as an erythroblast survival factor , and its antiapoptotic actions have been proposed to involve predominantly P19957 -kinase and BCL-X pathways . Presently , the nature of EPO-regulated survival genes has been investigated through transcriptome analyses of highly responsive , primary bone marrow erythroblasts . Two proapoptotic factors , Bim and FoxO3a , were rapidly repressed not only via the wild-type P19235 , but also by PY-deficient knocked-in P19235 alleles . In parallel , Pim1 and Pim3 kinases and Irs2 were induced . For this survival gene set , induction failed via a PY-null P19235 -HM allele , but was restored upon reconstitution of a PY343 P42229 -binding site within a related P19235 -H allele . Notably , P19235 -HM supports erythropoiesis at steady state but not during anemia , while P19235 -H exhibits near wild-type P19235 activities . P19235 -H and the wild-type P19235 ( but not P19235 -HM ) also markedly stimulated the expression of Trb3 pseudokinase , and intracellular serpin , Serpina-3G . For SERPINA-3G and TRB3 , ectopic expression in EPO-dependent progenitors furthermore significantly inhibited apoptosis due to cytokine withdrawal . BCL-XL and P10415 also were studied , but in highly responsive Kit(pos)CD71(high)Ter119(neg) erythroblasts , neither was EPO modulated . P19235 survival circuits therefore include the repression of Bim plus FoxO3a , and P19235 /PY343/ P42229 -dependent stimulation of Pim1 , Pim3 , Irs2 plus Serpina-3G , and Trb3 as new antiapoptotic effectors . DB04946 binding to human and rat dopamine and 5-HT receptors . DB04946 ( DB04946 ; 1- [ 4-[3-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl]propoxy] -3- methoxyphenyl ] ethanone ) is a compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia . DB04946 displays affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and for 5- Q13049 receptors and has a variety of in vivo activities suggestive of an atypical antipsychotic . Here we present an examination of the affinity of iloperidone to a variety of human and rat homologs of dopamine and 5-HT receptor subtypes . We employed receptor binding assays using membranes from cells stably expressing human dopamine D1 , D2S , D2L , D3 , D4 and D5 and 5- Q13049 and P28335 receptors and rat P50406 and P34969 receptors . DB04946 displayed higher affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor ( Ki = 7.1 nM ) than for the dopamine D4 receptor ( Ki = 25 nM ) . DB04946 displayed high affinity for the P50406 and P34969 receptors ( Ki = 42.7 and 21.6 nM , respectively ) , and was found to have higher affinity for the 5- Q13049 ( Ki = 5.6 nM ) than for the P28335 receptor ( Ki = 42.8 nM ) . The potential implications of this receptor binding profile are discussed in comparison with data for other antipsychotic compounds . [ Measurement of rifampicin and clarithromycin in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection ] . DB01045 ( RFP ) induces hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes , making drug interactions a very important clinical problem . DB01211 ( P62158 ) metabolism is reportedly enhanced by induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes ( P08684 ) by RFP , so that the blood lend of P62158 decreases when RFP is administered concurrently . We connected an electrochemical detector to a high-performance liquid chromatograph ( HPLC ) for simple , rapid , easy measurement of blood concentrations of RFP and P62158 . Using samples of patient serum , normal serum , and reference standards , we compared HPLC by an external laboratory and the results of LC/MS/MS analysis with those of this new assay . A strong correlation was seen between our HPLC results and those of the external laboratory in RFP levels ( r=0.975 , p < 0.01 ) . A strong correlation was also seen between results we obtained for P62158 with the electrochemical detector in this assay and values measured by LC/MS/MS analysis ( r=0.995 , p < 0.01 ) . Our method enabled simple , rapid measurement of RFP and P62158 by connecting the HPLC and electrochemical detector in tandem . This system was used to modulate dosage during combined therapy with RFP and P62158 . The therapeutic effect for nontuberculous mycobacteriosis is expected to improve , and our HPLC is expected to be useful for simple , rapid , easy measurement of blood concentrations . Gene profiling in Pap-cell smears of high-risk human papillomavirus-positive squamous cervical carcinoma . OBJECTIVE : The purpose of the study was to investigate benign and malignant squamous cervical cells obtained by cervical swabs with regard to differentially expressed genes and gene expression profiling , in order to evaluate the biological behavior and clinical outcome of cervical malignancies . METHODS : Cervical squamous cells from six women with high-risk human papillomavirus positive [ HR-HPV(+) ] cervical carcinoma and from six HPV-negative women with normal ectocervical cells were analyzed by cDNA array . RESULTS : cDNA over-expression of several genes such as MET ( c-met ) , Nm23-H1 ( P15531 ) , P00533 , P21802 , Nm23-H2 ( P22392 ) , P04626 ( c-erbB-2 ) , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 4 ( CDKN2A , P42771 ) , cytokeratin 8 ( P05787 ) , P01116 ( K-ras ) , P17948 , KGF ( P21781 ) , P10415 -like 2 protein ( Q92843 ) , Q15303 , P04198 ( N-myc ) , cyclin D1 ( P24385 ) , P10721 ( c-kit ) , secreted phosphoprotein 1 ( P10451 ) and P42224 , was significant in cervical squamous cell carcinoma ( CSCC ) . Gene expression was downregulated for 13 genes in CSCC , such as interleukin 1 alpha ( P01583 ) , the transforming growth factor receptor beta superfamily ( TGFbeta ; P01137 ) , some members of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) and the integrin family ( P23229 , P05556 ) . CONCLUSION : This study was focused on the gene expression profiling of HR-HPV(-) and ( + ) cervical squamous cells and CSCC obtained by cytobrush . We observed gene expression patterns and signaling pathways that permit the investigator to distinguish between benign squamous cervical cells and CSCC with and without HPV infection . [ Innate resistance to thymidylate synthase inhibition after 5-fluorouracil treatment -- a rationale of combined use of cisplatin and its optimal administration dose ] . We examined the changes of the number of DB00322 MP binding sites of thymidylate thynthase ( TS-BS ) in Yoshida sarcoma after administration of DB00544 to the tumor bearing rats . We also investigated the optimal dose of DB00515 for the increase of intracellular folate level . In the group received consecutive 7-days administration of DB09327 ( U-7 group ) , total TS-BS was significantly increased compared with non-treatment group and the group received only DB09327 ( U-1 group ) . For free TS-BS , however , there was no difference despite of DB09327 administration . P04818 inhibition rate ( TSIR ) was , therefore , significantly high in U-7 group compared with U-1 group . It seemed necessary to take some counter measure for the induction of TS in the tumor tissue when DB00544 chemotherapy was performed . The optimal dose of DB00515 as a modulator of DB00544 was 1 mg/kg in rat when it was estimated from the changes of intracellular folate levels after administration , which was less than the dose to reveal its own anticancer effect . Imatinib restores P50552 activity and its interaction with Q15942 in P11274 - P00519 leukemic cells . P50552 ( P50552 ) and Q15942 are interacting proteins involved in cellular adhesion and motility . PKA phosphorylates P50552 at serine 157 , regulating P50552 cellular functions . P50552 interacts with P00519 and is a substrate of the P11274 - P00519 oncoprotein . The presence of P11274 - P00519 protein drives oncogenesis in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) due to a constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase activity . However , the function of P50552 and Q15942 in P11274 - P00519 pathway and the role of P50552 in CML cells remain unknown . In vitro experiments using K562 cells showed the involvement of P50552 in P11274 - P00519 signaling . P50552 and Q15942 inhibition decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins , P10415 and BCL-XL . Imatinib induced an increase in phosphorylation at Ser157 of P50552 and decreased P50552 and P11274 - P00519 interaction . P50552 did not interact with Q15942 in K562 cells ; however , after Imatinib treatment , this interaction was restored . Corroborating our data , we demonstrated the absence of phosphorylation at Ser157 in P50552 in the bone marrow of CML patients , in contrast to healthy donors . Phosphorylation of P50552 on Ser157 was restored in Imatinib responsive patients though not in the resistant patients . Therefore , we herein identified a possible role of P50552 in CML pathogenesis , through the regulation of P11274 - P00519 effector proteins or the absence of phosphorylation at Ser157 in P50552 . Association of genetic polymorphisms with personality profile in individuals without psychiatric disorders . OBJECTIVE : Population-based twin studies demonstrate that approximately 40-50 % of the variability in personality dimensions results from genetic factors . This study assessed selected polymorphisms in the P21964 Val158Met , P21397 3'VNTR , 5HTTLPR , 102T/C 5- Q13049 , Q01959 3'VNTR and P14416 exon 8 genes and evaluated their association with personality profiles , anxiety levels , and depressiveness in healthy subjects . METHODS : This study included 406 unrelated ( mean age 38.51 years ) , mentally and somatically healthy Caucasian subjects of Polish origin . The prevalence of the gene variants mentioned above and their association with personality profiles , anxiety levels , and depressiveness was assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory , NEO Five-Factor Inventory , Spielberger 's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck 's Depression Inventory . RESULTS : The effects of the 5HTTLPR gene on the s/s genotype and empathy ( P06681 ) were lowest in the entire group . The effects of gender , age and the Q13049 gene for the T/T genotype and attachment ( Q7Z3Z2 ) were highest in women . The effects of gender , age and the Q01959 gene on the 9/9 Q01959 genotype , compassion ( C4 ) and cooperativeness ( C ) were lowest in women . The effects of gender , age and the P21964 gene on the DB00134 / DB00134 genotype and neuroticism ( P04626 ) NEO-FFI were also lowest in women . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest considerable influence of individual genes on the formation of personality traits . Hypoxic/normoxic preconditioning increases endothelial differentiation potential of human bone marrow CD133+ cells . CD133+ cells are hemangioblasts that have capacity to generate into both hematopoietic and endothelial cells ( ECs ) . Hypoxia/normoxia has shown to be the regulator of the balance between stemness and differentiation . In this study we performed Agilent 's whole human genome oligo microarray analysis and examined the differentiation potential of the bone-marrow-derived CD133+ cells after hypoxic/normoxic preconditioning of CD133+ cells . Results showed that there was no significant increase in erythroid colony forming unit ( CFU-E ) and CFU-granulocyte , erythrocyte , monocyte , and megakaryocyte formation with cells treated under hypoxia/normoxia . However , a significant increment of EC forming unit at 24 h ( 143.2 +/- 8.0 % ) compared to 0 h ( 100 +/- 11.4 % ) was observed in CFU-EC analysis . Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining analysis showed that the differentiated cells diminished hematopoietic stem cell surface markers and acquired the gene markers and functional phenotype of ECs . The transcriptome profile revealed a cluster of 232 downregulated and 498 upregulated genes in cells treated for 24 h under hypoxia . The upregulated genes include angiogenic genes , angiogenic growth factor genes , angiogenic cytokine and chemokine genes , as well as angiogenic-positive regulatory genes , including Q14512 , PDGFB , Q16663 , P48061 , P80162 , P05231 , P21246 , O14944 , P04626 , O95136 , P11487 , Q92913 , Q99988 , P05412 , L1CAM , Q02297 , P08138 , and PDGFB . On the other hand , angiogenesis inhibitors and related genes , including P29459 , P98177 , Q9NY15 , and P16035 , are downregulated . Taken together , hypoxic/normoxic preconditioning may lead to the differentiation of CD133+ cells toward endothelial lineage , which may improve the current clinical trial studies . Placental autophagy regulation by the Q9UMX3 - Q07820 rheostat . Autophagy is the catabolic degradation of cellular cytoplasmic constituents via the lysosomal pathway that physiologically elicits a primarily cytoprotective function , but can rapidly be upregulated in response to stressors thereby inducing cell death . We have reported that the balance between the P10415 family proteins Q9UMX3 and Q07820 regulates human trophoblast cell fate and its alteration toward cell death typifies preeclampsia . Here we demonstrate that Q9UMX3 is a potent inducer of autophagy as shown by increased LC3B-II production , autophagosomal formation and lysosomal activation in P29320 293 . In contrast , using JEG3 cells we showed that prosurvival Q07820 acts as a repressor of autophagy via an interaction with Q14457 , which is abrogated by Q9UMX3 . We found that Q07820 -cleaved products , specifically MCL1c157 , trigger autophagy while the splicing variant MCL1S has no effect . Treatment of JEG3 cells with nitric oxide donor SNP resulted in Q9UMX3 - Q07820 rheostat dysregulation , favoring Q9UMX3 accumulation , thereby inducing autophagy . Overexpression of Q07820 rescued oxidative stress-induced autophagy . Of clinical relevance , we report aberrant autophagy levels in the preeclamptic placenta due to impaired recruitment of Q14457 to Q07820 . Our data provided the first evidence for a key role of the Q9UMX3 - Q07820 system in regulating autophagy in the human placenta , whereby an adverse environment as seen in preeclampsia tilts the Q9UMX3 - Q07820 balance toward the build-up of isoforms that triggers placental autophagy . The potential role of PD0332991 ( DB09073 ) in the treatment of multiple myeloma . INTRODUCTION : Multiple myeloma ( MM ) remains an incurable malignancy indicating a need for continued investigation of novel therapies . Recent studies have highlighted the role of cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK ) in the pathogenesis of MM . PD0332991 ( DB09073 ) is an orally bioavailable , highly selective inhibitor of the P11802 /6-cyclin complex and downstream retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) activation pathway that induces cell cycle arrest in the P55008 phase . AREAS COVERED : In this review , the authors summarize the role of the P11802 /6 signaling pathway in MM . They also summarize the development of PD0332991 as a specific inhibitor of P11802 /6 , and the reported preclinical and clinical data supporting the potential role of PD0332991 in MM . EXPERT OPINION : While PD0332991 is essentially cytostatic , inducing prolonged P55008 arrest , it enhances the cytotoxic effect of other agents effective in MM , including bortezomib and lenalidomide , as confirmed in early phase clinical trials . However , with a plethora of other drugs of different classes being tested in MM , further development of PD0332991 will depend on defining the most efficacious combination with least toxicity . An unexplored opportunity remains the potential protective effect of PD0332991 against lytic bone lesions of MM . The next few years are likely to better define the place of PD0332991 in the treatment of MM . Characterization of the inhibitory effects of erythromycin and clarithromycin on the Q12809 potassium channel . Both erythromycin and clarithromycin have been reported to cause QT prolongation and the cardiac arrhythmia torsade de pointes in humans , however direct evidence documenting that these drugs produce this effect by blocking human cardiac ion channels is lacking . The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that these macrolide antibiotics significantly block the delayed rectifier current ( IKr ) encoded by Q12809 ( the human ether-a-go-go-related gene ) at drug concentrations , temperature and ionic conditions mimicking those occurring in human subjects . DB01345 currents in P29320 293 cells stably transfected with Q12809 were recorded using a whole cell voltage clamp method . Exposure of cells to erythromycin reduced the Q12809 encoded potassium current in a concentration dependent manner with an IC50 of 38.9 +/- 1.2 microM and Hill Slope factor of 0.4 +/- 0.1 . DB01211 produced a similar concentration-dependent block with an IC50 of 45.7 +/- 1.1 microM and Hill Slope factor of 1.0 +/- 0.1 . Erythromycin ( 25-250 microM ) and clarithromycin ( 5 or 25 microM ) also produced a significant decrease in the integral of the current evoked by an action potential shaped voltage clamp protocol . The results of this study document that both erythromycin and clarithromycin significantly inhibit the Q12809 potassium current at clinically relevant concentrations . Drug insight : Use of docetaxel in prostate and urothelial cancers . Taxanes have emerged as a potent class of chemotherapeutic agents in many malignancies , with two taxanes now in clinical use . Their mechanism of action against tumor cells is by alteration of microtubule dynamics , which causes cell-cycle arrest during mitosis . DB01248 binds to the microtubules with a higher affinity than paclitaxel , and over a broader range of cell-cycle activities . It has also been shown to promote apoptosis via P10415 phosphorylation . In hormone-refractory prostate cancer , docetaxel has been studied as both a single agent and in combination with estramustine , and in different treatment schedules , with demonstrated efficacy . Two phase III trials have confirmed a survival benefit , making docetaxel the first chemotherapy agent with proven efficacy against prostate cancer . In urothelial cancer , docetaxel has demonstrated activity and has been investigated as a single agent and in combination regimens . A phase III trial comparing docetaxel and cisplatin to methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin , and cisplatin was inferior when evaluating response rates and overall survival . More recent phase II trials combining docetaxel with two additional agents have shown promise , but confirmatory trials are needed . P10275 expression in breast cancer patients tested for P38398 and P51587 mutations . AIM : To assess the expression of receptors for androgen ( AR ) , oestrogen ( ER ) and progesterone ( PR ) as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( Her-2/neu ) status of breast carcinomas in breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA ) P38398 /2 mutation carriers and P38398 /2 negative tested women . METHODS : One hundred and thirty-five breast cancers in women tested for P38398 /2 mutations . Screening for P38398 and P51587 mutations was performed by direct sequencing of all P38398 and P51587 exons as well as the surrounding intronic sequences . Additionally , BRCA genes were analysed with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification . Consecutive paraffin sections were examined immunohistochemically for AR , ER , PR and Her-2/neu . RESULTS : Of the 135 tumours , 43 ( 32 % ) were P38398 -related , 18 ( 13 % ) were P51587 -related and 74 ( 55 % ) were P38398 /2-negative . Seventy-two per cent of the P38398 -related , 22 % of the P51587 -related and 12 % of the P38398 /2-negative tumours were triple ( ER , PR , Her2neu ) -negative . Eighty-four per cent of P38398 mutated cancers were high-grade ( P46379 ) tumours . ARs were expressed in 30 % ( 13 of 43 ) of P38398 -related , in 78 % ( 14 of 18 ) in P51587 -related tumours and in 76 % ( 56 of 74 ) in P38398 /2 negative tumours . Twenty-one per cent of ER-negative P38398 -related tumours expressed androgen receptors . CONCLUSION : Approximately one in five P38398 mutated breast cancers negative for ER and PR express androgen receptors . Modulation of AR might open a new avenue for treating these high-risk cancers . Effects of dutasteride on the expression of genes related to androgen metabolism and related pathway in human prostate cancer cell lines . Androgens play an important role in controlling the growth of the normal prostate gland and in the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia , and prostate cancer . Although testosterone is the main androgen secreted from the testes , dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) , a more potent androgen converted from testosterone by 5alpha-reductase isozymes , type I and II , is the major androgen in the prostate cells . The aim of this study is to investigate the cellular and molecular effects of dutasteride , a potent inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase type I and type II , in androgen-responsive ( LNCaP ) and androgen-unresponsive ( DU145 ) human prostate cancer(PCa) cell lines . The expression pattern of 190 genes , selected on the basis of their proved or potential role in prostate cancerogenesis related to androgen signalling , were analysed using a low density home-made oligoarray ( AndroChip 2 ) . Our results show that dutasteride reduces cell viability and cell proliferation in both cell lines tested . AndroChip 2 gene signature identified in LNCaP a total of 11 genes differentially expressed ( FC > or= +/-1.5 ) . Eight of these genes , were overexpressed and three were underexpressed . Overexpressed genes included genes encoding for proteins involved in biosynthesis and metabolism of androgen ( P14061 ; P37058 ; P19099 ) , androgen receptor and androgen receptor co-regulators ( AR; P24385 ) , and signal transduction ( P04626 ; V- P62158 ; Q07889 ) whereas , underexpressed genes ( KLK3 ; P20151 ; Q15392 ) were androgen-regulated genes ( ARGs ) . No differentially expressed genes were scored in DU145 . Microarray data were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assay ( QRT-PCR ) . These data offer a selective genomic signature for dutasteride treatment in prostate epithelial cells and provide important insights in prostate cancer pathophysiology . DB09073 ( PD 0332991 ) : targeting the cell cycle machinery in breast cancer . INTRODUCTION : The cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 ( P11802 /6 ) -retinoblastoma ( P06400 ) pathway , governing the cell cycle restriction point , is frequently altered in breast cancer and is a potentially relevant target for anticancer therapy . DB09073 ( PD 0332991 ) , a potent and selective inhibitor of P11802 and Q00534 , inhibits proliferation of several P06400 -positive cancer cell lines and xenograft models . AREAS COVERED : The basic features and abnormalities of the cell cycle in breast cancer are described , along with their involvement in estrogen signaling and endocrine resistance . The pharmacological features of palbociclib , its activity in preclinical models of breast cancer and the potential determinants of response are then illustrated , and its clinical development in breast cancer described . A literature search on the topic was conducted through PubMed and the proceedings of the main cancer congresses of recent years . EXPERT OPINION : The combination of palbociclib with endocrine agents is a very promising treatment and Phase III clinical trials are ongoing to confirm its efficacy . Further , potentially useful combinations are those with drugs targeting mitogenic signaling pathways , such as P04626 - and PI3K-inhibitors . Combination with chemotherapy seems more problematic , as antagonism has been reported in preclinical models . The identification of predictive factors , already explored in preclinical studies , must be further refined and validated in clinical trials . ' VASPFix ' for measurement of P50552 phosphorylation in platelets and for monitoring effects of Q9H244 antagonists . P50552 ( P50552 ) is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated consequent to increases and decreases in cyclic nucleotide levels . Monitoring changes in P50552 phosphorylation is an established method for indirect measurement of cyclic nucleotides . Here we describe the use of an innovative cocktail , VASPFix , which allows sensitive and reproducible measurement of phosphorylated P50552 ( P50552 -P ) in a simple , single-step procedure using cytometric bead technology . Frozen VASPFix-treated samples are stable for at least six months prior to analysis . We successfully used VASPFix to measure P50552 -P in platelets in both platelet-rich plasma and blood in response to compounds that increase ( dibutyryl DB02527 , adenosine , iloprost , PGE1 ) and decrease ( ADP , PGE1 ) DB02527 , and to determine the effects of certain receptor antagonists on the results obtained . The change in P50552 -P brought about by adding ADP to PGE1-stimulated platelets is a combination of the effect of ADP at the Q9H244 receptor and of PGE1 at both IP and EP3 receptors . For iloprost-stimulated platelets EP3 receptors are not involved . A procedure in which iloprost , ADP and VASPFix were used to determine effectiveness of clopidogrel and prasugrel in patients was compared with an established commercial procedure that uses PGE1 and ADP ; the latter produced higher platelet reactivity values that were the result of PGE1 interacting with platelet EP3 receptors . We conclude that VASPFix can be used both as a research tool and for clinical investigations and provides better specificity for Q9H244 receptor inhibition . The latter confers a distinct advantage over existing methods used to monitor effects of Q9H244 antagonists on platelet function . The P28335 receptor agonist lorcaserin reduces nicotine self-administration , discrimination , and reinstatement : relationship to feeding behavior and impulse control . DB04871 ( ( 1R ) -8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine HCl ) is a selective 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist with clinical efficacy in phase-III obesity trials . Based on evidence that this drug class also affects behaviors motivated by drug reinforcement , we compared the effect of lorcaserin on behavior maintained by food and nicotine reinforcement , as well as the stimulant and discriminative stimulus properties of nicotine in the rat . Acutely administered lorcaserin ( 0.3-3 mg/kg , subcutaneous ( SC ) ) dose dependently reduced feeding induced by 22-h food deprivation or palatability . Effects up to 1 mg/kg were consistent with a specific effect on feeding motivation . DB04871 ( 0.6-1 mg/kg , SC ) reduced operant responding for food on progressive and fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement . In this dose range lorcaserin also reversed the motor stimulant effect of nicotine , reduced intravenous self-administration of nicotine , and attenuated the nicotine cue in rats trained to discriminate nicotine from saline . DB04871 also reduced the reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior elicited by a compound cue comprising a nicotine prime and conditioned stimulus previously paired with nicotine reinforcement . DB04871 did not reinstate nicotine-seeking behavior or substitute for a nicotine cue . Finally , lorcaserin ( 0.3-1 mg/kg ) reduced nicotine-induced increases in anticipatory responding , a measure of impulsive action , in rats performing the five-choice serial reaction time task . Importantly , these results indicate that lorcaserin , and likely other selective 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists , similarly affect both food- and nicotine-motivated behaviors , and nicotine-induced impulsivity . Collectively , these findings highlight a therapeutic potential for 5-HT(2C) agonists such as lorcaserin beyond obesity into addictive behaviors , such as nicotine dependence . Gq-mediated Akt translocation to the membrane : a novel PIP3-independent mechanism in platelets . Akt is an important signaling molecule regulating platelet aggregation . Akt is phosphorylated after translocation to the membrane through Gi signaling pathways by a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) -dependent mechanism . However , Akt is more robustly phosphorylated by thrombin compared with adenosine 5'-diphosphate in platelets . This study investigated the mechanisms of Akt translocation as a possible explanation for this difference . Stimulation of washed human platelets with protease-activated receptor agonists caused translocation of Akt to the membrane rapidly , whereas phosphorylation occurred later . The translocation of Akt was abolished in the presence of a Gq-selective inhibitor or in Gq-deficient murine platelets , indicating that Akt translocation is regulated downstream of Gq pathways . Interestingly , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors or Q9H244 antagonist abolished Akt phosphorylation without affecting Akt translocation to the membrane , suggesting that Akt translocation occurs through a PI3K/PIP3/Gi-independent mechanism . An Akt scaffolding protein , P38936 -activated kinase ( PAK ) , translocates to the membrane after stimulation with protease-activated receptor agonists in a Gq-dependent manner , with the kinetics of translocation similar to that of Akt . Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed constitutive association of PAK and Akt , suggesting a possible role of PAK in Akt translocation . These results show , for the first time , an important role of the Gq pathway in mediating Akt translocation to the membrane in a novel Gi/PI3K/PIP3-independent mechanism . P35367 occupancy in human brains after single oral doses of histamine H1 antagonists measured by positron emission tomography . 1. P35367 occupancy in the human brain was measured in 20 healthy young men by positron emission tomography ( PET ) using [ 11C ] -doxepin . 2 . (+)- DB01114 , a selective and classical antihistamine , occupied 76.8 +/- 4.2 % of the averaged values of available histamine H1 receptors in the frontal cortex after its administration in a single oral dose of 2 mg . Intravenous administration of 5 mg (+)-chlorpheniramine almost completely abolished the binding of [ 11C ] -doxepin to H1 receptors ( H1 receptor occupancy : 98.2 +/- 1.2 % ) . 3 . Terfenadine , a nonsedative antihistamine , occupied 17.2 +/- 14.2 % of the available H1 receptors in the human frontal cortex after its administration in a single oral dose of 60 mg . 4 . There was no correlation between H1 receptor occupancy by terfenadine and the plasma concentration of the active acid metabolite of terfenadine in each subject . 5 . PET data on human brain were essentially compatible with those on H1 receptor occupancy in guinea-pig brain determined by in vivo binding techniques , although for the same H1 receptor occupancy the dose was less in human subjects than in guinea-pigs . 6 . The PET studies demonstrated the usefulness of measuring H1 receptor occupancy with classical and second-generation antihistamines in human brain to estimate their unwanted side effects such as sedation and drowsiness quantitatively . 5-Azacitidine restores and amplifies the bicalutamide response on preclinical models of androgen receptor expressing or deficient prostate tumors . BACKGROUND : Epigenetic modifications play a key role in the in prostate cancer ( Pca ) progression to a hormone refractory state ( HRPC ) and the current use of agents targeting epigenetic changes has become a topic of intense interest in cancer research . In this regard , 5-Azacitine ( 5-Aza ) represents a promising epigenetic modulator . This study tested the hypothesis that 5-Aza may restore and enhance the responsiveness of HRPC cells to anti-hormonal therapy on P10275 ( AR ) expressing ( 22rv1 ) and AR-deficient ( PC3 ) cells . METHODS : The effects were studied in vitro and in vivo models . This sequential treatment induced in vitro cell cycle arrest and apoptosis both in 22rv1 and PC3 tumor cell lines . RESULTS : This combined treatment up-regulated the expression of P48023 , phospho- Q13158 , p16(INKA) , Bax , Bak , and P38936 ( P38936 ) , and inhibited FLIP , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-XL expression . The re-activation of hormonal response of AR-negative PC3 cell line was partially due to the AR re-expression mediated by 5-Aza treatment . In contrast , the increase in the response to anti-androgenic therapy in 22rv1 did not correlate with AR expression levels . Furthermore , xenograft studies revealed that the combined treatment of 5-Aza with AR-antagonist DB01128 had additive/synergistic effects in repressing tumor growth in vivo and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects seem to be in part mediated by induction of apoptosis . CONCLUSIONS : So , this study strongly suggests a therapeutic potential of 5-Aza in combination with anti-androgen therapy in patients with in AR expressing and AR-deficient HRPC . Modulation of a Mr 175,000 c-neu receptor isoform in Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells by serum starvation . The neu proto-oncogene product has been found to exist in two interconvertible forms in Q9UBA6 / P00374 mouse fibroblasts . The 185-kilodalton form ( p185 ) present in growing cells is replaced by a 175-kilodalton form ( p175 ) under conditions of serum starvation . This low molecular weight form accounts almost exclusively for the phosphotyrosine content of the receptor and is associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity . Addition of serum , platelet-derived growth factor or tumor promoter induces conversion of p175 to p185 within minutes , and this increase in molecular weight is associated with phosphorylation of serine and threonine ; removal of serum growth factors is followed by replacement of p185 with p175 over several hours . Unlike Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells , the human breast cancer cell line SK-Br-3 expresses a high molecular weight neu/ P04626 receptor with unchanged phosphotyrosine content in both serum-starved and serum-stimulated cultures . These findings indicate that activation of the neu proto-oncogene product in Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells may be regulated in part by protein kinase C-mediated receptor transmodulation rather than by ligand availability alone . PPARgamma activation abolishes LDL-induced proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells via SOD-mediated down-regulation of superoxide . Native LDL would be a mitogenic and chemotactic stimulus of VSMC proliferation and differentiation in the atherosclerotic lesion where endothelial disruption occurred . In previous studies , our group investigated the molecular mechanisms by which LDL induces P10145 production and by which PPARalpha activation abolishes LDL effects in human aortic SMCs ( hAoSMCs ) . Herein is the first report of PPARgamma activation by troglitazone ( TG ) exerting its inhibitory effects on LDL-induced cell proliferation via generation not of H(2)O(2) , but of O2(.-) , and the subsequent activation of Erk1/2 in hAoSMCs . Moreover , in this study TG abolished the LDL-accelerated G(1)-S progression to control levels via down-regulation of active cyclinD1/ P11802 and cyclinE/ P24941 complexes and up-regulation of P38936 (Cip1) expression . TG exerted its anti-proliferative effects through the up-regulation of basal superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) expression . This data suggests that the regulation of O2(.-) is located at the crossroads between LDL signaling and cell proliferation . Systems pharmacology assessment of the 5-fluorouracil pathway . AIM : To assess the impact of the 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) drug-pathway genes on cytotoxicity , and determine whether loss-of-function analyses coupled with functional assays can help prioritize pharmacogenomic candidate genes . MATERIALS & METHODS : Dose-response experiments were used to quantify the phenotype of sensitivity to DB00544 following the specific knockdown of genes selected from the DB00544 PharmGKB drug pathway in three human colorectal cell lines . Changes in sensitivity were considered significant if the IC(50) for shRNA-exposed cells were three standard deviations outside the mean IC(50) for control-treated cells . RESULTS : Of the 24 genes analyzed , 13 produced significant changes on the phenotype of sensitivity to DB00544 ( P00374 , Q14117 , P23919 , P33316 , Q05932 , Q92820 , P15531 , Q8TCD5 , P23921 , P04818 , Q9BZX2 , P13051 and P11172 ) . CONCLUSION : The RNAi screening strategy enabled prioritization of the genes from the DB00544 drug pathway . Further validation of the genes credentialed in this study should include gene activity or expression and mutation analyses of clinical samples .
Signatures of positive selection in genes associated with human skin pigmentation as revealed from analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms . Phenotypic variation between human populations in skin pigmentation correlates with latitude at the continental level . A large number of hypotheses involving genetic adaptation have been proposed to explain human variation in skin colour , but only limited genetic evidence for positive selection has been presented . To shed light on the evolutionary genetic history of human variation in skin colour we inspected 118 genes associated with skin pigmentation in the Perlegen dataset , studying single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , and analyzed 55 genes in detail . We identified eight genes that are associated with the melanin pathway ( Q9UMX9 , Q04671 , P17643 , P40126 , P21583 , P00533 , P14416 and Q03181 ) and presented significant differences in genetic variation between Europeans , Africans and Asians . In six of these genes we detected , by means of the EHH test , variability patterns that are compatible with the hypothesis of local positive selection in Europeans ( Q04671 , P17643 and P21583 ) and in Asians ( Q04671 , P40126 , P21583 , P00533 and P14416 ) , whereas signals were scarce in Africans ( P40126 , P00533 and P14416 ) . Furthermore , a statistically significant correlation between genotypic variation in four pigmentation candidate genes and phenotypic variation of skin colour in 51 worldwide human populations was revealed . Overall , our data also suggest that light skin colour is the derived state and is of independent origin in Europeans and Asians , whereas dark skin color seems of unique origin , reflecting the ancestral state in humans . DB00316 -inhibitable P35354 . Although paracetamol potently reduces pain and fever , its mechanism of action has so far not been satisfactorily explained . It inhibits both P23219 and P35354 weakly in vitro , but reduces prostaglandin synthesis markedly in vivo . In mouse macrophage J774.2 cells , P35354 induced for 48 hr with high concentrations of NSAIDs is more sensitive to inhibition with paracetamol than endotoxin-induced P35354 . In the rat pleurisy model of inflammation , a second peak of P35354 protein appears 48 hr after administration of the inflammatory stimulus , during the resolution phase of the inflammatory process . Inhibition of the activity of this late-appearing P35354 with indomethacin or a selective P35354 inhibitor , delays resolution and the inflammation is prolonged . Cultured lung fibroblasts also express P35354 activity after stimulation with IL-1beta which is highly sensitive to inhibition with paracetamol . Thus , evidence is accumulating for the existence of a P35354 variant or a new P36551 enzyme which can be inhibited with paracetamol . Fibroblast growth factor-2 in hyperplastic pituitaries of D2R knockout female mice . P14416 ( D2R ) knockout ( KO ) female mice develop chronic hyperprolactinemia and pituitary hyperplasia . Our objective was to study the expression of the mitogen fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) and its receptor , P11362 , comparatively in pituitaries from KO and wild-type ( WT ) female mice . We also evaluated P09038 subcellular localization and P09038 effects on pituitary function . P09038 -induced prolactin release showed a similar response pattern in both genotypes , even though basal and P09038 -stimulated release was higher in KO . P09038 stimulated pituitary cellular proliferation ( MTS assay and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation ) , with no differences between genotypes . P09038 concentration ( measured by ELISA ) in whole pituitaries or cultured cells was lower in KO ( P < 0.00001 and 0.00014 ) . Immunofluorescence histochemistry showed less P09038 in pituitaries from KO females and revealed a distinct P09038 localization pattern between genotypes , being predominantly nuclear in KO and cytosolic in WT pituitaries . Finally , P09038 could not be detected in the conditioned media from pituitary cultures of both genotypes . P11362 levels ( Western blot and immunohistochemistry ) were higher in pituitaries of KO . Basal concentration of phosphorylated ERKs was lower in KO cells ( P = 0.018 ) . However , when stimulated with P09038 , a significantly higher increment of P29323 phosphorylation was evidenced in KO cells ( P < or = 0.02 ) . We conclude that disruption of the D2R caused an overall decrease in pituitary P09038 levels , with an increased distribution in the nucleus , and increased P11362 levels . These results are important in the search for reliable prognostic indicators for patients with pituitary dopamine-resistant prolactinomas , which will make tumor-specific therapy possible . A genomic insight into diversity among tribal and nontribal population groups of Manipur , India . Twenty autosomal markers , including linked markers at two gene markers , are used to understand the genomic similarity and diversity among three tribal ( Paite , Thadou , and Kom ) and one nontribal communities of Manipur ( Northeast India ) . Two of the markers ( P01730 and HB9 ) are monomorphic in Paite and one ( the P01730 marker ) in Kom . Data suggest the Meitei ( nontribal groups ) stand apart from the three tribal groups with respect to higher heterozygosity ( 0.366 ) and presence of the highest ancestor haplotypes of P14416 markers ( 0.228 ) ; this is also supported by principal co-ordinate analysis . These populations are found to be genomically closer to the Chinese population than to other Indian populations . Serotonin and dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms and the risk of extrapyramidal side effects in perphenazine-treated schizophrenic patients . RATIONALE : DB00850 , a classical antipsychotic drug , has the potential to induce extrapyramidal side effects ( EPS ) . Dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways are involved in the therapeutic and adverse effects of the drug . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the impact of polymorphisms in the dopamine D(2) and D(3) and serotonin 2A and 2C receptor genes ( P14416 , P35462 , P28223 , and P28335 ) on short-term effects of perphenazine monotherapy in schizophrenic patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Forty-seven Estonian inpatients were evaluated before and after 4-6 weeks of treatment by Simpson-Angus rating scale , Barnes scale , and Positive and Negative Symptom Scale . Genotyping was performed for common P14416 , P35462 , P28223 , and P28335 gene polymorphisms , previously reported to influence receptor expression and/or function . RESULTS : Most of the patients ( n = 37 ) responded to the treatment and no significant association was observed between the polymorphisms and antipsychotic response . The 102C allele of P28223 and the -697C and 23Ser alleles of P28335 were more frequent among patients with EPS ( n = 25 ) compared to patients without EPS ( n = 22 ) ( p = 0.02 , 0.01 , and 0.02 , respectively ) . The difference between patients with and without EPS in variant allele frequencies remained significant after multiple model analyses including age , gender , and duration of antipsychotic treatment as covariants . There was no significant association between EPS occurrence and polymorphisms in the P14416 and P35462 genes . CONCLUSIONS : An association was observed between polymorphisms in P28223 and P28335 genes and occurrence of acute EPS in schizophrenic patients treated with perphenazine monotherapy . Larger study populations are needed to confirm our findings . The relationship between gastric motility and nausea : gastric prokinetic agents as treatments . Nausea is one of a cluster of symptoms described subjectively by patients with delayed gastric emptying . The mechanisms and treatments are unclear ( anti-emetic drugs are not fully effective against nausea ) . Can nausea be relieved by stimulating gastric emptying ? Physostigmine ( together with atropine ) has been shown experimentally to stimulate gastric motility , relieve nausea and restore normal gastric motility . Is this mimicked by gastric prokinetic drugs ? The answer is complicated by mixed pharmacology . DB01233 increases gastric motility by activating myenteric Q13639 receptors but also directly inhibits vomiting via D2 and 5- Q9H205 receptor antagonism ; relationships between increased gastric motility and relief from nausea are therefore unclear . Similarly , the D2 receptor antagonist domperidone has direct anti-emetic activity . Nevertheless , more selective Q13639 and motilin receptor agonists ( erythromycin , directly stimulating gastric motility ) inhibit vomiting in animals ; low doses of erythromycin can also relieve symptoms in patients with gastroparesis . Ghrelin stimulates gastric motility and appetite mostly via vagus-dependent pathways , and inhibits vomiting in animals . To date , ghrelin receptor activation has failed to consistently improve gastric emptying or symptoms in patients with gastroparesis . We conclude that nausea can be relieved by gastric prokinetic drugs , but more clinical studies are needed using drugs with selective activity . Other mechanisms ( e.g. ghrelin , vagal and central pathways , influencing a mechanistic continuum between appetite and nausea ) also require exploration . These and other issues will be further explored in a forthcoming special issue of the European Journal of Pharmacology , which focusses on mechanisms of nausea and vomiting . P04035 inhibition induces IL-1beta release through Rac1/PI3K/ P31749 -dependent caspase-1 activation . Q03426 deficiency ( MKD ) is an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurring fever episodes and results from disturbed isoprenoid biosynthesis . Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MKD patients secrete high levels of interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) because of the presence of hyperactive caspase-1 , and this has been proposed to be the primary cause of recurring inflammation . Here we show that inhibition of P04035 by simvastatin treatment , mimicking MKD , results in increased IL-1beta secretion in a Rac1/PI3K-dependent manner . Simvastatin treatment was found to activate protein kinase B ( P31749 ) /c-akt , a primary effector of PI3K , and ectopic expression of constitutively active P31749 was sufficient to induce IL-1beta release . The small GTPase Rac1 was activated by simvastatin , and this was required for both P31749 activation and IL-1beta secretion . IL-1beta release is mediated by caspase-1 , and simvastatin treatment resulted in increased caspase-1 activity in a Rac1/PI3K-dependent manner . These data suggest that , in MKD , dysregulated isoprenoid biosynthesis activates Rac1/PI3K/ P31749 , resulting in caspase-1 activation with increased IL-1beta release . Importantly , inhibition of Rac1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from MKD patients resulted in a dramatic reduction in IL-1beta release . These data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of Rac1 could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of MKD . Single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs ) enhance DB00761 - , acetylcholine- , and serotonin-induced contractions and evoke oxidative stress on rabbit ileum . We examined the effects of intravenous administration of purified arc-discharge single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs ) on rabbit ileum to establish the possibility of using these SWCNTs as cell markers or drug carriers for the treatment of intestinal diseases . The SWCNT purification process eliminated carbonaceous impurities and decreased the amount of metals . SWCNTs increased the contractile responses induced by DB00761 , acetylcholine ( ACh ) , and serotonin ( 5-HT ) in rabbit ileum . Verapamil , apamin , glibenclamide , quinine and charybdotoxin reduced the contractile responses induced by ACh and 5-HT in ileum from rabbits treated with SWCNTs , indicating that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and small , intermediate , and large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated , DB00171 -sensitive , and voltage-dependent K+ channels are involved in these effects . Atropine and hexamethonium reduced the ACh response , indicating that muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are involved in this effect . DB00904 and GR 113808 reduced the 5-HT response , indicating that serotonin 5- Q9H205 and Q13639 receptors are involved in this effect . SWCNTs increased the malondialdehyde plus 4-hydroxyalkenals and carbonyl levels in rabbit plasma and ileum , indicating that SWCNTs produce oxidative stress . SWCNTs did not produce relevant histological changes or modify the levels of the inflammatory mediators P35228 and P35354 in the ileum . In conclusion , this study demonstrates that the intravenous administration of SWCNTs can evoke oxidative stress and affect contractility in rabbit ileum . These effects could reduce the possibility of using the arc-discharge SWCNTs as cell markers or drug carriers to treat intestinal diseases . Allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 40 candidate genes for gene-environment studies on cancer : data from population-based Japanese random samples . Knowledge of genetic polymorphisms in gene-environment studies may contribute to more accurate identification of avoidable risks and to developing tailor-made preventative measures . The aim of this study was to describe the allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of select genes , which may be included in future gene-environment studies on cancer in Japan . SNP typing was performed on middle-aged Japanese men randomly selected from the general population in five areas of Japan . We genotyped and calculated allele frequencies of 153 SNPs located on 40 genes : P04798 , Q16678 , P11712 , P33261 , P05181 , P05093 , P11511 , P35869 , P03372 , Q92731 , ERRRG , P06401 , P07099 , P34913 , P37059 , P37058 , P28161 , P21266 , GSTT2 , P09211 , NAT1 , NAT2 , P21964 , P07327 , P00325 , P00326 , P05091 , P35228 , NOS3 , P01583 , P01584 , O15527 , P36639 [ P36639 ] , P14416 , P35462 , P21917 , P31645 , P04150 [ GCCR ] , P42898 , and P15559 . In the present study , the Japanese allele frequencies were verified by using nationwide population samples . Evaluation of DNA damage in P48444 patients and its correlation with polymorphisms in repair genes . BACKGROUND : We investigated a potential link between genetic polymorphisms in genes P18887 ( Arg399Gln ) , O15527 ( Ser326Cys ) , O43542 ( Thr241Met ) , and Q13426 ( Ile401Thr ) with the level of DNA damage and repair , accessed by comet and micronucleus test , in 51 P48444 patients and 51 controls . METHODS : Peripheral blood was used to perform the alkaline and neutral comet assay ; and genetic polymorphisms by PCR/RFLP . To assess the susceptibility to exogenous DNA damage , the cells were treated with methyl methanesulphonate for 1-h or 3-h . After 3-h treatment the % residual damage was calculated assuming the value of 1-h treatment as 100 % . The cytogenetic damage was evaluated by buccal micronucleus cytome assay ( BMCyt ) . RESULTS : P48444 patients with the risk allele P18887 ( Arg399Gln ) and O43542 ( Thr241Met ) showed higher DNA damage by comet assay . The residual damage was higher for P48444 with risk allele in the four genes . In P48444 patients was showed negative correlation between BMCyt ( binucleated , nuclear bud , condensed chromatin and karyorrhexic cells ) with pulmonary function and some variant genotypes . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest a possible association between variant genotypes in P18887 ( Arg399Gln ) , O15527 ( Ser326Cys ) , O43542 ( Thr241Met ) , and Q13426 ( Ile401Thr ) , DNA damage and progression of P48444 . Effects of cholinoceptor and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonism on erythromycin-induced canine intestinal motility disruption and emesis . 1. Erythromycin administration is associated with gastrointestinal problems , disturbed gastrointestinal motility and emesis . This study in the dog investigates the underlying mechanisms . 2 . Intestinal myoelectrical activity and the occurrence and latency of emesis were recorded in eight conscious dogs . All drugs were administered intravenously . 3 . Erythromycin ( 7 mg kg-1 ) increased contractions of the proximal small intestine , and caused emesis in all fasted dogs and in 5 dogs after food . Atropine ( 50 mg kg-1 min-1 ) and hexamethonium ( 10 mg kg-1 h-1 ) partially inhibited the GI motility effects but did not significantly reduce emesis . 4 . DB01233 at a high dose ( 2 mg kg-1 h-1 ) reduced the incidence of emesis in the presence of increased intestinal motility , but a low dose ( 150 micrograms kg-1 h-1 ) was ineffective . 5 . A 5-hydroxytryptamine3 ( 5- Q9H205 ) receptor antagonist , MDL 72222 ( 1 mg kg-1 ) , reduced emesis when given alone and combined with metoclopramide ( low dose ) . The Q13639 receptor agonist BRL24924 ( DB04917 , 1 mg kg-1 ) had no effect on emesis either alone in combination with metoclopramide . 6 . In conclusion , erythromycin-induced GI motility disturbances and emesis are not causally related . Whereas the increase in intestinal smooth muscle activity is possibly cholinergically mediated , emesis occurs at least in part via a 5-hydroxytryptaminergic mechanism , but does not involve the dopamine system . DB00175 -induced proangiogenic effects depend upon extracellular P09038 . The P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) have been shown to exert several protective effects on the vasculature that are unrelated to changes in the cholesterol profile , and to induce angiogenesis . The proangiogenic effect exerted by statins has been attributed to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in endothelial cells ; however , it is unclear how statins activate this pathway . DB00175 -mediated activation of Akt and MAPK occurs rapidly ( within 10 min. ) and at low doses ( 10 nM ) . Here , we hypothesized that P09038 contributes to the proangiogenic effect of statins . We found that pravastatin , a hydrophilic statin , induced phosphorylation of the FGF receptor ( FGFR ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . SU5402 , an inhibitor of FGFR , abolished pravastatin-induced PI3K/Akt and MAPK activity . Likewise , anti- P09038 function-blocking antibodies inhibited Akt and MAPK activity . Moreover , depletion of extracellular P09038 by heparin prevented pravastatin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK . Treatment with P09038 antibody inhibited pravastatin-enhanced endothelial cell proliferation , migration and tube formation . These observations indicate that pravastatin exerts proangiogenic effects in endothelial cells depending upon the extracellular P09038 . P04035 inhibitors deplete circulating classical and non-classical monocytes following human heart transplantation . BACKGROUND : Monocytes mediate immune responses following solid organ transplantation via cytokine secretion and differentiation to macrophage/dendritic cell lineages . To date , the pleiotropic immunomodulatory effect of statins on human monocytes following human heart transplantation has yet to be elucidated . This study was designed to assess the effects of statin administration on the monocyte repertoire . METHODS : 108 patients were recruited into the study . Clinical data were collected from patients ' notes . Peripheral blood immunophenotype was determined via flow cytometry ( using CD11c , P08571 , CD16 , CD49d , CD64 , P33681 and CD195 ) . RESULTS : There were fewer circulating classical ( p=0.0001 ) and non-classical ( p=0.0013 ) monocytes in patients treated with a statin . CD64 expression was down-regulated ( p=0.011 and p=0.049 ) whereas CD49d expression was up-regulated ( p=0.004 and p=0.022 ) on classical and non-classical monocytes in this group . Patients receiving DB01076 had fewer circulating classical monocytes ( p=0.001 ) compared to patients administered DB00175 . Patients receiving DB00175 had fewer circulating non-classical monocytes ( p=0.029 ) compared to patients administered DB01076 . DISCUSSION : Statin administration alters the circulating monocyte repertoire following heart transplantation , including population size , FcgammaRI and VLA-4 adhesion molecule expression . Furthermore , different statin treatments are associated with a selective depletion of macrophage or DC (re)generating monocytes . A whole genome Bayesian scan for adaptive genetic divergence in West African cattle . BACKGROUND : The recent settlement of cattle in West Africa after several waves of migration from remote centres of domestication has imposed dramatic changes in their environmental conditions , in particular through exposure to new pathogens . West African cattle populations thus represent an appealing model to unravel the genome response to adaptation to tropical conditions . The purpose of this study was to identify footprints of adaptive selection at the whole genome level in a newly collected data set comprising 36,320 SNPs genotyped in 9 West African cattle populations . RESULTS : After a detailed analysis of population structure , we performed a scan for SNP differentiation via a previously proposed Bayesian procedure including extensions to improve the detection of loci under selection . Based on these results we identified 53 genomic regions and 42 strong candidate genes . Their physiological functions were mainly related to immune response ( MHC region which was found under strong balancing selection , P11912 , P61073 , P80370 , P48380 , Q9H3S1 , Q8IUC6 and P19474 ) , nervous system ( Q96NK8 , O95897 , MAGI1 , Q9H3S1 and Q13639 ) and skin and hair properties ( P24530 , TRSP1 and Q8IUC2 ) . CONCLUSION : The main possible underlying selective pressures may be related to climatic conditions but also to the host response to pathogens such as Trypanosoma(sp) . Overall , these results might open the way towards the identification of important variants involved in adaptation to tropical conditions and in particular to resistance to tropical infectious diseases . Higher levels of activation markers and chemokine receptors on T lymphocytes in the cervix than peripheral blood of normal healthy women . Heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) is the predominant mode of infection world-wide . To better understand sexual transmission of HIV-1 in women we have analysed virus co-receptor and cellular activation marker expression on T lymphocyte subsets from the cervical epithelium and have made comparisons with peripheral blood T cells . Intraepithelial cervical T lymphocytes were obtained with a cytobrush , immunolabelled and analysed by flow cytometry . Activation markers ( Q07108 , CD25 and HLA-DR ) were found to be more highly expressed on cervical than on blood T lymphocytes . These higher levels of activation on cervical T lymphocyte subsets could facilitate HIV-1 infection . P61073 was expressed at marginally higher levels than P51681 on T cells from the cervical epithelium and peripheral blood . Thus , the preferential transmission of macrophage tropic strains of HIV-1 following sexual contact can not be explained solely on the expression of chemokine co-receptors by T lymphocyte subsets . Molecular genetics of bipolar disorder . Bipolar disorder ( BPD ) is an often devastating illness characterized by extreme mood dysregulation . Although family , twin and adoption studies consistently indicate a strong genetic component , specific genes that contribute to the illness remain unclear . This study gives an overview of linkage studies of BPD , concluding that the regions with the best evidence for linkage include areas on chromosomes 2p , 4p , 4q , 6q , 8q , 11p , 12q , 13q , 16p , 16q , 18p , 18q , 21q , 22q and Xq . Association studies are summarized , which support a possible role for numerous candidate genes in BPD including P21964 , Q01959 , Q13639 , P21917 , P14416 , P28223 , 5-HTT , the P59103 /G30 complex , Q9NRI5 , Q99572 , P21397 and P23560 . Animal models related to bipolar illness are also reviewed , with special attention paid to those with clear genetic implications . We conclude with suggestions for strategies that may help clarify the genetic bases of this complex illness . Estrogenic chemicals at puberty change ERalpha in the hypothalamus of male and female rats . The effects of two environmental endocrine disruptors , the synthetic pharmaceutical estrogen DB00977 ( EE ) and bisphenol-A ( Q03001 ) , were analysed in male and female rats in a very sensitive developmental period , puberty . Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate changes in the number of cells expressing estrogen receptors ( P03372 ) in the arcuate nucleus ( ARC ) , ventromedial nucleus ( VMH ) and medial preoptic area ( DB00603 ) of the hypothalamus . Animals were treated during early puberty , from P01160 23 to P01160 30 , with EE and Q03001 given orally every day . They were then sacrificed and perfused on P01160 37 or P01160 90 , and blood and brains were collected for hormonal determination ( testosterone and estradiol ) and immunohistochemistry ( estrogen receptors , ER ) . At P01160 37 , ER-labelled neurons were higher in males than in females in the ARC and DB00603 . EE and Q03001 increased ER-labelled neurons in the ARC and DB00603 . At P01160 90 , females showed higher ER-labelled neurons in the VMH . EE and Q03001 increased ER-labelled neurons in the DB00603 in females . EE increased testosterone in males at P01160 37 and estradiol in females at P01160 90 . These results indicate the ability of estrogenic chemicals to change the reproductive neural circuits during puberty in male and female rats . Analysis of neurogenic contractions induced by ML-1035 and other benzamides in the guinea-pig non-stimulated isolated ileum . 4-Amino-5-chloro-substituted benzamides have been shown to increase gastric motility in-vivo and enhance field-stimulated and peristaltic contractions in-vitro . The present experiments examined the contractile response to a series of benzamides in the guinea-pig non-stimulated ileum . Four benzamides elicited contractions in the isolated ileum which were expressed as a percentage of the contraction induced by 1 microM acetylcholine ( % acetylcholine response = 12 +/- 2 , 19 +/- 3 , 26 +/- 2 , 51 +/- 3 , n = 13 , 8 , 17 , and 21 , with EC50 values of 0.85 , 1.8 , 5.7 , and 14.2 microM for cisapride , zacopride , metoclopramide , and ML-1035 ( 4-amino-5-chloro-2-((2-methylsulphinyl)-ethoxy)-N- ( 2-(diethylamino)-ethyl ) -benzamide hydrochloride ) , respectively ) . ML-1035 contractions were completely blocked by atropine and tetrodotoxin , while ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium was ineffective . DB01233 has been reported to sensitize postjunctional muscarinic receptors , however , ML-1035 did not enhance acetylcholine-induced contractions . Tropisetron ( ICS 205-930 , 1 microM ) , caused a parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for both ML-1035 and zacopride ( EC50 = 14.2 +/- 1.3 and 1.8 +/- 0.8 microM in the absence , and 26 +/- 2.7 and 6.9 +/- 2.3 microM in the presence of tropisetron for ML-1035 and zacopride , respectively ) with apparent pKB values of 5.9 and 6.0 for the respective compounds . 5-Hydroxytryptaminergic receptor desensitization by 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5- Q9H205 ) and 5-methoxytryptamine ( Q13639 ) , attenuated the response to ML-1035. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Dopamine agonists upregulate P05231 and P10145 production in human keratinocytes . AIM : Catecholamines regulate functions of the nervous , neuroendocrine and immune systems . Dopamine may modulate the activity of keratinocytes , which play a role in secreting cytokines and chemokines . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dopaminergic agonists on the production of P05231 and P10145 by a non-tumoral human keratinocyte cell line ( HaCaT ) . METHODS : Cells were stimulated with dopamine and the P14416 agonist cabergoline . Levels of P05231 and P10145 in culture supernatants were then determined . Cell proliferation was also assessed . Assays were carried out in the presence or absence of the dopaminergic and β-adrenergic receptor antagonists ( sulpiride and propranolol , respectively ) and ascorbic acid . RESULTS : Dopamine stimulated the production of P05231 and P10145 in a concentration-dependent manner . The effects observed on the secretion of P05231 were more potent than those corresponding to P10145 and were reduced by ascorbic acid . The dopamine-induced P05231 secretion was partially reduced by sulpiride and abrogated by propranolol . The latter drug was able to block the effect of dopamine on the secretion of P10145 . The cabergoline-induced P05231 release was reduced by sulpiride . Cell viability was not affected by any of the drugs . CONCLUSIONS : Dopaminergic agonists can stimulate keratinocytes to produce P05231 and P10145 which are related to inflammatory cutaneous processes . These effects are mediated by dopaminergic and β-adrenergic receptors and by receptor-independent oxidative mechanisms . Effect of metoclopramide , ondansetron and granisetron on aldosterone secretion in man . The plasma aldosterone response following the administration of drugs with antagonist and agonist activity at Serotonin 3 and 4 ( 5- Q9H205 & 4 ) receptors has been examined in 9 healthy male volunteers receiving the following four treatments i.v. in a randomised , cross-over sequence : ondansetron 8 mg , granisetron 3 mg , metoclopramide 20 mg , and saline 20 ml . DB01233 significantly increased the mean plasma aldosterone level to 196 % of basal level at 5 min . It rose to 234 % at 15 min and remained at more than 185 % of basal level for the duration of the experiment . The response to ondansetron and granisetron did not differ significantly from placebo . If dopamine antagonism is discounted , the results suggest that metoclopramide-induced aldosterone secretion results from its agonist activity at Q13639 receptors , although slow neuronal depolarization via an unidentified receptor remains a possibility . Antagonism at the 5- Q9H205 receptor plays no role , as the selective antagonist , granisetron , did not elicit a significant response . It seems unlikely that the Q13639 receptor is the second , low affinity binding site of ondansetron , unless it had no agonist activity at this receptor . Characterization of plant P18887 and its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen . In plants , there are no P06746 ( Pol beta ) and P49916 ( Lig3 ) genes . Thus , the plant short-patch base excision repair ( short-patch BER ) pathway must differ considerably from that in mammals . We characterized the rice ( Oryza Sativa L. cv. Nipponbare ) homologue of the mammalian X-ray repair cross complementing 1 ( P18887 ) , a well-known BER protein . The plant P18887 lacks the N-terminal domain ( NTD ) which is required for Pol beta binding and is essential for mammalian cell survival . The recombinant rice P18887 ( OsXRCC1 ) protein binds single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) as well as double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) and also interacts with rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( OsPCNA ) in a pull-down assay . Through immunoprecipitation , we demonstrated that OsXRCC1 forms a complex with P12004 in vivo . OsXRCC1 mRNA was expressed in all rice organs and was induced by application of bleomycin , but not of MMS , H(2)O(2) or UV-B . DB00290 also increased the fraction of OsXRCC1 associated with chromatin . These results suggest that OsXRCC1 contributes to DNA repair pathways that differ from the mammalian BER system . The P38936 codon 31*C- and P14416 codon 313*T-related genotypes/alleles , but not P18887 codon 399 , hOGG1 codon 326 , and P21728 -48 polymorphisms , are correlated with the presence of leiomyoma . OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether the gene polymorphisms for P38936 , X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 ( P18887 ) , human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 ( hOGG1 ) , and dopamine D1 and D2 receptors ( P21728 , -2 ) are associated with leiomyoma susceptibility . DESIGN : Prospective study . SETTING : Departments of gynecology and genetics in a medical center . PATIENT(S) : Women were divided into two groups : leiomyoma ( n = 120 ) and nonleiomyoma ( n = 112 ) . INTERVENTION(S) : The P38936 codon 31 , P18887 codon 399 , hOGG1 codon 326 , P21728 -48 , and P14416 codon 313 polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction with restriction enzyme digestions ( Blp I , MspI , Fnu4HI , Dde I , and NcoI , respectively ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Genotypes and allelic frequencies . RESULT(S) : The P38936 codon 31(*)C- and P14416 codon 313(*)T-related genotypes/alleles were associated with the presence of leiomyomas . The proportions of P38936 (*)CC/CA/AA and P14416 (*)CC/CT/TT in both groups were 27.5/68.3/4.2 % and 12.5/51.7/35.8 % ( leiomyoma ) ; and 14.3/51.8/33.9 % and 33.9/40.2/25.9 % ( nonleiomyoma ) . P18887 , hOGG1 , and P21728 were not correlated with the presence of leiomyomas . P18887 (*)GG/GA/AA , hOGG1(*)TT/TA/AA , and P21728 (*)GG/GA/AA were 54.2/37.5/8.3 % , 36.7/44.2/19.1 % , and 3.3/25.8/70.8 % ( leiomyoma ) ; and 48.2/47.3/4.5 % , 43.6/41/15.4 % , and 3.6/25/71.4 % ( nonleiomyoma ) . CONCLUSION(S) : The P38936 codon 31(*)C- and P14416 codon 313(*)T-related genotypes/alleles were associated with the presence of leiomyoma . P18887 , hOGG1 , and P21728 were not correlated with leiomyoma development . Enhanced incentive motivation for sucrose-paired cues in adolescent rats : possible roles for dopamine and opioid systems . Vulnerability to the effects of drugs of abuse during adolescence may be related to altered incentive motivation , a process believed to be important in addiction . Incentive motivation can be seen when a neutral stimulus acquires motivational properties through repeated association with a primary reinforcer . We compared adolescent ( postnatal day ( P01160 ) 24-50 ) and adult ( > P01160 70 ) rats on a measure of incentive motivation : responding for a conditioned reinforcer ( CR ) . Rats learned to associate the delivery of 0.1 ml of 10 % sucrose with a conditioned stimulus ( CS ; light and tone ) ; 30 pairings per day were given over 14 days . Then , we measured responding on a lever delivering the CS ( now a CR ) after injections of amphetamine ( 0 , 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg ) . We also examined responding for CR when the CS and sucrose were paired or unpaired during conditioning , and responding for the primary reinforcer ( 10 % sucrose ) in control experiments . Finally , we examined the effects of D(1) and P14416 antagonists ( P35240 39166 and eticlopride , respectively ) and an opioid receptor antagonist ( naltrexone ) on responding for a CR in adolescent rats . Adolescents but not adults acquired responding for a CR , but adolescents responded less than adults for the primary reinforcer . Responding for a CR depended upon the pairing of the CS and sucrose during conditioning . Both dopamine and opioid receptor antagonists reduced responding for the CR . Therefore , incentive motivation may be enhanced in adolescents compared with adults , and incentive motivation may be mediated in part by both dopamine and opioid systems . DB08827 . Aegerion Pharmaceuticals is developing lomitapide , a small-molecule , microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) inhibitor , for the treatment of both familial and primary hypercholesterolemia . Oral , once-daily lomitapide will be targeted at patients resistant to P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) either due to abnormalities in liver function or to discontinuation because of muscle pain . An oral formulation of lomitapide is in phase III development for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa ) in the US , Canada , Italy , and South Africa . This review discusses the key development milestones and therapeutic trials of this drug . Investigation of Q13639 receptors in bronchial hyperresponsiveness in cigarette smoke-exposed mice . BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) arises from an interaction between genetic host factors and environmental exposures ( mainly cigarette smoke ( CS ) ) . Genome Wide Association studies have demonstrated that genetic variations in the gene encoding 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptors ( 5-HT(4)R ) , Q13639 , were associated with measures of airway obstruction and with P48444 . We hypothesised that 5-HT(4) receptors , in addition to 5-HT2AR and muscarinic receptors , contribute to the pathogenesis of P48444 by facilitating cholinergic bronchoconstriction . METHODS : The levels of pulmonary 5-HT(4)R mRNA were measured in CS-exposed mice by qRT-PCR . We investigated the effect of CS exposure on bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) to 5-HT and evaluated the contribution of 5-HT2AR , muscarinic receptors and 5-HT(4)R in the response to 5-HT by using the corresponding antagonists and 5-HT(4)R knockout ( KO ) mice . RESULTS : The 5-HT(4)R mRNA levels were significantly elevated upon acute ( 3 days ) , subacute ( 4 weeks ) and chronic ( 24 weeks ) CS exposure . Both acute and subacute CS exposure significantly increased BHR to 5-HT . Antagonism of 5-HT2AR abolished the CS-induced BHR to 5-HT , and antagonism of muscarinic receptors significantly reduced the response to 5-HT . However , pre-treatment with GR113808 , a specific 5-HT(4)R antagonist , did not alter the response to 5-HT in CS-exposed mice . Accordingly , the CS-induced BHR to 5-HT was not different between wild-type and 5-HT(4)R KO mice . CONCLUSION : CS increased the levels of 5-HT(4)R mRNA in the lungs , concomitantly with bronchial responsiveness to 5-HT . Our in vivo data using pharmacologic and genetic approaches suggest that 5-HT(4) receptors are not involved in the BHR to 5-HT in CS-exposed mice . Microsomal transfer protein ( P55157 ) inhibition-a novel approach to the treatment of homozygous hypercholesterolemia . Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) represents the most severe lipoprotein disorder , generally attributable to mutation(s) of the low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDL-R ) , i.e. autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia type 1 ( P07327 ) . Much lower percentages are due to alterations of apolipoprotein B ( P00325 ) , or gain-of-function mutations of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) ( P00326 ) . In certain geographical areas a significant number of patients may be affected by an autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia ( Q5SW96 ) . Mutations may be also combined ( two mutations of the same gene , compound heterozygosity ) , or two in different genes ( double heterozygosity ) . Among the most innovative therapeutic approaches made available recently , inhibitors of the microsomal transfer protein ( P55157 ) system have shown a high clinical potential . P55157 plays a critical role in the assembly/secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins ( VLDL ) , and its absence leads to apo B deficiency . P55157 antagonists dramatically lower LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) in animals , although a reported increase of liver fat delayed their clinical development . DB08827 , the best-studied P55157 inhibitor , reduces LDL-C by 50 % or more in HoFH patients , with modest , reversible , liver steatosis . Recent US approval has confirmed an acceptable tolerability , provided patients adhere to a strictly low-fat regimen . There are no clinical data on atherosclerosis reduction/regression , but animal models provide encouraging results . Effects of the total saponins from Rosa laevigata Michx fruit against acetaminophen-induced liver damage in mice via induction of autophagy and suppression of inflammation and apoptosis . The effect of the total saponins from Rosa laevigata Michx fruit ( RLTS ) against acetaminophen ( DB00316 ) -induced liver damage in mice was evaluated in the present paper . The results showed that RLTS markedly improved the levels of liver SOD , CAT , DB00143 , DB00143 -Px , MDA , NO and P35228 , and the activities of serum ALT and Q9NRA2 caused by DB00316 . Further research confirmed that RLTS prevented fragmentation of DNA and mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations based on TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) assays . In addition , RLTS decreased the gene or protein expressions of cytochrome P450 ( P05181 ) , pro-inflammatory mediators ( IL-1β , P05112 , P05231 , P01375 -α , P35228 , Bax , HMGB-1 and P35354 ) , pro-inflammatory transcription factors ( NF-κB and AP-1 ) , pro-apoptotic proteins ( cytochrome C , p53 , caspase-3 , caspase-9 , p-JNK , p-p38 and p- P29323 ) , and increased the protein expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL . Moreover , the gene expression of P22301 , and the proteins including LC3 , Q14457 and Atg5 induced by DB00316 were even more augmented by the extract . These results demonstrate that RLTS has hepatoprotective effects through antioxidative action , induction of autophagy , and suppression of inflammation and apoptosis , and could be developed as a potential candidate to treat DB00316 -induced liver damage in the future . DB01233 stimulates catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide secretion from pheochromocytoma cells through activation of serotonin type 4 ( Q13639 ) receptors . The gastroprokinetic agent metoclopramide is known to stimulate catecholamine secretion from pheochromocytomas . The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanism of action of metoclopramide and expression of serotonin type 4 ( 5-HT(4) ) receptors in pheochromocytoma tissues . Tissue explants , obtained from 18 pheochromocytomas including the tumor removed from a 46-year-old female patient who experienced life-threatening hypertension crisis after metoclopramide administration and 17 additional pheochromocytomas ( 9 benign and 8 malignant ) were studied . Cultured pheochromocytoma cells derived from the patient who previously received metoclopramide were incubated with metoclopramide and various 5-HT(4) receptor ligands . In addition , total mRNAs were extracted from all the 18 tumors . Catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide concentrations were measured in pheochromocytoma cell incubation medium by HPLC and radioimmunological assays . In addition , expression of 5-HT(4) receptor mRNAs in the 18 pheochromocytomas was investigated by the use of reverse transcriptase-PCR . RESULTS : DB01233 and the 5-HT(4) receptor agonist cisapride were found to activate catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide secretions by cultured tumor cells . DB01233 - and cisapride-evoked catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide productions were inhibited by the 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist GR 113808 . 5-HT(4) receptor mRNAs were detected in the patient 's tumor and the series of 17 additional pheochromocytomas . This study shows that pheochromocytomas express functional 5-HT(4) receptors that are responsible for the stimulatory action of metoclopramide on catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide secretion . All 5-HT(4) receptor agonists must therefore be contraindicated in patients with proven or suspected pheochromocytoma . Effects of metoclopramide and tropisetron on aldosterone secretion possibly due to agonism and antagonism at the Q13639 receptor . OBJECTIVE : Part of the prokinetic activity of metoclopramide can possibly be ascribed to agonist activity at Q13639 receptors . The 5- Q9H205 antagonist tropisetron is thought to act as an antagonist at Q13639 receptors . In the present study aldosterone secretion in response to the administration of these two drugs was explored to examine the role of the Q13639 receptor in aldosterone secretion . METHODS : Following a single-blind , random design , ten normal male volunteers received one of the following regimens on three occasions , with at least 2-week intervals : metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. ; tropisetron 5 mg by slow i.v.i. , or ; tropisetron by slow i.v.i. , followed by 10 mg metoclopramide i.v. RESULTS : In response to metoclopramide alone the mean plasma aldosterone level rose significantly to 149 % of basal level and remained significantly elevated for the next 20 min . With tropisetron alone , there was a significant 37.8 % drop at 60 min and the aldosterone levels remained low for the duration of the experiment . DB01233 reversed the decline mediated by tropisetron significantly at 30 and 90 min . DB04630 levels after the latter regimen also did not differ significantly from baseline at any time period . CONCLUSION : These results would suggest the existence of a tonic stimulatory influence of 5-HT via Q13639 receptors on aldosterone secretion , which could be augmented by metoclopramide and blocked by tropisetron . However , the effect of tropisetron per se should be interpreted with caution given the lack of a saline group . Efficacy and safety of repeated dosing of netupitant , a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist , in treating overactive bladder . AIM : NK-1 receptors in sensory nerves , the spinal cord and bladder smooth muscle participate in complex sensory mechanisms that regulate bladder activity . This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a new P25103 antagonist , netupitant , in patients with OAB . METHODS : This was a phase II , multicenter , double-blind study in which adults with OAB symptoms > 6 months were randomized to receive 1 of 3 doses of netupitant ( 50 , 100 , 200 mg ) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks . The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in average number of daily micturitions at week 8 . Urinary incontinence , urge urinary incontinence ( UUI ) , and urgency episodes were also assessed . RESULTS : The primary efficacy endpoint was similar in the treatment groups ( -13.85 for placebo to -16.17 in the netupitant 200 mg group ) with no statistically significant differences between netupitant and placebo . The same was true for most secondary endpoints although a significant difference for improvement in UUI episodes and a trend for the greatest decrease in urgency episodes were seen in the netupitant 100 mg group . DB09048 was well tolerated with most treatment emergent adverse events ( AEs ) being mild . While the overall incidence of AEs increased with netupitant dose , there was no evidence for this dose dependency based on relationship to treatment , intensity , or time to onset . CONCLUSIONS : The study failed to demonstrate superiority of netupitant versus placebo in decreasing OAB symptoms , despite a trend favoring netupitant 100 mg . There were no safety concerns with daily administration of netupitant over 8 weeks . [ Role of neurokinin-1 receptor in lung injury in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis ] . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the expression of neurokinin-1 receptor ( P25103 ) in the lung tissue , and the relationship between expression of P25103 and lung injury in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis ( P01160 ) . METHODS : One hundred and twenty adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into P01160 and control groups . Animals in group P01160 were induced by the retrograde intraductal infusion of 5 % sodium taurocholate ( 0.1 ml/kg ) , and animals in normal control group received laparotomy only . The accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in lung tissues was measured with myeloperoxidase ( P05164 ) assay . Lung endothelial barrier destruction was measured by lung capillary permeability ( LCP ) . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) was used to determine the mRNA expression of P25103 , western blot analysis was used to determine P25103 protein expression levels , and immunohistochemistry was used to localize expression site of P25103 . RESULTS : P25103 mRNA level was enhanced in the lung of P01160 compared with normal control group . Western blot analysis showed overexpression of P25103 protein level exited in P01160 group . Statistical analysis revealed correlation between P25103 mRNA and P05164 ( r=0.83 , P < 0.01 ) and LCP ( r=0.79 , P < 0.01 ) respectively . With immunohistochemistry staining , moderate to strong P25103 immunoreactivity was localized to alveolar membrane , I epithelium , II epithelium and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the lung of P01160 . CONCLUSION : In P01160 , overexpression of P25103 contributes to disturbance of neuropeptides loop , resulting in aggregation of neutrophilic granulocyte and promoting deterioration of lung injury . Effects of enhancement and antagonism of 5-hydroxytryptamine activity on the influence of metoclopramide on gastric emptying . This study examines the influence of the serotonergic system on the effect of metoclopramide on gastric emptying . Six subjects received the following pretreatments before metoclopramide and paracetamol : fluoxetine ( 5-HT uptake inhibitor ) ; meterogoline ( 5-HT1 antagonist ) ; pizotifen ( 5-HT2 antagonist ) or methysergide ( 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist ) . One regimen consisted of metoclopramide ( 5- Q9H205 antagonist and Q13639 agonist ) alone . Gastric emptying was measured by the mean cumulative fraction absorbed-time profiles of paracetamol . Methysergide/metoclopramide significantly delayed gastric emptying from 30 min onwards . DB01233 with either metergoline or pizotifen did not retard gastric emptying to the same extent , suggesting a greater influence with simultaneous 5-HT1 and 5HT2 blockade . DB01233 /fluoxetine caused a significant decrease in the fractional absorption of paracetamol at 5 min when compared to the metoclopramide regimen . It was assumed that the influence of metoclopramide was not optimal at this stage , therefore possibly indicating domination of 5- Q9H205 over Q13639 effects , resulting in gastric delay . It therefore seems as if all the 5-HT receptors present in the gut have a role to play in the control of gastric emptying . Q9NQ38 and P07550 haplotypes are risk factors for asthma in Mexican pediatric patients . BACKGROUND : Asthma is one of the most common respiratory diseases worldwide , and the complexity of its etiology has been widely documented . Chromosome 5q31-33 is one of the main loci implicated in asthma and asthma-related traits . P35225 , P08571 and P07550 , which are located in this risk locus , are among the genes most strongly associated with asthma susceptibility . OBJECTIVES : This study evaluated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms or haplotypes at 5q31-33 conferred risk for asthma in Mexican-Mestizo pediatric patients . METHODS : We performed a case-controlled study including 851 individuals , 421 of them affected with childhood-onset asthma and 430 ethnically matched unaffected subjects . We used the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay to genotype 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms within P05113 , Q92878 , P35225 , P05112 , P08571 , Q9NQ38 , Q13639 , P07550 and P29460 . RESULTS : Although no association was detected for any risk allele , three Q9NQ38 haplotypes ( O75223 : p = 6 × 10(-6) ; AATC : p = 0.0001 ; AGTT : p = 0.0001 ) and five P07550 haplotypes ( AGGACC : p = 0.0014 ; AGGAAG : p = 0.0002 ; TGAGAG : p = 0.0001 ; AGGAAC : p = 0.0002 ; AAGGAG : p = 0.003 ) were associated with asthma . Notably , the AGTT Q9NQ38 haplotype exhibited a male gender-dependent association ( p = 7.6 × 10(-5) ) . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that Q9NQ38 and P07550 haplotypes might play a role in the susceptibility to childhood-onset asthma . DB01233 does not increase gastric muscle contractility in newborn rats . Feeding intolerance resulting from delayed gastric emptying is common in premature neonates . DB01233 ( MCP ) , the most frequently used prokinetic drug in neonates , enhances gastric muscle contractility through inhibition of dopamine receptors . Although its therapeutic benefit is established in adults , limited data are available to support its clinical use in infants . Hypothesizing that developmentally dependent differences are present , we comparatively evaluated the effect of MCP on fundus muscle contractility in newborn , juvenile , and adult rats . The muscle strips were either contracted with electrical field stimulation ( O43281 ) to induce cholinergic nerve-mediated acetylcholine release or carbachol , a cholinergic agonist acting directly on the muscarinic receptor . Although in adult rats MCP increased O43281 -induced contraction by 294 ± 122 % of control ( P < 0.01 ) , no significant effect was observed in newborn fundic muscle . MCP had no effect on the magnitude of the carbachol-induced and/or bethanechol-induced gastric muscle contraction at any age . In response to dopamine , an 80.7 ± 5.3 % relaxation of adult fundic muscle was observed , compared with only a 8.4 ± 8.7 % response in newborn tissue ( P < 0.01 ) . P14416 expression was scant in neonates and significantly increased in adult gastric tissue ( P < 0.01 ) . In conclusion , the lack of MCP effect on the newborn fundic muscle contraction potential relates to developmental differences in dopamine D2 receptor expression . To the extent that these novel data can be extrapolated to neonates , the therapeutic value of MCP as a prokinetic agent early in life requires further evaluation . Chronic atrial fibrillation alters the functional properties of If in the human atrium . INTRODUCTION : Despite the evidence that the hyperpolarization-activated current ( If ) is highly modulated in human cardiomyopathies , no definite data exist in chronic atrial fibrillation ( cAF ) . We investigated the expression , function , and modulation of If in human cAF . METHODS AND RESULTS : Right atrial samples were obtained from sinus rhythm ( SR , n = 49 ) or cAF ( duration > 1 year , n = 31 ) patients undergoing corrective cardiac surgery . Among f-channel isoforms expressed in the human atrium ( O60741 , 2 and 4 ) , Q9Y3Q4 mRNA levels measured by RT-PCR were significantly reduced . However , protein expression was preserved in cAF compared to SR ( +85 % for Q9Y3Q4 ) ; concurrently , miR-1 expression was significantly reduced . In patch-clamped atrial myocytes , current-specific conductance ( gf ) was significantly increased in cAF at voltages around the threshold for If activation ( -60 to -80 mV ) ; accordingly , a 10-mV rightward shift of the activation curve occurred ( P < 0.01 ) . β-Adrenergic and Q13639 receptor stimulation exerted similar effects on If in cAF and SR cells , while the P01160 -mediated effect was significantly reduced ( P < 0.02 ) , suggesting downregulation of natriuretic peptide signaling . CONCLUSIONS : In human cAF modifications in transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms of HCN channels occur , associated with a slight yet significant gain-of-function of If , which may contribute to enhanced atrial ectopy . Clinical and genetic factors associated with nausea and vomiting in cancer patients receiving opioids . BACKGROUND : This study investigates whether demographical , disease-related and genetic factors contribute to inter-individual differences in nausea and vomiting among patients receiving opioids for cancer pain . METHODS : Cancer patients receiving opioids were included from 17 centres in 11 European countries . Intensities of nausea and vomiting were reported by 1579 patients on four-point categorical scales . In stratified regression models including demographical and disease-related factors as covariates , 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 16 candidate genes related to opioid- or nausea/vomiting signalling pathways ( P08183 , P35372 , P41145 , P32121 , P42226 , P21964 , P20309 , P08912 , P35367 , P14416 , P35462 , P25103 , P46098 , O95264 , Q8WXA8 , P21554 ) were analysed for association with nausea and vomiting . FINDINGS : Age , body mass index , Karnofsky Performance Status , gender , use of antiemetics , type of opioid , type of cancer and eight SNPs were associated with the inter-individual differences in nausea and vomiting among cancer patients treated with opioids ( p < 0.01 ) . The SNPs were rs1176744 , rs3782025 and rs1672717 in O95264 ; rs165722 , rs4680 and rs4633 in P21964 ; rs10802789 and rs685550 in P20309 . Only the SNP rs1672717 in O95264 passed the Benjamini-Hochberg criterion for a 10 % false discovery rate . INTERPRETATION : Clinical characteristics and SNPs within the O95264 , P21964 and P20309 genes may be associated with the variability in nausea and vomiting among cancer patients receiving opioids . This knowledge may help to identify patients at particular risk for nausea and vomiting during treatment with opioids for cancer pain . Dual P00533 and P42345 targeting in squamous cell carcinoma models , and development of early markers of efficacy . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is a validated target in squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the head and neck . Most patients , however , do not respond or develop resistance to this agent . P42345 ( P42345 ) is involved in the pathogenesis of SCC of the head and neck ( SCCHN ) . This study aimed to determine if targeting P42345 in combination with P00533 is effective in SCC , and to develop early pharmacodynamic markers of efficacy . Two SCC cell lines , one resistant ( HEP2 ) and one of intermediate susceptibility ( Detroit 562 ) to P00533 inhibitors , were xenografted in vivo and treated with an P42345 inhibitor ( temsirolimus ) , an P00533 inhibitor ( erlotinib ) or a combination of both . DB06287 exerted superior growth arrest in both cell lines than erlotinib . The combined treatment resulted in synergistic antitumor effects in the Detroit 562 cell line . Immunohistochemical assessment of pharmacodynamic effects in fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsies early after treatment using phospho MAPK , Phospho-P70 and Ki67 as end points demonstrated pathway abrogation in the Detroit 562 tumours treated with the combination , the only group where regressions were seen . In conclusion , an P42345 inhibitor showed antitumor activity in P00533 -resistant SCC cell lines . Marked antitumor effects were associated with dual pathway inhibition , which were detected by early FNA biopsies . Oral keratinocytes support non-replicative infection and transfer of harbored HIV-1 to permissive cells . BACKGROUND : Oral keratinocytes on the mucosal surface are frequently exposed to HIV-1 through contact with infected sexual partners or nursing mothers . To determine the plausibility that oral keratinocytes are primary targets of HIV-1 , we tested the hypothesis that HIV-1 infects oral keratinocytes in a restricted manner . RESULTS : To study the fate of HIV-1 , immortalized oral keratinocytes ( OKF6/ O14746 -2 ; O14746 -2 cells ) were characterized for the fate of HIV-specific RNA and DNA . At 6 h post inoculation with X4 or R5-tropic HIV-1 , HIV-1gag RNA was detected maximally within O14746 -2 cells . Reverse transcriptase activity in O14746 -2 cells was confirmed by VSV-G-mediated infection with HIV-NL4-3Deltaenv-EGFP . DB00495 inhibited EGFP expression in a dose-dependent manner , suggesting that viral replication can be supported if receptors are bypassed . Within 3 h post inoculation , integrated HIV-1 DNA was detected in O14746 -2 cell nuclei and persisted after subculture . Multiply spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs were not detectable up to 72 h post inoculation , suggesting that HIV replication may abort and that infection is non-productive . Within 48 h post inoculation , however , virus harbored by P01730 negative O14746 -2 cells trans infected co-cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) or MOLT4 cells ( P01730 + P51681 + ) by direct cell-to-cell transfer or by releasing low levels of infectious virions . Primary tonsil epithelial cells also trans infected HIV-1 to permissive cells in a donor-specific manner . CONCLUSION : Oral keratinocytes appear , therefore , to support stable non-replicative integration , while harboring and transmitting infectious X4- or R5-tropic HIV-1 to permissive cells for up to 48 h . Genetics of bipolar disorder . Many linkage loci and candidate genes have been reported in molecular genetic studies of bipolar disorder . However , none of these findings have been consistently replicated . Meta-analyses of linkage studies have also reported conflicting results . Among recently reported candidate genes , P23560 , P59103 , P31749 , Q12879 , P17861 , P35626 , Q13639 , O14732 and P14867 may have some importance . Study of the possible roles of epigenetics or analysis of genetic diseases , in which bipolar disorder is one of phenotypes , may also be promising . In addition to monoaminergic and intracellular signaling pathways , recent studies have revealed possible roles for mitochondrial dysfunction , for glutamatergic dysfunction and for the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway . Identification of novel genetic alterations in samples of malignant glioma patients . Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant human brain tumor . High level of genomic instability detected in glioma cells implies that numerous genetic alterations accumulate during glioma pathogenesis . We investigated alterations in AP-PCR DNA profiles of 30 glioma patients , and detected specific changes in 11 genes not previously associated with this disease : Q86UP9 , Q13326 , Q13639 , P05556 , P31327 , P07225 , P55259 , Q9UJ96 , Q08499 , Q8N743 , and Q14642 . Further correlations revealed that 8 genes might play important role in pathogenesis of glial tumors , while changes in P55259 , Q9UJ96 and Q8N743 should be considered as passenger mutations , consequence of high level of genomic instability . Identified genes have a significant role in signal transduction or cell adhesion , which are important processes for cancer development and progression . According to our results , Q86UP9 might be characteristic of primary glioblastoma , Q13326 , Q13639 , P05556 , P31327 , P07225 and Q14642 were detected predominantly in anaplastic astrocytoma , suggesting their role in progression of secondary glioblastoma , while alterations of Q08499 seem to have important role in development of both glioblastoma subtypes . Some of the identified genes showed significant association with p53 , p16 , and P00533 , but there was no significant correlation between loss of P60484 and any of identified genes . In conclusion our study revealed genetic alterations that were not previously associated with glioma pathogenesis and could be potentially used as molecular markers of different glioblastoma subtypes .
No significant association between genetic variants in 7 candidate genes and response to methylphenidate treatment in adult patients with ADHD . Results from pharmacogenetic investigations of methylphenidate ( DB00422 ) response in patients with ADHD are still inconsistent , especially among adults . This study investigates the role of genetic variants ( P31645 , P28222 , Q8IWU9 , P09172 , P21917 , P21964 , and P60880 ) in the response to DB00422 in a sample of 164 adults . Genes were chosen owing to previous evidence for an influence in ADHD susceptibility . No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between DB00422 responders and nonresponders were detected . In conclusion , our findings do not support an effect of these genes in the pharmacogenetics of DB00422 among adults with ADHD . Rosiglitazone regulates P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in porcine adipocytes . Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , a proinflammatory cytokine , stimulates adipocyte lipolysis and induces insulin resistance in obese and diabetic subjects . However , the effects of the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone on P05231 -stimulated lipolysis and the underlying molecular mechanism are largely unknown . In this study , we demonstrated that rosiglitazone suppressed P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in differentiated porcine adipocytes by inactivation of extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) . Meanwhile , rosiglitazone enhanced the lipolysis response of adipocytes to isoprenaline . In addition , rosiglitazone significantly reversed P05231 -induced down-regulation of several genes such as perilipin A , peroxisome proliferators activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 & gamma ; ) , and fatty acid synthetase , as well as the up-regulation of P05231 mRNA . However , mRNA expression of Q07869 & gamma ; coactivator-1 alpha ( DB01053 -1 & alpha ; ) was enhanced by rosiglitazone in P05231 -stimulated adipocytes . These results indicate that rosiglitazone suppresses P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in porcine adipocytes through multiple molecular mechanisms . Genetics of Alzheimer 's disease . A rapidly evolving field . Genetic factors have a variable impact on Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) , ranging from familial forms that are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion to sporadic AD , where a polygenic component is present . Most genes conferring susceptibility to AD are related to amyloid-beta deposition ( P05067 ; P49768 ; PS2 ; P02649 ; P01034 ; ubiquilin-1 ) , oxidative stress ( NOS2 ; NOS3 ) and inflammatory response ( P01583 ; P01584 ; P05231 ; P01375 ) . Genome-wide analyses , transcriptomics and proteomics approaches have pointed also to proapoptotic genes as increasing AD liability . Depression and psychotic symptoms that occur in a large proportion of AD patients have been associated with monoamine genes coding for metabolic enzymes ( P21964 ) , transporters ( 5-HTTLPR ) and receptors ( P21728 ; P35462 ) . Genetic testing may be useful to confirm the diagnosis of AD in individuals with clinical signs of dementia , while it is generally not recommended as a predictive testing for AD in asymptomatic individuals . Drugs currently in use to treat AD are effective in only 20 % of patients ; their therapeutic effect is predominantly under genetic control ( O43174 gene ; P02649 ) . Environmental factors have been shown to moderate the effects of genes on psychiatric disorders such as depression , schizophrenia and ADHD . The study of gene-environment interactions in AD , that are still poorly understood , is essential to predict disease-risk in asymptomatic individuals . Genomics will provide a dynamic picture of biological processes in AD and new targets for the forthcoming anti-AD drugs . Catalog of 178 variations in the Japanese population among eight human genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . We screened DNAs from 48 Japanese individuals for single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in eight genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) by directly sequencing the entire relevant genomic regions except for repetitive-sequence elements . This approach identified 147 SNPs and 31 insertion/deletion polymorphisms among the eight GPCR genes . On average , we identified one SNP in every 584 nucleotides . Of the 147 SNPs , 69 were identified in P30556 , 12 in P50052 , nine in P35414 , 20 in P37288 , nine in P30518 , 16 in P21728 , six in P08514 , and six in P43119 . Twenty-one SNPs were located in 5' flanking regions , 76 in introns , 32 in exons , and 18 in 3' flanking regions . These variants should contribute to investigations of possible correlations between genotypes and phenotypes as regards susceptibility to disease or responsiveness to drug therapy . Xaliproden ( SR57746A ) induces P08908 receptor-mediated Q96HU1 kinase activation in PC12 cells . Neurotrophic growth factors are involved in cell survival . However , natural growth factors have a very limited therapeutic use because of their short half-life . In the present study , we investigated the mechanism of action of a non-peptidic neurotrophic drug , Xaliproden , a potential molecule for the treatment of motoneuron diseases , since the transduction pathways of this synthetic P08908 agonist are very poorly understood . Xaliproden does not activate the Trk receptor but causes a rapid increase in the activities of the P27361 and P28482 isoforms of Q96HU1 kinase , which then rapidly decrease to the basal level . We demonstrate that isoforms of the P29353 adapter protein are phosphorylated independently of each other and are probably not the source of the Xaliproden-induced Q96HU1 kinases activation . The inhibitor of Ras farnesylation , FPT-1 , and the protein kinase C inhibitors , GF 109203X and chelerythrine , inhibited the Xaliproden-induced Q96HU1 kinase activation , suggesting p21Ras and PKC involvement . Moreover , the observations that the P08908 antagonist , pindobind , and pertussis toxin abolished the Xaliproden-induced P29323 stimulation suggested that Xaliproden activates the Q96HU1 kinase pathways by stimulating the G protein-coupled receptor , P08908 . These results demonstrate clearly that the non-peptidic compound , Xaliproden , exerts its neurotrophic effects through a mechanism of action differing from that of neurotrophins . These findings suggest that this compound does not involve MAPK activation by TrkA receptor stimulation but acts by Q96HU1 kinase pathway by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism involving P08908 receptors , P38936 Ras and MEK-1 and by PKC and Akt pathways . Association testing of panic disorder candidate genes using Q13308 challenge in healthy volunteers . Despite continuing efforts to determine genetic vulnerability to panic disorder ( PD ) , the studies of candidate genes in this disorder have produced inconsistent or negative , results . Laboratory panic induction may have a potential in testing genetic substrate of PD . In this study we aimed to explore the effects of several genetic polymorphisms previously implicated in PD on the susceptibility to cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide ( Q13308 ) challenge in healthy subjects . The study sample consisted of 110 healthy volunteers ( 47 males and 63 females , mean age 22.2 +/- 5.2 ) who participated in Q13308 challenge test . Nine gene-candidates , including 5-HTTLPR , P21397 VNTR , Q8IWU9 rs1386494 , 5- P08908 -1019C-G , 5- P28223 102T-C , CCKR1 246G-A , CCKR2 -215C-A , P21728 -94G-A and P21964 Val158Met , were selected for genotyping based on previous positive findings from genetic association studies in PD . After Q13308 challenge , 39 ( 35.5 % ) subjects experienced a panic attack , while 71 subjects were defined as non-panickers . We detected significant differences for both genotypic and allelic frequencies of 1386494A/G polymorphism in Q8IWU9 gene between panic and non-panic groups with the frequencies of G/G genotype and G allele significantly higher in panickers . None of the other candidate loci were significantly associated with Q13308 -induced panic attacks in healthy subjects . In line with our previous association study in patients with PD , we detected a possible association between Q8IWU9 rs1386494 polymorphism and susceptibility to panic attacks . Other polymorphisms previously associated with PD were unrelated to Q13308 -induced panic attacks , probably due to the differences between complex nature of PD and laboratory panic model . Association of platelet P08514 and P05106 polymorphisms with ex vivo antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy Chinese male subjects . DB08816 ( Q8NDX1 ) is the first reversible Q9H244 receptor antagonist that exhibits rapid antiplatelet effect by indirect inhibition of the P08514 /IIIa complex . Polymorphisms in genes coding P08514 /IIIa , namely P08514 and P05106 , are associated with aspirin resistance and risk for thrombotic diseases . We assessed whether P08514 and P05106 polymorphisms can influence the ex vivo antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in Chinese population . A total of 196 healthy Chinese male individuals were recruited . ADP-induced platelet aggregation was determined using optical aggregometry at baseline and after incubation of the platelet-rich plasma with 15 and 50 μM ticagrelor , respectively . Single nucleotide polymorphisms in P08514 ( rs5911 G > T ) and P05106 ( rs4642 A > G and rs4634 G > A ) were genotyped by sequencing . Q8NDX1 at both concentrations of 15 and 50 μM decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation significantly ( P < 0.05 , respectively ) . As compared to P08514 rs5911 GG homozygotes , individuals with the rs5911 TG genotype showed significantly increased inhibition of platelet aggregation ( IPA ) by both 15 and 50 μM ticagrelor incubation ( P < 0.05 , respectively ) . Neither rs4642 nor rs4634 polymorphism affected ticagrelor-induced IPA . We suggest that the P08514 rs5911 GG genotype is associated with decreased ex vivo antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in healthy Chinese male subjects . DB02546 and bortezomib synergistically cause ubiquitinated protein accumulation in prostate cancer cells . PURPOSE : Protein ubiquitination is a novel strategy used to treat malignancies . We investigated whether the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , Michigan ) and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( LC Laboratories , Woburn , Massachusetts ) would synergistically cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in prostate cancer cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS : LNCaP , PC-3 and DU 145 cells ( ATCC™ ) were treated with vorinostat and/or bortezomib . Cell viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed . In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a murine subcutaneous tumor model using PC-3 cells . The influence of androgen receptor expression on bortezomib efficacy was examined using RNA interference . Changes in the expression of ubiquitinated proteins , cell cycle associated proteins and acetylated histone were evaluated . RESULTS : P10275 expression seemed to decrease bortezomib activity . PC-3 and DU 145 cells were more susceptible to bortezomib than LNCaP cells and the silencing of androgen receptor expression in LNCaP cells enhanced bortezomib activity . DB02546 and bortezomib synergistically induced apoptosis , inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and suppressed tumor growth in a murine xenograft model . The combination decreased cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression , and increased P38936 expression . The combination synergistically caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and histone acetylation . This histone acetylation was a consequence of the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins . CONCLUSIONS : DB02546 and bortezomib inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells synergistically by causing ubiquitinated proteins to accumulate in cells . The current study provides a framework for testing the combination in patients with advanced prostate cancer . Metalloproteinases control brain inflammation induced by pertussis toxin in mice overexpressing the chemokine P13500 in the central nervous system . Inflammatory leukocytes infiltrate the CNS parenchyma in neuroinflammation . This involves cellular migration across various structures associated with the blood-brain barrier : the vascular endothelium , the glia limitans , and the perivascular space between them . Leukocytes accumulate spontaneously in the perivascular space in brains of transgenic ( Tg ) mice that overexpress P13500 under control of a CNS-specific promoter . The Tg mice show no clinical symptoms , even though leukocytes have crossed the endothelial basement membrane . Pertussis toxin ( PTx ) given i.p. induced encephalopathy and weight loss in Tg mice . We used flow cytometry , ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging , and immunofluorescent staining to show that encephalopathy involved leukocyte migration across the glia limitans into the brain parenchyma , identifying this as the critical step in inducing clinical symptoms . Metalloproteinase ( MPs ) enzymes are implicated in leukocyte infiltration in neuroinflammation . Unmanipulated Tg mice had elevated expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -10 , and -12 mRNA in the brain . PTx further induced expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 , metalloproteinase disintegrins-12 , P22894 , and -10 in brains of Tg mice . Levels of the microglial-associated MP P51511 were not affected in control or PTx-treated Tg mice . PTx also up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and P01375 mRNA in Tg CNS . Weight loss and parenchymal infiltration , but not perivascular accumulation , were significantly inhibited by the broad-spectrum MP inhibitor BB-94/ DB03880 . Our finding that MPs mediate PTx-induced parenchymal infiltration to the chemokine-overexpressing CNS has relevance for the pathogenesis of human diseases involving CNS inflammation , such as multiple sclerosis . P06401 level as a predictor of response to megestrol acetate in advanced breast cancer : a retrospective study . DB00351 ( 160 mg/day ) produced a response rate of 44 % in a retrospective series of 39 evaluable patients with advanced breast cancer . The estrogen-receptor ( ER ) level was greater than 10 fmols/mg of protein in 28 patients , and the progesterone-receptor ( PR ) level was greater than 10 fmols/mg of protein in 26 patients . ER and PR levels , age , and disease-free interval were analyzed for their relationship to response . The PR was the single best predictor of response to megestrol acetate ; the addition of ER added 2 % to the predictive accuracy rate of PR alone . Post-synaptic P08908 receptor involvement in yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine , physostigmine and mCPP in rats . DB00714 and mCPP induced yawning associated with penile erections in rats , whereas physostigmine induced only yawns . DB00714 -induced yawning and penile erections were antagonized by low doses of raclopride , whereas physostigmine-induced yawning and mCPP-induced effects were only partly inhibited at high doses of raclopride . DB00747 as well as clozapine antagonized yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine , mCPP and physostigmine . Similarly , the P08908 agonists 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 inhibited yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine , mCPP and physostigmine , and at similar doses induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling . The beta/ P08908 antagonist tertatolol reversed the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections and increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency but not penile erection frequency . Like tertatolol , propranolol increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency , whereas ICI 118551 increased only physostigmine-induced yawning . 8-OH-DPAT- and S 14506-induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling were also significantly antagonized by tertatolol . Finally , p-chlorophenylalanine pretreatment produced about 95 % depletion in 5-HT in hypothalamus , hippocampus , striatum and frontal cortex and modified neither the responses of the inducing drugs nor the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) DB00714 -induced aggressiveness and [3H]citalopram binding after antidepressant treatment in rats . The effects of acute and repeated administration of antidepressive drugs on apomorphine-induced aggressive behavior and [3H]citalopram binding were studied . In acute behavioral experiments with apomorphine pretreated ( 1.0 mg/kg , once daily ) animals , desipramine ( 10 mg/kg ) and clomipramine ( 10 mg/kg ) enhanced , buspirone ( 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg ) completely blocked , but fluoxetine , amitriptyline , imipramine ( 10 mg/kg ) , and citalopram ( 10 and 20 mg/kg ) had no effect on the intensity of aggressive behavior . Repeated concomitant apomorphine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) and citalopram ( 10 mg/kg ) administration reduced the affinity ( Kd ) of the 5-HT transporter binding sites in three brain regions . This finding was confirmed by an additional experiment as the effect of citalopram treatment . Repeated apomorphine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) or apomorphine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) plus desipramine ( 10 mg/kg ) treatment had no unidirectional effect on Kd , the maximal number of apparent binding sties ( Bmax ) was unchanged in all experiments . Our study indicates that the 5-HT reuptake blockade has no major influence on the apomorphine-induced aggressive behavior , but the P08908 receptor subtype may be involved in the mediation of the aggressive behavior in this paradigm . Allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 40 candidate genes for gene-environment studies on cancer : data from population-based Japanese random samples . Knowledge of genetic polymorphisms in gene-environment studies may contribute to more accurate identification of avoidable risks and to developing tailor-made preventative measures . The aim of this study was to describe the allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of select genes , which may be included in future gene-environment studies on cancer in Japan . SNP typing was performed on middle-aged Japanese men randomly selected from the general population in five areas of Japan . We genotyped and calculated allele frequencies of 153 SNPs located on 40 genes : P04798 , Q16678 , P11712 , P33261 , P05181 , P05093 , P11511 , P35869 , P03372 , Q92731 , ERRRG , P06401 , P07099 , P34913 , P37059 , P37058 , P28161 , P21266 , GSTT2 , P09211 , NAT1 , NAT2 , P21964 , P07327 , P00325 , P00326 , P05091 , P35228 , NOS3 , P01583 , P01584 , O15527 , P36639 [ P36639 ] , P14416 , P35462 , P21917 , P31645 , P04150 [ GCCR ] , P42898 , and P15559 . In the present study , the Japanese allele frequencies were verified by using nationwide population samples . Sex steroid receptors , secondary bile acids and colorectal cancer . A possible mechanism of interaction . AIM : The aim of the work was to study in colon-rectum cancer mucosae the binding charateristics , as sex steroid receptors . METHODS : Specific androgen ( AR ) , estrogen ( ER ) and progesterone ( PgR ) receptors were measured in the tissue samples of 35 patients ( 15 males , 20 females ) undergoing colectomy or coloproctectomy for adenocarcinoma . The characteristics of androgen receptor ( AR , DB02901 -R : dihydrotestosterone receptor ) were also investigated using competitive activity of cyproterone acetate , cortisol , aldosterone and steroid-like substances such as deoxycholic and lithocholic acid , present in the milieu of the considered organ . Binding assays and competition tests were conducted using a charcoal dextran method . RESULTS : When present ( 50 % ) , ER and PgR receptors showed very low levels and no difference was noted between cancerous and the surrounding healthy mucosa . AR were found in all samples from both neoplastic and non neoplastic surrounding mucosa , with no significant difference . P10275 however exhibited an altered binding activity in cancer specimens . DB04839 did not displace DB02901 from AR while significant displacing activity was elicited by DB02901 , testosterone , as well as by lithocholic acid , but not by deoxycholic acid . CONCLUSION : In cancerous large bowel mucosa , androgen receptors show altered binding characteristics . The selective binding of lithocholic acid to AR supports the hypothesis that diet-related endoluminal substances may play a role in cancer development model where molecular alterations such as DNA damage or mutation is the 1st event . Influence of P14416 and Q8NFD2 genotypes on apomorphine-induced growth hormone ( GH ) response in alcohol-dependent patients . BACKGROUND : D(2) receptor function can be assessed by growth hormone ( GH ) response to apomorphine . Several association studies between dopamine receptor polymorphisms and results of the apomorphine challenge test with normal and alcohol-dependent subjects yielded inconsistent results . In this pilot study , we tested polymorphisms from the P14416 region for GH response to apomorphine challenge in more detail . METHODS : DB00714 challenge tests measuring GH responses on 5 time points were performed on day 1 of alcohol detoxification in 43 patients with alcohol dependence ; patients were genotyped for 11 polymorphisms including P14416 , Q8NFD2 , P13591 and Q9H892 . RESULTS : Associations ( p < 0.05 ) were found for Q8NFD2 ( rs11604671 , rs1800497 ) and P14416 ( rs6276 , rs1076560 ) , which are located on adjacent chromosomal positions . Consistent with PET studies suggesting a reduced D(2) receptor availability in patients carrying the Q8NFD2 rs1800497 T polymorphism ( formerly known as P14416 TaqI A1 ) we found a reduced GH response to apomorphine in those subjects . CONCLUSION : This has been the first study showing significant associations between apomorphine-induced GH response and SNPs in P14416 and Q8NFD2 in alcohol-dependent patients . In this respect , our preliminary results are in line with other reports which suggested that P14416 and Q8NFD2 polymorphisms influence D(2) receptor availability and signal transduction in the dopaminergic pathways . Small sample size in our study limits the generalizability of our results . PPARgamma activation abolishes LDL-induced proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells via SOD-mediated down-regulation of superoxide . Native LDL would be a mitogenic and chemotactic stimulus of VSMC proliferation and differentiation in the atherosclerotic lesion where endothelial disruption occurred . In previous studies , our group investigated the molecular mechanisms by which LDL induces P10145 production and by which PPARalpha activation abolishes LDL effects in human aortic SMCs ( hAoSMCs ) . Herein is the first report of PPARgamma activation by troglitazone ( TG ) exerting its inhibitory effects on LDL-induced cell proliferation via generation not of H(2)O(2) , but of O2(.-) , and the subsequent activation of Erk1/2 in hAoSMCs . Moreover , in this study TG abolished the LDL-accelerated G(1)-S progression to control levels via down-regulation of active cyclinD1/ P11802 and cyclinE/ P24941 complexes and up-regulation of P38936 (Cip1) expression . TG exerted its anti-proliferative effects through the up-regulation of basal superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) expression . This data suggests that the regulation of O2(.-) is located at the crossroads between LDL signaling and cell proliferation . The P38936 codon 31*C- and P14416 codon 313*T-related genotypes/alleles , but not P18887 codon 399 , hOGG1 codon 326 , and P21728 -48 polymorphisms , are correlated with the presence of leiomyoma . OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether the gene polymorphisms for P38936 , X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 ( P18887 ) , human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 ( hOGG1 ) , and dopamine D1 and D2 receptors ( P21728 , -2 ) are associated with leiomyoma susceptibility . DESIGN : Prospective study . SETTING : Departments of gynecology and genetics in a medical center . PATIENT(S) : Women were divided into two groups : leiomyoma ( n = 120 ) and nonleiomyoma ( n = 112 ) . INTERVENTION(S) : The P38936 codon 31 , P18887 codon 399 , hOGG1 codon 326 , P21728 -48 , and P14416 codon 313 polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction with restriction enzyme digestions ( Blp I , MspI , Fnu4HI , Dde I , and NcoI , respectively ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Genotypes and allelic frequencies . RESULT(S) : The P38936 codon 31(*)C- and P14416 codon 313(*)T-related genotypes/alleles were associated with the presence of leiomyomas . The proportions of P38936 (*)CC/CA/AA and P14416 (*)CC/CT/TT in both groups were 27.5/68.3/4.2 % and 12.5/51.7/35.8 % ( leiomyoma ) ; and 14.3/51.8/33.9 % and 33.9/40.2/25.9 % ( nonleiomyoma ) . P18887 , hOGG1 , and P21728 were not correlated with the presence of leiomyomas . P18887 (*)GG/GA/AA , hOGG1(*)TT/TA/AA , and P21728 (*)GG/GA/AA were 54.2/37.5/8.3 % , 36.7/44.2/19.1 % , and 3.3/25.8/70.8 % ( leiomyoma ) ; and 48.2/47.3/4.5 % , 43.6/41/15.4 % , and 3.6/25/71.4 % ( nonleiomyoma ) . CONCLUSION(S) : The P38936 codon 31(*)C- and P14416 codon 313(*)T-related genotypes/alleles were associated with the presence of leiomyoma . P18887 , hOGG1 , and P21728 were not correlated with leiomyoma development . Expression of cell adhesion molecules and common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen in hepatoblastoma . Hepatoblastoma is an embryonal tumour of the liver , which often contains tissue components with multidirectional differentiation . The occurrence of cell surface antigens in this tumour has not been studied systematically , and we therefore investigated 20 hepatoblastomas for the expression of common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen ( P08473 ) and cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) in their different tissue components . Epithelial tumour cells of fetal differentiation contained P12830 . This protein did not occur in tumour areas with embryonal or mesenchymal differentiation . In contrast , immature embryonal and anaplastic cells expressed P08473 and the hyaluronate receptor ( HCAM , P16070 ) . Both fetal and embryonal areas stained irregularly positive for P05362 , which , in contrast , was not present on anaplastic cells . Immature fibrous tissue did not contain any of these molecules except for P05362 . However , some cells adjacent to , or enclosed in , osteoid were positive for HCAM and P13591 . Like small undifferentiated hepatoblastoma cells , primitive mesenchymal spindle-shaped cells also expressed P08473 , HCAM , and the polysialylated embryonic form of P13591 strongly . This last is not present on other epithelial or mesenchymal tumour cells . Hepatoblastoma cells of varying differentiation express distinct patterns of CAMs and P08473 . Our results give further insight into their histogenesis and cellular interactions and may explain their variable ability for invasive growth and formation of metastases . Gender difference in the activity but not expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in human lung adenocarcinoma cells . The higher frequency of lung adenocarcinoma in women smokers than in men smokers suggests a role for gender-dependent factors in the etiology of lung cancer . We evaluated estrogen receptor ( ER ) alpha and beta expression and activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and normal lung fibroblasts . Q8N1N2 -length ERalpha and ERbeta proteins were expressed in all cell lines with higher ERbeta than ERalpha . Although estradiol ( E(2) ) binding was similar , E(2) stimulated proliferation only in cells from females , and this response was inhibited by anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( DB04468 ) and DB00947 . In contrast , E(2) did not stimulate replication of lung adenocarcinoma cells from males and DB04468 or ICI did not block cell proliferation . Similarly , transcription of an estrogen response element-driven reporter gene was stimulated by E(2) in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females , but not males . P06401 ( PR ) expression was increased by E(2) in two out of five adenocarcinoma cell lines from females , but none from males . E(2) decreased P12830 protein expression in some of the cell lines from females , as it did in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , but not in the cell lines from males . Thus , ERalpha and ERbeta expression does not correlate with the effect of ER ligands on cellular activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells . On the other hand , coactivator Q15648 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females versus males and higher in adenocarcinoma cells than in normal human bronchial epithelial cells . Q15648 and other ER coregulators may contribute to differences in estrogen responsiveness between lung adenocarcinoma cells in females and males . Comparison of effects of a range of 5-HT receptor modulators on consumption and preference for a sweetened ethanol solution in rats . This study assessed the effects of a range of serotonergic agents on preference for a slightly sweetened ethanol solution ( 10 % ethanol , 3 % glucose ) in rats . A two-bottle , free-choice paradigm was used following induction of ethanol consumption . The model used provides a robust and reliable level of ethanol self-administration in normal laboratory rats . DB00898 consumption was significantly and selectively reduced by the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A ( P08908 ) full agonist 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.3-1.0 mg/kg ) and the 5- Q9H205 antagonist granisetron ( 0.1-1.0 mg/kg ) . Non-specific reductions in fluid consumption were induced by the P28222 agonist RU 24969 ( 0.1-1.0mg/kg ) and the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin ( 1.0-6.0 mg/kg ) . These studies thus confirm the potential for decreasing ethanol consumption and ethanol preference of P08908 agonists and 5- Q9H205 antagonists , but failed to find any selective effects for agents acting at P28222 or 5-HT2 receptors . Is phentermine an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase ? A critical appraisal . DB00191 produces a spectrum of concentration-dependent biochemical effects . It interacts with NE transporters at 0.1 microM , DA transporters at about 1 microM , 5-HT transporters at 15 microM and P21397 at about 100 microM . When administered at typical anorectic doses , phentermine primarily interacts with DA and NE transporters and does not produce biochemical or neurochemical effects which would occur if it were inhibiting P21397 . Some other explanation other than MAO inhibition must be sought to explain how oral phentermine increases platelet 5-HT , since platelet P27338 does not metabolize platelet 5-HT , and since amphetamine-type drugs are even weaker inhibitors of P27338 than P21397 . Clinical studies in humans have shown that amphetamine , which is a more potent inhibitor of P21397 than phentermine , does not inhibit P21397 at therapeutic doses . Neither phentermine alone , fluoxetine alone or their combined use have been associated with cardiac valvulopathy , and clinical experience has shown their combined use to be free of significant adverse effects . Viewed collectively , there appears to be no data to support the hypothesis that phentermine inhibits MAO at typical therapeutic doses . Determination of fenofibric acid concentrations by HPLC after anion exchange solid-phase extraction from human serum . Triglycerides are increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease . Research efforts to identify sources of variability in triglyceride-lowering response to the lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate require quantification of the active acidic form of this Q07869 agonist . Anion-exchange solid-phase extraction , in combination with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) , rapidly and accurately determines steady-state fenofibric acid serum concentrations . Chromatographic separation under isocratic conditions , with use of ultraviolet detection at 285 nm , provides clean baseline and sharp peaks for clofibric acid , 1-napthyl acetic acid ( internal standards ) , and fenofibric acid . Commonly prescribed and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) were screened for assay interference , and the assay was employed to quantify fenofibric acid in more than 800 human subject specimens . DB01039 analysis was found to be linear over the range of 0.5 to 40 mg/L and was validated with either internal standard . Accuracies ranged from 98.65 % to 102.4 % , whereas the within- and between-day precisions ranged from 1.0 % to 2.2 % and 2.0 % to 6.2 % , respectively . NSAIDs had minimal interference with the assay , which succeeded in quantifying fenofibric acid in more than 843 of 846 serum samples from human subjects , many taking a variety of coadministered medications . Anion-exchange solid-phase extraction in combination with reverse-phase HPLC accurately determines steady-state fenofibric acid serum concentrations in humans without interference from NSAIDs or commonly administered medications . This method is suitable for quantification of fenofibric acid for clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients with dyslipidemia . D2-dopamine receptor and alpha2-adrenoreceptor-mediated analgesic response of quercetin . DB04216 , a bioflavonoid ( 100-300 mg/kg ) produced dose dependent increase in tail-flick latency , the analgesic effect being sensitive to reversal by naloxone ( 1 mg/kg ) . Prior treatment with haloperidol ( 1 mg/kg ) , D1/D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol , sulpiride ( 50 mg/kg ) , a selective D2 receptor antagonist , yohimbine ( 5 mg/kg ) , a alpha2-adrenoreceptor antagonist but not by P35240 23390 a , selective D1 receptor antagonist blocked this response . DB00714 ( 1 mg/kg ) a mixed D1/D2 dopamine receptor agonist , and quinpirole ( 0.5 mg/kg ) , a selective D2 receptor agonist also produced antinociception , that was reversed by haloperidol ( 1 mg/kg ) , sulpiride ( 50 mg/kg ) , but not by yohimbine ( 5 mg/kg ) . The antinociceptive action of quercetin ( 200 mg/kg ) was potentiated by D2 agonist quinpirole ( 0.2 mg/kg ) . P21728 agonist SKF38393 ( 10 and 15 mg/kg ) failed to alter the antinociceptive effect of quercetin ( 200 mg/kg ) . DB04216 ( 200 mg/kg ) reversed reserpine ( 2 mg/kg-4 hr ) induced hyperalgesia , which was reversed by sulpiride but not by yohimbine . Thus , a role of dopamine D2 and alpha2-adrenoreceptors is postulated in the antinociceptive action of quercetin . Genome-wide association study identifies genetic determinants of warfarin responsiveness for Japanese . DB00682 is a commonly used anticoagulant , whose dose needs to be determined for each individual patient owing to large inter-individual variability in its therapeutic dose . Although several clinical and genetic variables influencing warfarin dose have been identified , uncovering additional factors are critically important for safer use of warfarin . Through a genome-wide association study , we identified single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs2108622 [ cytochrome P450 , family 4 , subfamily F , polypeptide 2 ( P78329 ) ] as a genetic determinant of warfarin responsiveness for Japanese . Stratifying subjects who have been pre-classified according to the genotypes of SNP rs10509680 [ cytochrome P450 , family 2 , subfamily C , polypeptide 9 ( P11712 ) ] and SNP rs9923231 [ vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 ( Q9BQB6 ) ] , based on their genotypes of rs2108622 allowed identification of subjects who require higher dose of warfarin . Incorporating genotypes of rs2108622 into a warfarin dosing algorithm that considers age , body surface area , status of amiodarone co-administration and genotypes of SNPs in the P11712 and Q9BQB6 genes improved the model 's predictability to 43.4 % . In this study , the association of P78329 with warfarin dose of the Japanese has been established for the first time . Besides , a warfarin dosing algorithm that incorporates genotypes of rs2108622 and amiodarone co-administration status was suggested for the Japanese . Our study also implied that common SNPs other than those in the P11712 , Q9BQB6 and P78329 genes that show strong effect on the therapeutic warfarin dose might not exist . The potential role of PD0332991 ( DB09073 ) in the treatment of multiple myeloma . INTRODUCTION : Multiple myeloma ( MM ) remains an incurable malignancy indicating a need for continued investigation of novel therapies . Recent studies have highlighted the role of cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK ) in the pathogenesis of MM . PD0332991 ( DB09073 ) is an orally bioavailable , highly selective inhibitor of the P11802 /6-cyclin complex and downstream retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) activation pathway that induces cell cycle arrest in the P55008 phase . AREAS COVERED : In this review , the authors summarize the role of the P11802 /6 signaling pathway in MM . They also summarize the development of PD0332991 as a specific inhibitor of P11802 /6 , and the reported preclinical and clinical data supporting the potential role of PD0332991 in MM . EXPERT OPINION : While PD0332991 is essentially cytostatic , inducing prolonged P55008 arrest , it enhances the cytotoxic effect of other agents effective in MM , including bortezomib and lenalidomide , as confirmed in early phase clinical trials . However , with a plethora of other drugs of different classes being tested in MM , further development of PD0332991 will depend on defining the most efficacious combination with least toxicity . An unexplored opportunity remains the potential protective effect of PD0332991 against lytic bone lesions of MM . The next few years are likely to better define the place of PD0332991 in the treatment of MM .
Effective dasatinib uptake may occur without human organic cation transporter 1 ( O15245 ) : implications for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia . We have previously shown that imatinib uptake into chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells is dependent on human organic cation transporter 1 ( O15245 ; O15245 ) , and that low O15245 expression is an important determinant of clinical outcome to imatinib treatment . We hypothesized that dasatinib might be transported differently than imatinib , possibly accounting for its favorable effects in imatinib-resistant patients . (14)C-dasatinib uptake was greater in KCL22-transfected cells with pcDNA3- O15245 plasmid ( high O15245 -expressing cells ) than in control cells ( P = .02 ) . However , hOCT inhibitors did not decrease dasatinib uptake into either control or primary cells , in contrast to their block on imatinib uptake . Dasa-tinib decreased the level of phosphorylated CrkL to 49.9 % in control and 40.3 % in high O15245 -expressing cells . Dasa-tinib efflux was investigated in confluent P08183 -transfected MDCKII cell monolayers . Both dasatinib and imatinib were transported from the basal to the apical layer , indicating that they were transported by P08183 , which was confirmed using the P08183 inhibitor PSC833 ( P = .001 and P < .001 , respectively ) . Compared with imatinib , dasatinib achieved superior intracellular levels and P11274 - P00519 suppression even in cells with low or blocked O15245 . Efflux of dasatinib and imatinib appear similar via P08183 . Dasatinib may therefore offer an advantage over imatinib in patients with low O15245 expression . Enhancement of cytotoxicity of natural product drugs against multidrug resistant variant cell lines of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast carcinoma by tesmilifene . N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxyl]ethanamine ( tesmilifene ) , a tamoxifen derivative with antihistamine activity , greatly enhanced the survival of doxorubicin-treated , advanced stage breast cancer patients in a phase III trial . However , the molecular basis of tesmilifene action is not firmly established . The effects of tesmilifene on activity of several anticancer drugs was investigated using human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) and breast carcinoma cell lines as a model system . Multidrug resistant ( MDR ) variants of an HNSCC cell line , HN-5a/V15e , and a breast carcinoma cell line , MCF-7/V25a , both highly overexpressed mdr1 ( P08183 ) mRNA and the proteins P-glycoprotein and glutathione transferase-pi . Drug sensitivities were measured by a vital stain after 4 days of continuous exposure to anticancer drug in the absence and presence of tesmilifene at a concentration that alone had no antiproliferative effect . DB04905 had minimal effect on drug cytotoxicity against the parental cell lines . However , the same tesmilifene treatment enhanced cytotoxicity of docetaxel , paclitaxel , epirubicin , doxorubicin , and vinorelbine against both MDR cell lines by up to 50 % . Flow cytometric measurement of annexin V/propidium iodide staining demonstrated that tesmilifene increased the killing of HN-5a/V15e cells caused by docetaxel after 24 and 48h exposure . DB04905 increased accumulation of radiolabelled vincristine in HN-5a/V15e cells , over 4h , by up to 100 % . The results suggest that tesmilifene might be effective in the treatment of tumors that are resistant to natural product drugs . The mechanism of enhancement appears to be related to expression of an ABC pump-dependent , MDR phenotype . Alteration of intracellular histamine H2 receptor cycling precedes antagonist-induced upregulation . Long-term administration of a histamine H2 receptor ( P25021 ) antagonist ( inverse agonist ) induces upregulation of P25021 in parietal cells , which may be relevant to the rebound hypersecretion of gastric acid that occurs after withdrawal of treatment . The mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown . We hypothesized that the P25021 upregulation could be related to receptor trafficking and used P25021 -green fluorescent protein ( P25021 -GFP ) to test the hypothesis . Human P25021 -GFP was generated and functionally expressed in P29320 -293 cells . Binding of the P25021 antagonist [3H]tiotidine was performed to quantify P25021 expression , and P25021 -GFP was imaged in living cells by confocal and evanescent wave microscopy . The binding affinity of [3H]tiotidine was not significantly different between P25021 -GFP- and wild-type P25021 -expressing P29320 -293 cells , both of which had constitutive activity of adenylate cyclase . Visualization of P25021 -GFP revealed that the agonist-induced P25021 internalization and the antagonist-induced recycling of the internalized P25021 from the recycling endosome within 2 h . Long exposure to the antagonist increased GFP fluorescence in the plasma membrane and also induced upregulation of P25021 -GFP estimated by the binding assay , whereas long exposure to the agonist enhanced degradative trafficking of P25021 -GFP . We examined whether the upregulation reflected an increase in receptor synthesis . Treatment with antagonist did not augment P25021 mRNA , and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide had no effect on P25021 upregulation . These findings suggested that upon exposure to an antagonist ( inverse agonist ) , the equilibrium between receptor endocytosis and recycling is altered before P25021 upregulation , probably via suppressing P25021 degradation . P17931 -independent Down-regulation of Q9UBS5 due to Treatment with Korean Herbal Extract HAD-B Reduces Proliferation of Human Colon Cancer Cells . OBJECTIVES : Many efforts have shown multi-oncologic roles of galectin-3 for cell proliferation , angiogenesis , and apoptosis . However , the mechanisms by which galectin-3 is involved in cell proliferation are not yet fully understood , especially in human colon cancer cells . METHODS : To cluster genes showing positively or negatively correlated expression with galectin-3 , we employed human colon cancer cell lines , SNU-61 , SNU-81 , SNU-769B , SNU-C4 and SNU- P01031 in high-throughput gene expression profiling . Gene and protein expression levels were determined by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and western blot analysis , respectively . The proliferation rate of human colon cancer cells was measured by using a 3- ( 4 , 5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay . RESULTS : Expression of γ-aminobutyric acid B receptor 1 ( Q9UBS5 ) showed a positive correlation with galectin-3 at both the transcriptional and the translational levels . Downregulation of galectin-3 decreased not only Q9UBS5 expression but also the proliferation rate of human colon cancer cells . However , Korean herbal extract , HangAmDan-B ( HAD-B ) , decreased expression of Q9UBS5 without any expressional change of galectin-3 , and offset γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) -enhanced human colon cancer cell proliferation . CONCLUSIONS : Our present study confirmed that Q9UBS5 expression was regulated by galectin-3 . HAD-B induced galectin-3-independent down-regulation of Q9UBS5 , which resulted in a decreased proliferation of human colon cancer cells . The therapeutic effect of HAD-B for the treatment of human colon cancer needs to be further validated . The P08908 -receptor agonist flibanserin reduces drug-induced dyskinesia in O75916 -deficient mice . Drug-induced dyskinesia is a major complication of dopamine replacement therapy in advanced Parkinson 's disease consisting of dystonia , chorea and athetosis . Agonists at P08908 -receptors attenuate levodopa-induced motor complications in non-human primates . Mice with increased dopamine D2 receptor ( P14416 ) signalling due to the lack of expression of the regulator of G-protein signalling 9 ( O75916 ) also develop dyskinesia following levodopa treatment . We investigated whether the P08908 -receptor agonist flibanserin compared with buspirone reduces motor abnormalities induced by levodopa or quinelorane , a selective dopamine D2-receptor agonist . Following dopamine depletion via reserpine , 40 mice ( 20 wild-type and 20 O75916 knock-out ) were treated with flibanserin or buspirone in combination with levodopa or quinelorane . Motor behaviour was analysed using open field analysis . O75916 knock-out mice displayed significantly more drug-induced dystonia ( p < 0.04 ; t test ) than wild type . In quinelorane-treated wild-type mice flibanserin as well as buspirone significantly reduced dystonia ( p < 0.05 ) . In O75916 knock-out animals again both reduced quinelorane-induced dystonia . However , flibanserin was significantly more effective ( p = 0.003 ) . Following reserpine pretreatment and administration of levodopa wild-type and Q99697 9 knock-out mice showed mild to moderate dystonia . Surprisingly , 10 mg/kg buspirone increased dystonia in both animal groups , whereas it was decreased by 10 mg/kg flibanserin . However , compared with levodopa alone only the increase of dystonia by buspirone was significant ( p < 0.04 ) . DB04908 showed promising antidyskinetic effects in a model of drug-induced dyskinesia . Our data underline the possible benefit of P08908 agonists in drug-induced dyskinesia . Novel MEK inhibitor trametinib and other retinoblastoma gene ( RB ) -reactivating agents enhance efficacy of 5-fluorouracil on human colon cancer cells . Chemotherapy for colorectal cancer has become more complicated and diversified with the appearance of molecular-targeting agents . DB00544 ( DB00544 ) has been a mainstay of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer , but it is still unknown whether the combining of DB00544 with novel molecular-targeting agents is effective . P04818 ( TS ) is a direct target of DB00544 , and the low TS level has been generally supposed to sensitize DB00544 's efficacy . We therefore hypothesized that RB-reactivating agents could enhance the efficacy of DB00544 , because the RB-reactivating agents could suppress the function of transcription factor E2F of TS gene promoter . We used three RB-reactivating agents , trametinib/GSK1120212 ( MEK inhibitor ) , fenofibrate ( Q07869 α agonist ) , and LY294002 ( PI3K inhibitor ) , with DB00544 against human colon cancer HT-29 and HCT15 cells . DB08911 induced p15 and p27 expression and reduced cyclin D1 levels in HT-29 cells . Fenofibrate also dephosphorlated P27361 /2 and reduced cyclin D1 levels in HT-29 cells . LY294002 induced p27 expression in HCT15 cells . All three agents caused dephosphorylation of RB protein and P55008 -phase arrest with a reduction of TS expression . As a consequence , the combination of DB00544 with each of the agents resulted in a significant decrease of colony numbers in HT-29 or HCT15 cells . These results suggest " RB-reactivation therapy " using molecular-targeting agents to be a new strategy for DB00544 -based chemotherapy . In particular , we strongly expect trametinib , which was discovered in Japan and was recently submitted to FDA for approval , to be used together with established regimens for colorectal cancer . Complex formation with the Type B gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor affects the expression and signal transduction of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor . Studies with P29320 -293 cells and neurons . We co-immunoprecipitated the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor ( CaR ) and type B gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor ( GABA-B-R ) from human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) -293 cells expressing these receptors and from brain lysates where both receptors are present . CaRs extensively co-localized with the two subunits of the GABA-B-R ( Q96GN5 and R2 ) in P29320 -293 cell membranes and intracellular organelles . Coexpressing CaRs and GABA-B-R1s in P29320 -293 cells suppressed the total cellular and cell surface expression of CaRs and inhibited phospholipase C activation in response to high extracellular [ Ca(2+) ] ( [Ca(2+)](e) ) . In contrast , coexpressing CaRs and GABA-B-R2s enhanced CaR expression and signaling responses to raising [Ca(2+)](e) . The latter effects of the O75899 on the CaR were blunted by coexpressing the Q9UBS5 . Coexpressing the CaR with Q9UBS5 or R2 enhanced the total cellular and cell surface expression of the Q9UBS5 or R2 , respectively . Studies with truncated CaRs indicated that the N-terminal extracellular domain of the CaR participated in the interaction of the CaR with the Q9UBS5 and R2 . In cultured mouse hippocampal neurons , CaRs co-localized with the Q9UBS5 and R2 . CaRs and GABA-B-R1s also co-immunoprecipitated from brain lysates . The expression of the CaR was increased in lysates from Q9UBS5 knock-out mouse brains and in cultured hippocampal neurons with their Q9UBS5 genes deleted in vitro . Thus , CaRs and GABA-B-R subunits can form heteromeric complexes in cells , and their interactions affect cell surface expression and signaling of CaR , which may contribute to extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent receptor activation in target tissues . Puerarin alleviates noise-induced hearing loss via affecting PKCγ and GABAB receptor expression . Noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) often results from prolonged exposure to high levels of noise . Our previous study revealed that during the development of NIHL , the expression of protein kinase C γ subunit ( PKCγ ) and GABAB receptor ( GABABR ) was changed within the cochlear nuclear complex ( CNC ) , suggesting that these molecules might be the potential targets for the treatment of NIHL . As an extending study , here we focused on puerarin , a major isoflavonoid extracted from Pueraria lobota , which has been used in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases , and investigated whether it could protect against NIHL by acting on PKCγ and GABABR . Transgenic Q99259 -GFP knock-in mice were subjected to the NIHL model and their auditory functions were evaluated by the auditory brainstem response thresholds and distortion product oto-acoustic emission signals . Our results showed that 200mg/kg puerarin treatment ameliorated the thresholds of auditory brainstem response of NIHL mice significantly . Triple immunofluorescence staining and electron microscopy results revealed that GFP-positive neurons in the superficial layers of CNC expressed both PKCγ and Q9UBS5 , and Q99259 -positive terminals contacted PKCγ- or Q9UBS5 -positive neurons . Immunoblotting and RT-PCR results showed that NIHL increased the expression of PKCγ but decreased that of Q9UBS5 and O75899 at both protein and mRNA levels in the CNC . Puerarin significantly attenuated the increased expression of PKCγ but elevated the reduced expression of Q9UBS5 and O75899 after noise exposure . Thus , we provided the first evidence that puerarin ameliorated the auditory functions of NIHL mice , and this effect may be due to its ability to regulate the expression of PKCγ and GABABR . Type B gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors modulate the function of the extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor and cell differentiation in murine growth plate chondrocytes . Extracellular calcium-sensing receptors ( CaRs ) and metabotropic or type B gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors ( GABA-B-Rs ) , two closely related members of family C of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily , dimerize in the formation of signaling and membrane-anchored receptor complexes . We tested whether CaRs and two GABA-B-R subunits ( Q96GN5 and R2 ) are expressed in mouse growth plate chondrocytes ( GPCs ) by PCR and immunocytochemistry and whether interactions between these receptors influence the expression and function of the CaR and extracellular Ca(2+)-mediated cell differentiation . Both CaRs and the Q9UBS5 and -R2 were expressed in the same zones of the growth plate and extensively colocalized in intracellular compartments and on the membranes of cultured GPCs . The Q9UBS5 co-immunoprecipitated with the CaR , confirming a physical interaction between the two receptors in GPCs . In vitro knockout of Q9UBS5 genes , using a Cre-lox recombination strategy , blunted the ability of high extracellular Ca(2+) concentration to activate phospholipase C and P27361 /2 , suppressed cell proliferation , and enhanced apoptosis in cultured GPCs . In GPCs , in which the Q9UBS5 was acutely knocked down , there was reduced expression of early chondrocyte markers , aggrecan and type II collagen , and increased expression of the late differentiation markers , type X collagen and osteopontin . These results support the idea that physical interactions between CaRs and GABA-B-R1s modulate the growth and differentiation of GPCs , potentially by altering the function of CaRs . Modulatory effects of heparin and short-length oligosaccharides of heparin on the metastasis and growth of LMD MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells in vivo . Expression of the chemokine receptor P61073 allows breast cancer cells to migrate towards specific metastatic target sites which constitutively express P48061 . In this study , we determined whether this interaction could be disrupted using short-chain length heparin oligosaccharides . Radioligand competition binding assays were performed using a range of heparin oligosaccharides to compete with polymeric heparin or heparan sulphate binding to I(125) P48061 . DB01109 dodecasaccharides were found to be the minimal chain length required to efficiently bind P48061 ( 71 % inhibition ; P < 0.001 ) . These oligosaccharides also significantly inhibited P48061 -induced migration of P61073 -expressing LMD MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells . In addition , heparin dodecasaccharides were found to have less anticoagulant activity than either a smaller quantity of polymeric heparin or a similar amount of the low molecular weight heparin pharmaceutical product , DB06822 . When given subcutaneously in a SCID mouse model of human breast cancer , heparin dodecasaccharides had no effect on the number of lung metastases , but did however inhibit ( P < 0.05 ) tumour growth ( lesion area ) compared to control groups . In contrast , polymeric heparin significantly inhibited both the number ( P < 0.001 ) and area of metastases , suggesting a differing mechanism for the action of polymeric and heparin-derived oligosaccharides in the inhibition of tumour growth and metastases . [ Differential gene expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell with reduced and normal expression of 6A8 alpha-mannosidase ] . OBJECTIVE : To detect the differential display of mRNA expression between human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell CNE-2L2 with reduced malignancy caused by transduction of a DNA antisense to 6A8 alpha-mannosidase cDNA ( AS cell ) and the wild type cell ( W cell ) . METHODS : Differential display of mRNA expression was analyzed using DNA microarray analysis . The datasets were confirmed by Northern blotting and RT-PCR . RESULTS : Out of the 1069 genes analyzed , 34 genes were up-regulated in AS cells relative to W cells . Conversely , 42 genes were down-regulated . The genes , up-regulation of which might have suppressive effect on tumor malignant behaviors , were P130 mRNA for 130K protein , TGF-betaIIR alpha , Q9UBS5 , P36897 , Q13829 , STANIN , E-CADHERIN , P35221 and 2 , P48378 , TMPO , etc . The genes , down-regulation of which might have suppressive effect on tumor malignant behaviors , were P16070 , Q92597 , P01137 , P46782 , LEGUMAIIN , P35520 , P13987 , P09661 , etc . The microarray datasets were confirmed by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis . CONCLUSIONS : In comparison to the W cell , AS cell has up-regulation of 34 genes and down-regulation of 42 genes . Changes of the gene expression may play a role in the malignancy reduction of AS cell . [ CT analysis of developmental spinal canal stenosis ] . The cervical and the lumbar vertebrae were analyzed by computed tomography in two groups . One group consisted of the patients with developmental stenosis of the cervical spine ( the smallest AP diameter of the cervical spinal canal in the lateral view of X-ray was less than 12 mm ) and the other was the control group ( the smallest diameter was more than 14 mm ) . The canal to body ratio of the cross-sectional area ( P16152 ) , the modified Jones ' " canal to body ratio " ( JNS ) and the flat index of the vertebral canal ( FI ) were measured at C4, P01031 , P13671 , Q9NP50 and Q15004 . The shape of the vertebral canal of Q9NP50 and Q15004 was classified according to Baddeley . In the stenosis group , P16152 and JNS were smaller at every measured level and FI was smaller at C4 , P01031 and P13671 compared with the control group , Trefoil canals were found more frequently in the stenosis group . There was a clear relationship between the developmental stenosis of the cervical and the lumbar spinal canal . On treating patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy , one should consider the possibility of pan-spinal canal stenosis . Molecular identification of the human O75899 : cell surface expression and coupling to adenylyl cyclase in the absence of Q9UBS5 . We have identified a gene encoding a GABAB receptor , the human O75899 , located on chromosome 9q22.1 , that is distinct from the recently reported rat Q9UBS5 . O75899 structurally resembles Q9UBS5 ( 35 % identity ) , having seven transmembrane domains and a large extracellular region , but differs in having a longer carboxy-terminal tail . O75899 is localized to the cell surface in transfected COS cells , and negatively couples to adenylyl cyclase in response to GABA , baclofen , and 3-aminopropyl(methyl)phosphinic acid in CHO cells lacking Q9UBS5 . DB00181 action is inhibited by the GABABR antagonist , 2-hydroxysaclofen . The human O75899 and Q9UBS5 genes are differentially expressed in the nervous system , with the greatest difference being detected in the striatum in which Q9UBS5 but not O75899 mRNA transcripts are detected . O75899 and Q9UBS5 mRNAs are also coexpressed in various brain regions such as the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum . Identification of a functional homomeric O75899 coupled to adenylyl cyclase suggests that the complexity of GABAB pharmacological data is at least in part due to the presence of more than one receptor and opens avenues for future research leading to an understanding of metabotropic GABA receptor signal transduction mechanisms . Immunocytochemical localization of Q9UBS5 receptor subunits in the basolateral amygdala . Gamma-aminobutyric acid B ( GABAB ) receptors ( GBRs ) are G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate a slow , prolonged form of inhibition in the basolateral amygdala ( P00519 ) and other brain areas . Recent studies indicate that this receptor is a heterodimer consisting of Q9UBS5 ( GBR1 ) and O75899 subunits . In the present investigation , antibodies to the Q9UBS5 subunit were used to study the neuronal localization of GBRs in the rat P00519 . GBR immunoreactivity was mainly found in spine-sparse interneurons and astrocytes at the light microscopic level . Very few pyramidal neurons exhibited perikaryal staining . Dual-labeling immunofluorescence analysis indicated that each of the four main subpopulations of interneurons exhibited GBR immunoreactivity . Virtually 100 % of large CCK+ neurons in the basolateral and lateral nuclei were GBR+ . In the basolateral nucleus 72 % of somatostatin ( Q8TE85 ) , 73 % of parvalbumin ( PV ) and 25 % of P01282 positive interneurons were GBR+ . In the lateral nucleus 50 % of somatostatin , 30 % of parvalbumin and 27 % of P01282 positive interneurons were GBR+ . Electron microscopic ( EM ) analysis revealed that most of the light neuropil staining seen at the light microscopic level was due to the staining of dendritic shafts and spines , most of which probably belonged to spiny pyramidal cells . Very few axon terminals ( Ats ) were GBR+ . In summary , this investigation demonstrates that the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells , and varying percentages of each of the four main subpopulations of interneurons in the P00519 , express GBRs . Because previous studies suggest that GBR-mediated inhibition modulates DB01221 -dependent EPSPs in the P00519 , these receptors may play an important role in neuronal plasticity related to emotional learning . Role of histamine receptors in the effects of histamine on the production of reactive oxygen species by whole blood phagocytes . AIMS : The diverse physiological functions of histamine are mediated through distinct histamine receptors . In this study we investigated the role of P25021 and Q9H3N8 in the effects of histamine on the production of reactive oxygen species by phagocytes in whole blood . MAIN METHODS : Changes in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production by whole blood phagocytes after treatment with histamine , Q9H3N8 agonists ( 4-methylhistamine , VUF8430 ) , P25021 agonist ( dimaprit ) and their combinations with Q9H3N8 antagonist ( JNJ10191584 ) and P25021 antagonist ( ranitidine ) were determined using the chemiluminescence ( CL ) assay . To exclude the direct scavenging effects of the studied compounds on the CL response , the antioxidant properties of all compounds were measured using several methods ( TRAP , ORAC , and luminol-HRP-H2O2 based CL ) . KEY FINDINGS : DB11320 , 4-methylhistamine , VUF8430 and dimaprit inhibited the spontaneous and OZP-activated whole blood CL in a dose-dependent manner . On the other hand , only VUF8430 was able to inhibit PMA-activated whole blood CL . DB00863 , but not JNJ10191584 , completely reduced the effects of histamine , 4-methylhistamine and dimaprit . The direct scavenging ability of tested compounds was negligible . SIGNIFICANCE : Our results demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of histamine on ROS production in whole blood phagocytes were caused by P25021 . Our results also suggest that Q9H3N8 agonists in concentrations higher than 10(-6)M may also influence ROS production via binding to P25021 . DB09280 - DB08820 in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Homozygous for Phe508del P13569 . Influence of immunomodulatory drugs on the cytotoxicity induced by monoclonal antibody 17-1A and interleukin-2 . Patients treated with monoclonal antibodies and cytokines for cancer receive often co-medication , which may influence treatment efficacy . Therefore , we investigated with a flowcytometric cytotoxicity assay the effect of several immunomodulatory drugs on antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) , interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) induced cytotoxicity and P60568 -induced-ADCC . We found that dexamethasone markedly inhibited the P60568 induced cytotoxicity and the P60568 -induced-ADCC . DB00904 , a P46098 serotonin receptor antagonist augmented significantly ADCC . Clemastine , a histamine type-2 receptor antagonist augmented the P60568 -induced-ADCC . The P01375 antagonist thalidomide suppressed ADCC whereas pentoxifylline proved to be ineffective . Other tested drugs namely ibuprofen and indomethacin , both prostaglandin E2 antagonists , cimetidine a histamine type-2 receptor antagonist , the opioid pethidine , prostaglandin E2 and histamine exerted minor effects or had no influence on the tested parameters . We conclude that glucocorticosteroids should be avoided with monoclonal antibody and cytokine treatment . According to our in vitro data the other drugs tested did not have a negative impact on cellular cytotoxicity and ADCC . Synthesis , biological activity and HPLC validation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine derivatives as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . The synthesis and biochemical evaluation of new hybrids of tacrine ( DB00382 ) and 4-fluorobenzoic acid ( 4-FBA ) possessing activity towards acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) and butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) inhibition are presented . The compounds of interest were obtained from the reaction of activated 4-FBA and diamino derivatives of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine . The compounds P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -4KW/HCl and P13671 -3KW/HCl have four-fold higher antiacetylcholinesterase activity than DB00382 . All of the acquired compounds present higher selectivity towards P22303 than DB00382 and lower selectivity towards BuChE . In addition , a rapid , selective and stability-indicating HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl . DB00382 and 4-FBA were found to be the main impurities . Chromatographic separation was achieved isocratically on a Waters Symmetry C18 150 × 3.9 mm , 4 μm column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/buffer ( 17 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate and 8.3 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate , 50:50 v/v ) ( overall pH 4 ) . A 1.5 ml/min flow rate and a 247 nm wavelength were chosen for this method . P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl were subjected to acidic and basic hydrolysis , chemical oxidation , thermal exposition at 60 °C and intense UV light . The limits of detection ( LOD ) and quantification ( LOQ ) were less than 2 μg/ml and 6 μg/ml for P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl , 0.04 μg/ml and 0.12 μg/ml for DB00382 , 0.42 μg/ml and 1.41 μg/ml for 4-FBA , respectively . Molecular and biochemical analysis of calmodulin interactions with the calmodulin-binding domain of plant glutamate decarboxylase . We previously provided what to our knowledge is the first evidence that plant glutamate decarboxylase ( Q99259 ) is a calmodulin ( P62158 ) -binding protein . Here , we studied the Q99259 P62158 -binding domain in detail . A synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids corresponding to this domain forms a stable complex with Ca2+/ P62158 with a 1:1 stoichiometry , and amino acid substitutions suggest that tryptophan-485 has an indispensable role in P62158 binding . Chemical cross-linking revealed specific P62158 / Q99259 interactions even in the absence of Ca2+ . However , increasing KCI concentrations or deletion of two carboxy-terminal lysines abolished these interactions but had a mild effect on P62158 / Q99259 interactions in the presence of Ca2+ . We conclude that in the presence of Ca(2+)-hydrophobic interactions involving tryptophan-485 and electrostatic interactions involving the carboxy-terminal lysines mediate P62158 / Q99259 complex formation . By contrast , in the absence of Ca2+ , P62158 / Q99259 interactions are essentially electrostatic and involve the carboxy-terminal lysines . In addition , a tryptophan residue and carboxy-terminal lysines are present in the P62158 -binding domain of an Arabidopsis Q99259 . Finally , we demonstrate that petunia Q99259 activity is stimulated in vitro by Ca2+/ P62158 . Our study provides a molecular basis for Ca(2+)-dependent P62158 / Q99259 interactions and suggests the possible occurrence of Ca(2+)-independent P62158 / Q99259 interactions . Interplay between inhibitory ferric and stimulatory curcumin regulates phosphorylation-dependent human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and ΔF508 activity . Curcumin potentiates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) activation in an DB00171 -independent but phosphorylation-dependent manner . The underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear . Here , P29320 -293T cells cultured in an Fe(3+)-containing medium were transiently transfected with P13569 constructs , and the role of the inhibitory Fe(3+) bridge between intracellular loop 3 and the regulatory domain of P13569 in this pathway was investigated . The results showed that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( DB00974 ) stimulated phosphorylation-dependent P13569 activation and the stimulation was suppressed by the deletion of the regulatory domain or the insertion of a C832A mutation that removes the Fe(3+)-binding interface . Furthermore , curcumin potentiation of P13569 was significantly weakened not only by Fe(3+)-insensitive mutations at the interface between the regulatory domain and intracellular loop 3 but also by N-ethylmaleimide or DB00974 pretreatment that removes Fe(3+) . More importantly , potentiation of P13569 was completely suppressed by sufficient Fe(3+) . Finally , the insertion of Fe(3+)-insensitive H950R/S768R increased the curcumin-independent activity of ΔF508 but weakened its curcumin potentiation . Thus , Fe(3+) homeostasis in epithelia may play a critical role in regulating P13569 activity , and targeting Fe(3+)-chelating potentiators may direct new therapies for cystic fibrosis . Identification of cell surface targets for HIV-1 therapeutics using genetic screens . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) drugs designed to interfere with obligatory utilization of certain host cell factors by virus are less likely to encounter development of resistant strains than drugs directed against viral components . Several cellular genes required for productive infection by HIV were identified by the use of genetic suppressor element ( GSE ) technology as potential targets for anti-HIV drug development . Fragmented cDNA libraries from various pools of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were expressed in vitro in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) -susceptible cell lines and subjected to genetic screens to identify GSEs that interfered with viral replication . After three rounds of selection , more than 15000 GSEs were sequenced , and the cognate genes were identified . The GSEs that inhibited the virus were derived from a diverse set of genes including cell surface receptors , cytokines , signaling proteins , transcription factors , as well as genes with unknown function . Approximately 2.5 % of the identified genes were previously shown to play a role in the HIV-1 life cycle ; this finding supports the biological relevance of the assay . GSEs were derived from the following 12 cell surface proteins : P61073 , CCR4 , P32248 , P20702 , P16070 , Q08722 , P34810 , Q07108 , P04233 , Q99062 , Q9UBS5 , and P20333 . Requirement of some of these genes for viral infection was also investigated by using RNA interference ( RNAi ) technology ; accordingly , 10 genes were implicated in early events of the viral life cycle , before viral DNA synthesis . Thus , these cell surface proteins represent novel targets for the development of therapeutics against HIV-1 infection and AIDS . Stage-dependent inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum by potent Ca2+ and calmodulin modulators . The effects of Ca2+ channel blockers , verapamil , nicardipine and diltiazem , and of potent calmodulin ( P62158 ) inhibitors , trifluoperazine ( Q9HCM9 ) , calmidazolium , W-7 and W-5 , on Plasmodium falciparum in culture were examined . Among Ca2+ blockers , nicardipine was the most potent with the 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) of 4.3 microM at 72 h after culture . Parasites were more sensitive to calmidazolium and W-7 with IC50 of 3.4 and 4.5 microM , respectively , than to Q9HCM9 and W-5 . All Ca2+ blockers and P62158 inhibitors suppressed parasite development at later stages . DB00622 , diltiazem , calmidazolium and W-5 also retarded parasite development at earlier stages and/or subsequent growth following pretreatment . Verapamil , nicardipine , Q9HCM9 and calmidazolium reduced erythrocyte invasion by merozoites . Fluorescence microscopy with the cationic fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 revealed that nicardipine , Q9HCM9 and calmidazolium depolarized both the plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane potentials of the parasite . It is therefore considered that although all Ca2+ and P62158 antagonists tested here influence parasite development at later stages , they are multifunctional , having effects not directly associated with Ca2+ channels or P62158 . Alloreactive memory T cells are responsible for the persistence of graft-versus-host disease . Graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) is caused by a donor T cell anti-host reaction that evolves over several weeks to months , suggesting a requirement for persistent alloreactive T cells . Using the C3H.SW anti-C57BL/6 ( B6 ) mouse model of human GVHD directed against minor histocompatibility Ags , we found that donor CD8(+) T cells secreting high levels of P01579 in GVHD B6 mice receiving C3H.SW naive CD8(+) T cells peaked by day 14 , declined by day 28 after transplantation , and persisted thereafter , corresponding to the kinetics of a memory T cell response . Donor CD8(+) T cells recovered on day 42 after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation expressed the phenotype of P16070 (high)CD122(high)CD25(low) , were able to homeostatically survive in response to P60568 , P13232 , and P40933 and rapidly proliferated upon restimulation with host dendritic cells . Both allogeneic effector memory ( P16070 (high)CD62L(low) ) and central memory ( P16070 (high)CD62L(high) ) CD8(+) T cells were identified in B6 mice with ongoing GVHD , with effector memory CD8(+) T cells as the dominant ( > 80 % ) population . Administration of these allogeneic memory CD8(+) T cells into secondary B6 recipients caused virulent GVHD . A similar allogeneic memory P01730 (+) T cell population with the ability to mediate persistent GVHD was also identified in BALB/b mice receiving minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched B6 T cell-replete bone marrow transplantation . These results indicate that allogeneic memory T cells are generated in vivo during GVH reactions and are able to cause GVHD , resulting in persistent host tissue injury . Thus , in vivo blockade of both alloreactive effector and memory T cell-mediated host tissue injury may prove to be valuable for GVHD prevention and treatment . Association study of 45 candidate genes in nicotine dependence in Han Chinese . Numerous genetic linkages , association studies have been performed in different ethnic groups and revealed many susceptibility loci and genes for nicotine dependence . However , limited similar researches were performed in Han Chinese . This study was designed to investigate the association of candidate genes with nicotine dependence in Han Chinese . We genotyped 384 SNPs within 45 candidate genes with nicotine dependence in a Han Chinese population consisting 223 high nicotine dependent subjects and 257 low nicotine dependent subjects by employing GoldenGate genotyping assay ( Illumina ) . Following association analysis was performed using PLINK software . Individual SNP-based association analysis revealed that nine SNPs located in P35462 ( rs2630351 ) , P21918 ( rs1967550 ) , Q9Y6R4 ( rs2314378 ) , DDC ( rs11575461 ) , Q05901 ( rs4954 ) , O75899 ( rs2779562 ) , P14416 ( rs11214613 and rs6589377 ) and P43681 ( rs2236196 ) were significantly associated with FTND after correction for multiple testing with the p values from 2.59×10(-7) to 9.99×10(-5) . Haplotype-based association analysis revealed haplotype G-A-A formed by rs2630351 , rs167771 and rs324032 and haplotype G-G-G-A formed by rs3773678 , rs2630349 , rs2630351 and rs167771 in P35462 ; haplotype of G-A formed by rs2779562 and rs2808566 in O75899 and haplotype of T-T-A-G-A formed by rs6832644 , rs4057797 , rs9764 , rs4552421 and rs10033119 in P25929 are associated with FTND ( p=3.61×10(-7)-8.78×10(-6) ) . Our results provided confirmation of the previous findings that P14416 , P35462 , DDC , Q05901 , O75899 and P43681 are associated with nicotine dependence . Furthermore , we for the first time report a significant association between nicotine dependence and P21918 , Q9Y6R4 and P25929 . These findings need independent replication in the future studies .
Enhancement of cytotoxicity of natural product drugs against multidrug resistant variant cell lines of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast carcinoma by tesmilifene . N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxyl]ethanamine ( tesmilifene ) , a tamoxifen derivative with antihistamine activity , greatly enhanced the survival of doxorubicin-treated , advanced stage breast cancer patients in a phase III trial . However , the molecular basis of tesmilifene action is not firmly established . The effects of tesmilifene on activity of several anticancer drugs was investigated using human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) and breast carcinoma cell lines as a model system . Multidrug resistant ( MDR ) variants of an HNSCC cell line , HN-5a/V15e , and a breast carcinoma cell line , MCF-7/V25a , both highly overexpressed mdr1 ( P08183 ) mRNA and the proteins P-glycoprotein and glutathione transferase-pi . Drug sensitivities were measured by a vital stain after 4 days of continuous exposure to anticancer drug in the absence and presence of tesmilifene at a concentration that alone had no antiproliferative effect . DB04905 had minimal effect on drug cytotoxicity against the parental cell lines . However , the same tesmilifene treatment enhanced cytotoxicity of docetaxel , paclitaxel , epirubicin , doxorubicin , and vinorelbine against both MDR cell lines by up to 50 % . Flow cytometric measurement of annexin V/propidium iodide staining demonstrated that tesmilifene increased the killing of HN-5a/V15e cells caused by docetaxel after 24 and 48h exposure . DB04905 increased accumulation of radiolabelled vincristine in HN-5a/V15e cells , over 4h , by up to 100 % . The results suggest that tesmilifene might be effective in the treatment of tumors that are resistant to natural product drugs . The mechanism of enhancement appears to be related to expression of an ABC pump-dependent , MDR phenotype . [ P35354 inhibitor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , myth or reality ? ] . The discovery of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase , Cox-1 constitutive and Cox-2 inducible , has prompted the development of new molecules with high Cox-2 selectivity . These new NSAIDs belong to the coxib class and have theoretically a better digestive tolerability than classical NSAID have . In Belgium , rofecoxib ( ( Vioxx ) and celecoxib ( DB00482 ) are commercialized . DB00533 is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis ( 12.5 to 25 mg/d ) and celecoxib is indicated in osteoarthritis ( 200 mg/d ) and in rheumatoid arthritis ( 200 to 400 mg/d ) . Several studies have demonstrated their efficacy , similarly to classical NSAID as diclofenac ( Voltaren ) , naproxen ( Naprosyne ) , ibuprofen ( DB01050 ) and their superiority compared to placebo . Their safety profile for gastrointestinal events is proven in patients without ulcer history compared to classical NSAID . However , the concomitant use of aspirin decreases the benefit as demonstrated for celecoxib at 400 mg/d but not investigated for rofecoxib . The selective inhibition of Cox-2 with no effect on Cox-1 favors cardiovascular events in patients at risk . Other side effects are similar to classical NSAID . Thus Cox-2 inhibitors NSAID are interesting molecules for their sparing gastrointestinal activity . They must be used with caution in patients with ulcer history , in the elderly and in patients requiring aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis . Growth of V79 cells as xenograft tumors promotes multicellular resistance but does not increase spontaneous or radiation-induced mutant frequency . A Chinese hamster V79 xenograft model was developed to determine whether cells subjected to a hypoxic tumor microenvironment would be more likely to undergo mutation at the P00492 locus . V79-171b cells stably transfected with P15692 and EGFP were grown subcutaneously in immunodeficient NOD/ SCID mice . V79-VE tumors were characterized for host cell infiltration , doubling time , hypoxic fraction , vascular perfusion , and response to ionizing radiation . When irradiated in vitro , the mutant frequency for a given surviving fraction did not differ for cells grown in vivo or in vitro . Similar results were obtained using HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells grown as xenografts . However , V79-VE cells grown as xenografts were significantly more resistant to killing than monolayers . The background mutant frequency and the radiation-induced mutant frequency did not differ for tumor cells close to or distant from blood vessels . Similarly , tumor cells from well-perfused regions showed the same rate of strand break rejoining and the same rate of loss of phosphorylated histone P16104 as cells sorted from poorly perfused regions . Therefore , deleterious effects of the tumor microenvironment on DNA repair efficiency or mutation induction could not be demonstrated in these tumors . Rather , development of multicellular resistance in V79-VE tumors acted to reduce mutant frequency for a given dose of radiation . Emergence of FGFR family gene fusions as therapeutic targets in a wide spectrum of solid tumours . The emergence of fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) family fusions across diverse cancers has brought attention to FGFR-derived cancer therapies . The discovery of the first recurrent FGFR fusion in glioblastoma was followed by discoveries of FGFR fusions in bladder , lung , breast , thyroid , oral , and prostate cancers . Drug targeting of FGFR fusions has shown promising results and should soon be translating into clinical trials . FGFR fusions form as a result of various mechanisms – predominantly deletion for P11362 , translocation for P21802 , and tandem duplication for P22607 . The ability to exploit the unique targetability of FGFR fusions proves that FGFR-derived therapies could have a promising future in cancer therapeutics . Drug targeting of fusion genes has proven to be an extremely effective therapeutic approach for cancers such as the recurrent BCR– P00519 fusion in chronic myeloid leukaemia . The recent discovery of recurrent FGFR family fusions in several cancer types has brought to attention the unique therapeutic potential for FGFR-positive patients . Understanding the diverse mechanisms of FGFR fusion formation and their oncogenic potential will shed light on the impact of FGFR-derived therapy in the future . P11362 - 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A heteroreceptor complexes and their enhancement of hippocampal plasticity . BACKGROUND : The hippocampus and its 5-hydroxytryptamine transmission plays an important role in depression related to its involvement in limbic circuit plasticity . METHODS : The analysis was made with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer , co-immunoprecipitation , in situ proximity ligation assay , binding assay , in cell western and the forced swim test . RESULTS : Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analysis , fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ( P11362 ) -5-hydroxytryptamine 1A ( P08908 ) receptor complexes have been demonstrated and their specificity and agonist modulation characterized . Their presence based on co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay has also been indicated in hippocampal cultures and rat dorsal hippocampal formation showing a neuronal location . In vitro assays on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation have shown synergistic increases in signaling on coactivation with fibroblast growth factor 2 ( P09038 ) and a P08908 agonist , and dependent on the heteroreceptor interface . In vitro and in vivo studies also revealed a P08908 agonist induced phosphorylation of P11362 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in rat hippocampus without changing P09038 levels . Co-activation of the heteroreceptor also resulted in synergistic increases in extensions of PC12 cells and neurite densities and protrusions in primary hippocampal cultures dependent on the receptor interface . The combined acute and repeated intracerebroventricular treatment with P09038 and 8-OH-DPAT was found to produce evidence of highly significant antidepressant actions in the forced swim test . CONCLUSIONS : The findings indicate that neurotrophic and antidepressant effects of 5-HT in brain may , in part , be mediated by activation of the P08908 receptor protomer in the hippocampal P11362 - P08908 receptor complex enhancing the P11362 signaling . Aripiprazole : a novel atypical antipsychotic drug with a uniquely robust pharmacology . Aripiprazole ( DB01238 ) is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been recently introduced for clinical use in the treatment of schizophrenia . Aripiprazole has a unique pharmacologic profile that includes partial agonism at several G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) [ especially dopamine ( D2 ) and P08908 ] and antagonistic action at others ( especially 5- Q13049 ) . Clinical trials indicate that aripiprazole is effective in treating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . In short-term studies rapid onset of action ( within one week ) has been demonstrated . Preliminary data indicate that aripiprazole may also be effective in the treatment of manic symptoms of bipolar disorder . At recommended doses , aripiprazole appears to be safe and well tolerated in most adult patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder . There is only limited information available on the use of aripiprazole in children and adolescents , and pilot data suggest that a revised dosing strategy , based on weight , is indicated in this population . In the long-term studies , the use of aripiprazole was associated with continued efficacy , good compliance and increased time-to-relapse . Aripiprazole represents the first functionally selective atypical antipsychotic drug . DB01281 inhibits effector T cells through regulatory T cells and TGF-β . The P10747 costimulatory receptor is a critical regulator of T cell function , making it an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases . DB01281 , now approved for use in humans , prevents naive T cell activation by binding to P33681 proteins and blocking engagement of P10747 . However , DB01281 suppresses inflammation even if administered when disease is established , suggesting alternative mechanisms . We identified a novel , P10747 -independent mechanism by which DB01281 inhibits activated T cells . We show that in vitro , DB01281 synergizes with NO from bone marrow-derived macrophages to inhibit T cell proliferation . Depletion of regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) or interference with TGF-β signaling abrogated the inhibitory effect of DB01281 . Parallel in vivo experiments using an allergic airway inflammation model demonstrated that this novel mechanism required both macrophages and regulatory T cells . Furthermore , DB01281 was ineffective in P84022 -deficient mice , supporting a requirement for TGF-β signaling . Thus , in addition to preventing naive T cells from being fully activated , DB01281 can turn off already activated effector T cells by an NO/regulatory T cell/TGF-β-dependent pathway . This mechanism is similar to cell-extrinsic effects of endogenous P16410 and may be particularly important in the ability of DB01281 to treat chronic inflammatory disease . DB00909 block of cloned human T-type voltage-gated calcium channels . DB00909 ( ZNS ) is a multi-target antiepileptic drug reported to be efficient in the treatment of both partial and generalized seizures , with T-type Ca(2+) channel blockade being one of its proposed mechanisms of action . In this study , we systematically investigated electrophysiological effects of ZNS on cloned human Ca(v)3.1-3.3 Ca(2+) channels in a heterologous P29320 -293 expression system using whole cell patch-clamp technique . Concentration-response studies were performed in the range from 5 microM to 2mM for Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) channels exhibiting a 15.4-30.8 % reduction of Ca(2+) influx within the maximum therapeutic plasma range ( 50-200 microM ZNS ) . The other T-type Ca(2+) channel entities , Ca(v)3.1 and Q9P0X4 , were even less sensitive to ZNS . Both voltage- and concentration-dependence of inactivation kinetics remained unchanged for Ca(v)3.2 VGCC , whereas Ca(v)3.1 and Q9P0X4 exhibited minor , though significant reduction of inactivation-tau . Interestingly , ZNS block of Ca(v)3.2 VGCCs was not use-dependent and remained unaffected by changes in the holding potential . Steady-state inactivation studies did not display a significant shift in steady-state availability of Ca(v)3.2 channels at 100 microM ZNS ( DeltaV(1/2)=3.1mV , p=0.071 ) . Our studies indicate that ZNS is a moderate blocker of human Ca(v)3 T-type Ca(2+) channels with little or no effect on Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) channel inactivation kinetics , use- and state-dependence of blockade . These results suggest that T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibition only partially contributes to the anti-absence activity of ZNS antiepileptic drug . DB00991 : kinetic and dynamic profile in the treatment of pain . DB00991 ( 4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazolepropionic acid ) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) which is effective in models of inflammation , pain and pyrexia . It is effective and well tolerated in the clinical management of adult rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , osteoarthritis ( OA ) , ankylosing spondylitis , soft tissue disorders and post operative dental pain . DB00991 has a high oral bioavailability ( 95 % ) , with peak plasma concentrations at 3 to 5 hours after dosing . It is metabolised in the liver by oxidative and conjugative pathways and readily eliminated by the renal and faecal routes . DB00991 's strong analgesic qualities are particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions such as periarthritis of the shoulder , since it exhibits actions such as inhibition of P23219 and P35354 isoenzymes , inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and of metalloproteases , and modulates the endogenous cannabinoid system . This editorial addresses the accompanying paper by Barbara Heller and Rosanna Tarricone on the management of shoulder periarthritis pain , in which they studied the efficacy and safety of oxaprozin compared to the comparator drug diclofenac over a 15 day period . Both oxaprozin and diclofenac compared well in the primary study endpoint of reduction in shoulder pain . DB00991 and diclofenac were well tolerated and oxaprozin showed better improvement in shoulder function and in the mental health item of the SF-36 quality of life component . The study by Heller and Tarricone is an addition to the large number of clinical trials which demonstrate that oxaprozin has equal efficacy in comparison with standard doses of commonly used anti-rheumatic agents such as aspirin , diclofenac , ibuprofen , indomethacin etc. in several different painful musculoskeletal conditions . Growth factors expression in patients with erosive esophagitis . Although the pathogenesis and treatment of erosive esophagitis ( EE ) is well recognized , little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of mucosal healing in EE patients . In this pilot study , we enrolled typical EE patients to evaluate what kinds of growth factors and their receptors were activated in their injured esophageal mucosa . Forty endoscopically proved EE patients were consecutively enrolled . Messenger RNA expressions , which includes keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) and its receptor ( P21802 ) , epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) and its receptor ( HGFR ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 , were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Data were compared between the injured EE mucosa and their normal esophageal mucosa above EE . The mRNA expressions of P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and P35354 , but not P00533 , KGF , P21802 , P09038 , and P23219 , were significantly increased in the injured mucosa of EE patients compared with those of normal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) . The study found that P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and , P35354 are activated in the injured mucosa of EE patients ; their activation might be involved in mucosal repair and ulcer healing of EE . Effective dasatinib uptake may occur without human organic cation transporter 1 ( O15245 ) : implications for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia . We have previously shown that imatinib uptake into chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells is dependent on human organic cation transporter 1 ( O15245 ; O15245 ) , and that low O15245 expression is an important determinant of clinical outcome to imatinib treatment . We hypothesized that dasatinib might be transported differently than imatinib , possibly accounting for its favorable effects in imatinib-resistant patients . (14)C-dasatinib uptake was greater in KCL22-transfected cells with pcDNA3- O15245 plasmid ( high O15245 -expressing cells ) than in control cells ( P = .02 ) . However , hOCT inhibitors did not decrease dasatinib uptake into either control or primary cells , in contrast to their block on imatinib uptake . Dasa-tinib decreased the level of phosphorylated CrkL to 49.9 % in control and 40.3 % in high O15245 -expressing cells . Dasa-tinib efflux was investigated in confluent P08183 -transfected MDCKII cell monolayers . Both dasatinib and imatinib were transported from the basal to the apical layer , indicating that they were transported by P08183 , which was confirmed using the P08183 inhibitor PSC833 ( P = .001 and P < .001 , respectively ) . Compared with imatinib , dasatinib achieved superior intracellular levels and P11274 - P00519 suppression even in cells with low or blocked O15245 . Efflux of dasatinib and imatinib appear similar via P08183 . Dasatinib may therefore offer an advantage over imatinib in patients with low O15245 expression . Dopamine agonist-induced hypothermia and disruption of prepulse inhibition : evidence for a role of D3 receptors ? The dopamine D3/D2 receptor agonists 7-OH-DPAT , quinpirole , quinelorane , and PD128907 , the mixed dopamine agonist apomorphine , the D2 agonist bromocriptine , and the D1/D5 agonist SKF38393 were examined in models of hypothermia and prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in Wistar rats . As dopamine agonist-induced hypothermia has been proposed as a model of D3 receptor function , and dopamine agonists are known to disrupt PPI , drug potencies to induce hypothermia were established and compared with doses necessary to disrupt PPI . 7-OH-DPAT , quinpirole , quinelorane , PD128907 , and apomorphine , reduced body temperature and disrupted PPI with a similar rank order of potency ( quinelorane > quinpirole = 7-OH-DPAT > PD128907 = apomorphine ) . DB01200 and SKF38393 were ineffective in both models . In a separate study , the dopamine reuptake inhibitors cocaine and GBR 12909 had no effect on PPI . In a final set of studies , the D2/D3 antagonist raclopride blocked both 7-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia and 7-OH-DPAT-induced PPI disruption . The P08908 antagonist WAY 100,135 , and the peripheral D2-like antagonist domperidone had no effect . These findings suggest that the hypothermia and PPI disruptions seen with some of these dopamine agonists may be mediated by central D3 receptors ; however , only studies using more selective dopamine receptor ligands can definitively rule out effects at the D2 or D4 receptors . DB03419 incorporation into genomic DNA does not predict toxicity caused by chemotherapeutic inhibition of thymidylate synthase . P04818 ( TS ) is an important target of several chemotherapeutic agents , including DB00544 and raltitrexed ( DB00293 ) . During TS inhibition , TTP levels decrease with a subsequent increase in dUTP . DB03419 incorporated into the genome is removed by base excision repair ( BER ) . Thus , BER initiated by uracil DNA glycosylase ( P13051 ) activity has been hypothesized to influence the toxicity induced by TS inhibitors . In this study we created a human cell line expressing the Ugi protein inhibitor of P13051 family of UDGs , which reduces cellular P13051 activity by at least 45-fold . Genomic uracil incorporation was directly measured by mass spectrometry following treatment with TS inhibitors . Genomic uracil levels were increased over 4-fold following TS inhibition in the Ugi-expressing cells , but did not detectably increase in P13051 proficient cells . Despite the difference in genomic uracil levels , there was no difference in toxicity between the P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells to folate or nucleotide-based inhibitors of TS . Cell cycle analysis showed that P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells arrested in early S-phase and resumed replication progression during recovery from RTX treatment almost identically . The induction of gamma- P16104 was measured following TS inhibition as a measure of whether uracil excision promoted DNA double strand break formation during S-phase arrest . Although gamma- P16104 was detectable following TS inhibition , there was no difference between P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells . We therefore conclude that uracil excision initiated by P13051 does not adequately explain the toxicity caused by TS inhibition in this model . Increased angiogenesis protects against adipose hypoxia and fibrosis in metabolic disease-resistant 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( HSD1 ) -deficient mice . In obesity , rapidly expanding adipose tissue becomes hypoxic , precipitating inflammation , fibrosis , and insulin resistance . Compensatory angiogenesis may prevent these events . Mice lacking the intracellular glucocorticoid-amplifying enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11βHSD1(-/-) ) have " healthier " adipose tissue distribution and resist metabolic disease with diet-induced obesity . Here we show that adipose tissues of 11βHSD1(-/-) mice exhibit attenuated hypoxia , induction of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF-1α ) activation of the TGF-β/ P84022 /α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) signaling pathway , and fibrogenesis despite similar fat accretion with diet-induced obesity . Moreover , augmented 11βHSD1(-/-) adipose tissue angiogenesis is associated with enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ( PPARγ ) -inducible expression of the potent angiogenic factors P15692 , apelin , and angiopoietin-like protein 4 . Improved adipose angiogenesis and reduced fibrosis provide a novel mechanism whereby suppression of intracellular glucocorticoid regeneration promotes safer fat expansion with weight gain . Phosphorylation of the P81877 and P00519 proteins by the Q9UBW7 - P11362 fusion kinase seen in atypical myeloproliferative disorders as revealed by phosphopeptide-specific MS . The Q9UBW7 -fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 ( P11362 ) fusion kinase is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase associated with a specific atypical myeloproliferative disease . The chimeric protein localizes to the cytoplasm , unlike the wild type P11362 receptor kinase , and presumably inappropriately phosphorylates specific targets as part of the oncogenic signaling cascade . Other than known targets of the P11362 kinase itself , few specific targets of Q9UBW7 - P11362 have been identified . Using a genetically engineered P29320 293 cell system , we have identified proteins that are specifically phosphorylated in the presence of the fusion kinase using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and MS . Compared with 293 cells expressing exongenous wild type P11362 , Q9UBW7 - P11362 is associated with phosphorylation of several proteins including P81877 , P00519 , FLJ14235 , CALM and Q9C037 proteins . The specificity of the phosphorylation events in the P81877 and P00519 proteins , which have previously been implicated in leukemogenesis , was further confirmed independently using immunoprecipitation with protein-specific antibodies and Western blotting . The MS analysis also identified the phosphorylation events in the Q9UBW7 moiety in the chimeric protein that might be related to its function . These studies identify the intersection of several different leukemia-related pathways in the development of this myeloproliferative disorder and provide new insights into the substrates of P11362 under defined conditions . DB09079 , a triple angiokinase inhibitor , enhances cytotoxic therapy response in pancreatic cancer . Angiogenesis remains a sensible target for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) therapy . P15692 , PDGF , FGF and their receptors are expressed at high levels and correlate with poor prognosis in human PDAC . DB09079 is a triple angiokinase inhibitor that targets P17948 /2/3 , P11362 /2/3 and PDGFRα/β signaling . We investigated the antitumor activity of nintedanib alone or in combination with the cytotoxic agent gemcitabine in experimental PDAC . DB09079 inhibited proliferation of cells from multiple lineages found in PDAC , with gemcitabine enhancing inhibitory effects . DB09079 blocked PI3K/MAPK activity and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo . In a heterotopic model , net local tumor growth compared to controls ( 100 % ) was 60.8 ± 10.5 % in the gemcitabine group , -2.1 ± 9.9 % after nintedanib therapy and -12.4 ± 16 % after gemcitabine plus nintedanib therapy . Effects of therapy on intratumoral proliferation , microvessel density and apoptosis corresponded with tumor growth inhibition data . In a PDAC survival model , median animal survival after gemcitabine , nintedanib and gemcitabine plus nintedanib was 25 , 31 and 38 days , respectively , compared to 16 days in controls . The strong antitumor activity of nintedanib in experimental PDAC supports the potential of nintedanib-controlled mechanisms as targets for improved clinical PDAC therapy . Next generation molecular targeted agents for breast cancer : focus on P00533 and VEGFR pathways . Here we reviewed the recent progress of molecular targeting drugs , including trastuzumab , lapatinib , erlotinib and bevacituzumab . Fortunately , Her-2 positive cases of metastatic or relapsed cases , those with the worse prognosis , are responsive to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy . DB01259 will likely be effective against trastuzumab-resistant cases and brain metastases . Furthermore , the introduction of bevacituzumab will improve P15692 -VEGFR- associated tumor growth .
Antagonizing amyloid-β/calcium-sensing receptor signaling in human astrocytes and neurons : a key to halt Alzheimer 's disease progression ? Astrocytes ' roles in late-onset Alzheimer 's disease ( LOAD ) promotion are important , since they survive soluble or fibrillar amyloid-β peptides ( Aβs ) neurotoxic effects , undergo alterations of intracellular and intercellular Ca(2+) signaling and gliotransmitters release via the Aβ/α7-nAChR ( α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ) signaling , and overproduce/oversecrete newly synthesized Aβ42 oligomers , NO , and P15692 via the Aβ/ P41180 ( calcium-sensing receptor ) signaling . Recently , it was suggested that the NMDAR ( N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ) inhibitor nitromemantine would block the synapse-destroying effects of Aβ/α7-nAChR signaling . Yet , this and the progressive extracellular accrual and spreading of Aβ42 oligomers would be stopped well upstream by P0C0P6 2143 , an allosteric P41180 antagonist ( calcilytic ) . [ DB01257 in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ] . Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare acquired clonal of the hematopoietic stem cell due to acquired mutation of the P37287 gene . This results in the lack of two P06744 -anchored membrane proteins involved in the inhibition of complement attack , thus explaining red cells hemolysis . The development of an anti- P01031 monoclonal antibody ( eculizumab ) had profoundly modified the treatment of the the hemolytic form of the disease . Comparative effects of azimilide and ambasilide on the human ether-a-go-go-related gene ( Q12809 ) potassium channel . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effects of azimilide and ambasilide on the biophysical properties of the human-ether-a-go-go-related ( Q12809 ) channel . METHODS : Q12809 was stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO- P04264 ) cells and currents were measured using a whole cell , voltage-clamp technique . RESULTS : DB04957 had a ' dual effect ' , inhibiting current at voltage steps above -40 mV and augmenting current at -40 and -50 mV . Tail current inhibition following a step to +30 mV did not vary with temperature ( IC(50) 610 nM at 22 degrees C and 560 nM at 37 degrees C ) . The agonist effect at -50 mV was concentration-dependent and correlated with a hyperpolarizing shift in the V(1/2) of activation ( r=0.98 , P < 0.05 ) . Time constants of inactivation were faster and there was a -10 mV shift in the V(1/2) of steady state inactivation suggestive of open and inactivated state binding . By comparison , ambasilide inhibited Q12809 channels with lower potency ( IC(50) 3.6 microM ) , in a voltage- and time-dependent but frequency-independent manner ( 0.03-1 Hz ) . Ambasilide had no effect on activation or inactivation gating but prolonged both fast and slow components of deactivation consistent with unbinding from the open state . The net effect of both drugs was similar during a voltage ramp which simulated a cardiac action potential . CONCLUSIONS : Inhibition of Q12809 channels by azimilide and ambasilide exhibits a similar time and voltage-dependence . While both exhibit affinity for the open state , azimilide also binds to inactivated channels . Treatment of peripapillary choroidal neovascularization with intravitreal bevacizumab . PURPOSE : Peripapillary choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) is an uncommon condition and often shows a growth tendency towards the fovea during spontaneous progression that threatens visual acuity . Treatment of peripapillary CNV is difficult . The authors report results of intravitreal bevacizumab therapy for peripapillary CNV . METHODS : Four patients with CNV located in the temporal or superior peripapillary area received intravitreal bevacizumab injections . Ophthalmologic examinations including O75051 were performed at baseline and at 6-week intervals . DB00693 angiography was performed at baseline and depending on clinical and O75051 findings . The mean follow-up was 34+/-20 ( 22-69 ) weeks . RESULTS : The patients received an average of 3.5+/-3.1 ( 1-8 ) injections . In all patients fluorescein angiography showed inactivation of peripapillary CNV . No further increase in size was observed in any of the patients . The O75051 showed a decrease of intraretinal and subretinal fluid . No intraocular or systemic side effects were observed . CONCLUSIONS : In this series of patients , intravitreal bevacizumab appears to be efficacious . A progression of peripapillary CNV could be prevented in all patients and the lesion was successfully inactivated . Anti- P15692 treatment with bevacizumab represents a promising therapy option for peripapillary CNV . Pharmacology of the calcium sensing receptor . DB01373 sensing receptor ( P41180 ) is a G-protein couple receptor which plays a key role in calcium homeostasis in vertebrates . Its extracellular domain is sensitive to divalent cations , aminoacids and polyamines . In parathyroid glands , P41180 activation causes parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) reduction and subsequently a decrease in blood calcium concentration . In PTH-dependent disorders , e.g. primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism ( Q9HD23 ) , the need for therapeutic options other than surgery led to the synthesis of various allosteric P41180 agonists ( calcimimetics ) , such as cinacalcet . DB01012 is the only calcimimetic approved for Q9HD23 secondary to chronic kidney disease ( CDK ) , parathyroid carcinoma , and , in some countries , primary Q9HD23 . Clinical trials showed that cinacalcet reduced PTH and calcemia both in CDK and primary Q9HD23 , lowering the risk of bone fractures , surgery , and cardiovascular complications in the former patients . Long-term safety and pharmacoeconomics have to be fully tested yet . Few both in vitro and in vivo studies showed an association between Arg990Gly- P41180 polymorphism and cinacalcet sensitivity , though in patients with severe P41180 inactivating mutations the drug substantially retained its positive clinical effects . Recently , a new class of allosteric antagonists of P41180 , i.e. calcilytics , has been synthesized . Calcilytics are structurally similar to calcimimetics , but exert their effects acting on a different allosteric site . Infusion of calcilytics was followed by transient rise in PTH and calcium . One of these compounds , DB05255 , was able to increase femur BMD in post menopausal women , but with induction of mild hyperparathyroidism . In the future , calcilytics may contribute to the osteoporosis treatment choice . Effects of cytokines on P15692 expression and secretion by human first trimester trophoblast cell line . PROBLEM : The mechanism through which vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) regulation occurs at the feto-maternal interface is poorly understood . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of various cytokines on P15692 expression and secretion by trophoblast cells . METHOD OF STUDY : We investigated the effects of cytokines on P15692 expression in human first trimester trophoblast cell line by analyzing P15692 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and P15692 protein secretion by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay . RESULTS : The trophoblast cells expressed P15692 mRNA constitutively and the main subtypes were identified as VEGF121 and VEGF165 . When cultured in the presence of interferon ( IFN ) -gamma , interleukin ( IL ) - 1beta , tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , P60568 , or P22301 , P15692 mRNA expression was found to be significantly increased by IL-1beta , P01579 and P01375 but to be unaffected by P60568 and P22301 . Moreover , P15692 secretion was most significantly increased by P01579 treatment . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that IL-1beta , P01579 , and P01375 may regulate the production of P15692 in early gestational trophoblasts . Implantation of P15692 transfected preadipocytes improves vascularization of fibrin implants on the cylinder chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) model . The successful substitution or augmentation of soft tissues by implantation of three dimensional cell constructs , consisting of human preadipocytes and fibrin glue as a carrier matrix , requires a rapid and homogeneous vascularization of the whole implant in order to provide a sufficient blood supply of centrally situated cells . Previous investigations have shown that under in vivo conditions primary human preadipocytes induce vascularization of fibrin matrices by secretion of several growth factors , such as P15692 and P09038 . The current study investigates whether vascularization of implants can be improved by transplantation of preadipocytes following transfection with a P15692 -vector . Transfection was performed by electroporation with an pCMX-GFP and pCMX-VEGF165 vector . Transfection efficiency ( GFP expression ) and P15692 expression were determined in vitro by FACS analysis and P15692 immunoassay , respectively . In vivo investigations to determine the vascularization of the implants were performed on the cylinder chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) . Four million P15692 transfected cells were transferred within a fibrin matrix onto the P62158 on the 7(th) day of incubation and after 8 days the vascularization of the implant was histologically examined and evaluated by means of a computer-assisted image analysis program . Transfection of preadipocytes with the GFP vector by electroporation yielded transfection efficiencies between 12 % and 41 % of surviving cells . Results of the P15692 immunoassay demonstrated that P15692 expression was significantly higher following transfection . Investigations on the P62158 outlined a significantly higher rate of vascularization in the transfected vs. control population . Our investigations demonstrate that primary human preadipocytes can be successfully transfected by electroporation with a P15692 vector . The enhanced P15692 expression on transfected cells results in an increase of vascularization of the cell constructs on the P62158 . A novel strategy for the generation of angiostatic kringle regions from a precursor derived from plasminogen . In this study we have explored the feasibility of generating angiostatin by incorporating an endoproteolytic furin cleavage site into plasminogen to allow conversion of the precursor molecule into an angiostatic active P04264 -3 fragment . We show that secretable angiostatin can be successfully generated from cells infected with adenovirus carrying the furin-mutated plasminogen ( AdmuthPlgK3 ) . Supernatant from cells transduced with AdmuthPlagK3 inhibits tube formation and proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with an efficiency similar to that of supernatant from cells infected with adenovirus expressing kringle 1-3 of plasminogen ( AdK1-3 ) . Administration of AdmuthPlgK3 and AdK1-3 in mice results in significantly decreased endothelial cell infiltration in P15692 -embedded Matrigel plugs . Treatment with AdmuthPlgK3 and AdK1-3 exerts strong antitumoral effect in models of hepatocellular carcinoma and Lewis lung cancer . This antitumor effect was associated with decreased microvessel density in the tumors . Taken together , our data demonstrate that angiostatin endowed with strong antiangiogenic and antitumor effects can be released from a furin-mutated plasminogen acting as a precursor . This strategy may have potential to develop angiostatic anti-cancer therapies . Pharmacology of recombinant low-voltage activated calcium channels . Several types of voltage- or ligand-activated calcium channels contribute to the excitability of neuronal cells . Low-voltage-activated ( LVA ) , T-type calcium channels are characterised by relatively negative threshold of activation and therefore they can generate low-threshold spikes , which are essential for burst firing . At least three different proteins form T-type calcium current in neurons : Ca(v)3.1 , Ca(v)3.2 and Q9P0X4 . Expression of these proteins in various brain regions is complementary . Individual channel types could be distinguished by different sensitivity towards inorganic cations . This inhibition can contribute to the toxicity of some heavy metals . Selective inhibition of T-type calcium channels by organic blockers may have clinical importance in some forms of epilepsy . DB01388 inhibits the expressed Ca(v2)3.1 , Ca(v)3.2 and Q9P0X4 channels in nanomolar concentrations with Q9P0X4 channel having lowest affinity . The sensitivity of the expressed Ca(v)3.1 channel to the antiepileptic drugs , valproate and ethosuximide , is low . Ca(v)3.1 channel is moderately sensitive to phenytoin . The Ca(v)3.2 channel is sensitive to ethosuximide , amlodipine and amiloride . All three LVA calcium channels are moderately sensitive to active metabolites of methosuximide , i.e. alpha-methyl-alpha-phenylsuccinimide . Several neuroleptics inhibit all three LVA channels in clinically relevant concentrations . All three channels are also inhibited by the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide . A high affinity peptide blocker for these Ca channels is the scorpion toxin kurtoxin which inhibits the Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.2 , but not the Q9P0X4 channel in nanomolar concentrations . DB06690 selectively inhibits the Ca(v)3.2 , but not the Ca(v)3.1 channel . The Ca(v)3.2 , but not the Ca(v)3.1 channel is potentiated by stimulation of Ca(2+)/ P62158 -dependent protein kinase . Isoenzyme-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors : a whole cell assay system using the human erythroleukemic cell line HEL and the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 . NSAIDs inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid into DB03866 and Prostaglandin H2 which is catalyzed by the enzyme cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) . Two genetically distinct isoforms have been discovered , P23219 and P35354 . While P23219 is thought to account for homeostatic amounts of eicosanoids , P35354 is induced during inflammation leading to pathologic amounts of eicosanoids . Since NSAIDs inhibit both P36551 isoforms , antiinflammatory drug research has refocused to discovering P35354 inhibitors that do not inhibit P23219 . For this purpose , we have developed a whole cell assay system using the human erythroleukemic cell line HEL as a source for P23219 and the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 as a source for P35354 . Mono Mac 6 cells express high amounts of P35354 upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in the absence of any detectable P23219 protein . On the other hand , we find HEL cells to naturally express P23219 protein , but not P35354 . Testing of a panel of NSAIDs as well as some P35354 specific inhibitors showed that this assay system is suitable for identifying compounds that selectively inhibit either P23219 or P35354 . This test system offers the advantage of assessing P23219 and P35354 inhibitors within the human species , within a similar test set-up , and circumvents the need for tedious purification of either platelets or peripheral blood monocytes . Vitamin D analogues . The plethora of actions attributed to 1,25(OH)2D3 throughout the body have suggested potential therapeutic applications for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases , immune dysfunction , endocrine disorders , and metabolic bone disease . However , the potent calcemic activity of the natural vitamin D hormone has precluded its use in most cases . New vitamin D analogues are under development that display greater specificity , in most cases , by retaining the therapeutic properties of 1,25(OH)2D3 , but with lower calcemic activity . Two analogues have been approved for use in patients : calcipotriol ( DB02300 from Leo Pharmaceuticals , Copenhagen , Denmark ) for the treatment of psoriasis ; and 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D2 ( DB00910 from Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , IL ) for secondary hyperparathyroidism . Many others analogues are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of various types of cancer and osteoporosis , and for immunosuppression . The selectivity of the analogues can be attributed to the combined interactions with four proteins : the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , the serum vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) , the vitamin D-24-hydroxylase and to a newly described membrane receptor . Low DBP affinity has been shown to be responsible for the reduced calcemic actions of calcipotriol and 22-oxacalcitriol ( O75051 ) , which is being tested for secondary hyperparathyroidism . However , the low calcemic activity of other analogues , including 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D2 , involves other , as yet undefined , mechanisms . Understanding of the molecular basis for the selectivity of the vitamin D analogues will allow the design of more effective and safer vitamin D compounds for the treatment of a wide range of clinical disorders . DB06779 , a low-molecular-weight heparin , promotes angiogenesis mediated by heparin-binding P15692 in vivo . Tumors are angiogenesis dependent and vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( P15692 ) , a heparin-binding protein , is a key angiogenic factor . As chemotherapy and co-treatment with anticoagulant low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) are common in cancer patients , we investigated whether angiogenesis in vivo mediated by P15692 is modulated by metronomic-type treatment with : ( i ) the LMWH dalteparin ; ( ii ) low-dosage cytostatic epirubicin ; or ( iii ) a combination of these two drugs . Using the quantitative rat mesentery angiogenesis assay , in which angiogenesis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of very low doses of P15692 , dalteparin sodium ( Fragmin(®) ) and epirubicin ( Farmorubicin(®) ) were administered separately or in combination by continuous subcutaneous infusion at a constant rate for 14 consecutive days . DB06779 was administered at 27 , 80 , or 240 IU/kg/day , i.e. , doses that reflect the clinical usage of this drug , while epirubicin was given at the well-tolerated dosage of 0.4 mg/kg/day . While dalteparin significantly stimulated angiogenesis in an inversely dose-dependent manner , epirubicin did not significantly affect angiogenesis . However , concurrent treatment with dalteparin and epirubicin significantly inhibited angiogenesis . The effect of dalteparin is the first demonstration of a proangiogenic effect of any LMWH in vivo . The fact that co-treatment with dalteparin and epirubicin significantly inhibited angiogenesis suggests a complex drug effect . Growth factors expression in patients with erosive esophagitis . Although the pathogenesis and treatment of erosive esophagitis ( EE ) is well recognized , little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of mucosal healing in EE patients . In this pilot study , we enrolled typical EE patients to evaluate what kinds of growth factors and their receptors were activated in their injured esophageal mucosa . Forty endoscopically proved EE patients were consecutively enrolled . Messenger RNA expressions , which includes keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) and its receptor ( P21802 ) , epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) and its receptor ( HGFR ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 , were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Data were compared between the injured EE mucosa and their normal esophageal mucosa above EE . The mRNA expressions of P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and P35354 , but not P00533 , KGF , P21802 , P09038 , and P23219 , were significantly increased in the injured mucosa of EE patients compared with those of normal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) . The study found that P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and , P35354 are activated in the injured mucosa of EE patients ; their activation might be involved in mucosal repair and ulcer healing of EE . Shear stress-mediated F1/FO DB00171 synthase-dependent CO2 gas excretion from human pulmonary arteriolar endothelial cells . We studied the physiological role of flow through pulmonary arterioles in CO(2) gas exchange . We established human pulmonary arteriolar endothelial cells ( HPAoEC ) . The cells demonstrated marked immunocytochemical staining of P16284 , P15692 R2 , P12821 -1 , and CA type IV on their cell surface . Ten seconds shear stress stimulation caused the co-release of H(+) and DB00171 via the activation of F(1)/F(O) DB00171 synthase on the HPAoEC . F(1)/F(O) DB00171 synthase was immunocytochemically observed on the cell surface of non-permeabilized HPAoEC . In the shear stress-loaded HPAoEC culture media supernatant , ATPase activity increased in a time-dependent manner . The HPAoEC were strongly stained for P49961 , which partially co-localized with purinergic P47900 . The purinergic P47900 receptor agonist UTP ( 10(-6) M ) significantly potentiated the shear stress-induced increase in ATPase activity in the culture medium supernatant . Ten seconds shear stress stimulation also produced stress strength-dependent CO(2) gas excretion from the HPAoEC , which was significantly reduced by the inhibition of F(1)/F(O) DB00171 synthase or CA IV on the endothelial cell ( EC ) surface . In conclusion , we have proposed a new concept of CO(2) exchange in the human lung , flow-mediated F(1)/F(O) DB00171 synthase-dependent H(+) secretion , resulting in the facilitation of a dehydration reaction involving HCO3(-) in plasma and the excretion of CO(2) gas from arteriolar ECs . ADP receptors -- targets for developing antithrombotic agents . Platelet P2 receptors -- P47900 , Q9H244 , and P51575 -- constitute the means by which adenine nucleotides can activate platelets . Coactivation of the Galphaq-coupled P47900 and Galphai2-coupled Q9H244 receptors is necessary for ADP-mediated platelet activation , which forms the basis of using P2 antagonists as antithrombotic drugs . P47900 receptor antagonists inhibit platelet activation , while P47900 knockout mice show longer bleeding times than normal mice but few other problems ; however , its ubiquitous expression in other tissues renders P47900 questionable as an antithrombotic target . The Q9H244 receptor is expressed nearly exclusively in platelets and brain , making it an attractive antithrombotic target . Antagonists for the Q9H244 receptor have been developed that either require metabolic activation to covalently inhibit Q9H244 and are irreversible , or simply are competitive in nature and thus reversible . DB00208 and clopidogrel are irreversible Q9H244 antagonists and have been repeatedly proven as clinical antithrombotic agents . In addition , a recently reported Q9H244 antagonist , CS-747 , shows promise as a future antithrombotic drug . The AR-C series of compounds represent reversible Q9H244 antagonists and have been used extensively to characterize the function of Q9H244 in platelets . Clinical studies show that AR-C69931MX is as effective as clopidogrel ; furthermore , the combination of AR-C69931MX ( cangrelor ) and clopidogrel confers greater antagonism of Q9H244 than either antagonist alone . The P51575 receptor is a calcium channel that functions to potentiate agonist-induced platelet shape change , and its inhibition or loss has little if any effect on hemostasis . A combination of P47900 and Q9H244 antagonists may represent an additional course of antithrombotic treatment . Angiogenic and inflammatory factor expressions in cutaneomeningospinal angiomatosis ( Cobb 's syndrome ) : case report . We report on a case of cervical cutaneomeningospinal angiomatosis ( Cobb 's syndrome ) , a rare somatic disorder , characterized by vascular abnormalities of the spinal cord , with a triad of associated vascular skin , muscle , bone , and dura involvement at the same somite . This case follows an 18-year-old male patient presenting with left extremity weakness and back cervical pain . Magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) revealed a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) at the P01024 - P01031 level . Cobb 's syndrome was diagnosed by coexistence of cutaneous naevi in a dermatomal pattern and neurological signs of a spinal cord lesion together with cervical Q9BWK5 and angiography . The patient underwent a combination of staged endovascular embolization and microsurgical resection . Multiple biopsies of the mass including the skin , muscle , dura , and spinal cord at the same somite revealed that the lesions had a similar pathology . Post-operative immunohistochemical characterizations on specimen included CD31 , smooth muscle actin ( SMA ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and matrix metalloproteinase ( P14780 ) . The unique associations of somatic and spinal cord lesion as well as angiogenic and inflammatory factor expressions in all specimens are reported . Current and emerging biologics for ulcerative colitis . Conventional medical treatment for ulcerative colitis can have limited efficacy or severe adverse reactions requiring additional treatment or colectomy . Hence , different biological agents that target specific immunological pathways are be-ing investigated for treating ulcerative colitis . Anti-tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) agents were the first biologics to be used for treating inflammatory bowel disease . For example , infliximab and adalimumab , which are anti- P01375 agents , are be-ing used for treating ulcerative colitis . Recently , DB06674 , another anti- P01375 agent , and vedolizumab , an anti-adhesion therapy , have been approved for ulcerative colitis by the U.S . Food and Drug Administration . In addition , new medications such as tofacitinib , a Janus kinase inhibitor , and etrolizumab , another anti-adhesion therapy , are emerging as therapeutic agents . Therefore , there is a need for further studies to select appropriate patient groups for these biologics and to improve the outcomes of ulcerative colitis treatment through appropriate medical usage . DB09559 , a fully human IgG1 mAb directed against the P00533 for the potential treatment of cancer . DB09559 ( DB05774 ) , under development by ImClone Systems in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb , is a fully human IgG1 mAb targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , for the potential intravenous treatment of cancer , in particular NSCLC . In vitro studies demonstrate that necitumumab inhibits downstream targets in the P00533 pathway ( eg , MAPK ) , which are important for cellular proliferation , differentiation , invasion and metastasis . Furthermore , because necitumumab is an IgG1 construct , it has the potential to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells . Preclinical studies indicated that the antitumor activity of necitumumab is either comparable with or superior to that of ImClone 's chimeric anti- P00533 mAb cetuximab . In a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies , necitumumab displayed nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior . The toxicity profile of necitumumab is acceptable , with skin toxicity being the most frequently reported adverse event in the phase I and II clinical trials conducted to date . Preliminary data from a phase II clinical trial of necitumumab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced colon cancer are promising . Success in the ongoing phase III clinical trials in patients with advanced NSCLC would lead to necitumumab becoming a valuable addition to future therapeutic strategies in oncology .
Therapeutic implications of variable expression of P31358 on clonal cytotoxic T cells in CD8+ large granular lymphocyte leukemia . BACKGROUND : T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia is a clonal proliferation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes which often results in severe cytopenia . Current treatment options favor chronic immunosuppression . DB00087 , a humanized monoclonal antibody against glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored P31358 , is approved for patients refractory to therapy in other lymphoid malignancies . DESIGN AND METHODS : We retrospectively examined treatment outcomes in 59 patients with CD8+ T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia , 41 of whom required therapy . Eight patients with severe refractory cytopenia despite multiple treatment regimens had been treated with subcutaneous alemtuzumab as salvage therapy . Flow cytometry was used to monitor expression of glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored P31358 , P08174 , and P13987 as well as to characterize T-cell clonal expansions by T-cell receptor variable beta-chain ( Vbeta ) repertoire . RESULTS : Analysis of the effects of alemtuzumab revealed remissions with restoration of platelets in one of one patient , red blood cell transfusion independence in three of five patients and improvement of neutropenia in one of three , resulting in an overall response rate of 50 % ( 4/8 patients ) . Clonal large granular lymphocytes exhibited decreased P31358 expression post-therapy in patients refractory to treatment . Samples of large granular lymphocytes collected prior to therapy also unexpectedly had a significant proportion of P31358 -negative cells while a healthy control population had no such P31358 deficiency ( p=0.026 ) . CONCLUSIONS : While alemtuzumab may be highly effective in large granular lymphocytic leukemia , prospective serial monitoring for the presence of P31358 -deficient clonal cytotoxic T-lymphocytes should be a component of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of this drug . P31358 deficiency may explain lack of response to alemtuzumab , and such therapy may confer a survival advantage to glycophosphatidylinositol-negative clonal cytotoxic T-lymphocytes . Ex vivo expansion and long-term hematopoietic reconstitution ability of sorted P28906 + P13987 + cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . Autologous bone marrow transplantation ( ABMT ) for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) remains difficult so far . To expand residual normal P28906 (+) P13987 (+) cells isolated from patients with PNH and observe the long-term hematopoietic reconstruction ability of the expanded cells both ex vivo and in vivo , P28906 (+) P13987 (+) cells from 13 PNH patients and P28906 (+) cells from 11 normal controls were separated from bone marrow mononuclear cells first by immunomagnetic microbeads and then by flow cytometry autoclone sorting . The cells were then cultivated under different conditions . The long-term hematopoietic supporting ability of expanded P28906 (+) P13987 (+) cells was evaluated by long-term culture in semi-solid medium in vitro and long-term engraftment in irradiated severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice in vivo . The best combination of hematopoietic growth factors for ex vivo expansion was P21583 + P08700 + P05231 + FL + Tpo + Epo . The most suitable time for harvest was on day 7 . P28906 (+) P13987 (+) PNH cells retained strong colony-forming capacity even after expansion . The survival rate , complete blood cell count recovery on day 90 , and human P08575 expression in different organs were similar between the irradiated SCID mice transplanted with expanded P28906 (+) P13987 (+) PNH cells and those with normal P28906 (+) cells ( P > 0.05 ) both in primary and secondary transplantation . These data provided a new potential way of managing PNH with ABMT . Purification and characterization of heterogeneous pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell populations expressing high levels of c-kit receptor . Mouse pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells ( PHSC ) were fractionated based on size and density using counterflow centrifugal elutriation ( CCE ) . These heterogeneous PHSC populations were further enriched by subtraction of cells with lineage-specific markers ( Lin- ) followed by positive sorting for c-kit expression . The cells were characterized for their functional and biochemical properties . We defined a subpopulation of c-kit-positive cells that expressed high numbers of c-kit receptors ( c-kitBR ) . One hundred c-kitBR cells from either low- or higher-density fractions were sufficient to repopulate the lymphohematopoietic system in WBB6F1-W/Wv ( W/Wv ) recipients , whereas no PHSC were found in cells with low ( c-kitDULL ) or no ( c-kitNEG ) c-kit expression . Lin- c-kitBR cells were separated into RhoDULL and RhoBR subsets based on their ability to efflux rhodamine 123 ( Rho ) . The PHSC were concentrated in Lin- c-kitBR RhoDULL cells and the number of Lin- c-kitBR RhoBR cells correlated directly with the number of day 12 colony-forming unit-spleen ( CFU- P28222 ) in each fraction . We were not able to enrich further for PHSC using monoclonal antibodies to the cell-surface markers AA4.1 or P01730 , which have been used by others to isolate PHSC . The small , low-density Lin- c-kitBR subset contained PHSC and few CFU- P28222 . This enabled us to assay PHSC for expression of the flk-2 gene , which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor present on fetal liver PHSC . Purified RNA from the low-density Lin- c-kitBR subset did not contain flk-2 mRNA . We suggest that AA4.1 , P01730 and flk-2 are expressed as stage-specific markers on PHSC in cell cycle . Activation of T cells via P08174 : recruitment of early components of the CD3-TCR pathway is required for P60568 secretion . It was previously reported that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( P06744 ) -anchored P08174 molecule provides a co-stimulatory signal for T lymphocytes and is constitutively associated with the Src-related kinase p56lck . The present studies were undertaken to clarify the mechanism of action of P08174 in T cells . We describe the failure of cross-linking of P08174 alone to induce both the elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration and the tyrosine phosphorylation of P98160 -gamma in CD3+ Jurkat cells . By contrast , it is sufficient to induce the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on p56lck , the TCR-zeta chain as well as Q7Z2W4 -70 . Surprisingly , the observed TCR-zeta and Q7Z2W4 -70 tyrosine phosphorylations appear delayed compared to stimulation via CD3 . DB01373 ionophore A23187 in combination with cross-linked P08174 mAb initially caused an acceleration in the kinetic of these two phosphorylation events , followed by P60568 secretion . Furthermore , transfection of the cytoplasmic domain of TCR-zeta in CD3- Jurkat cells , using a CD16-zeta chimera , demonstrates that P08174 -mediated T-cell activation depends on the expression of this chain of the CD3-TCR complex . P04150 antagonism disrupts the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories in rats . Reconsolidation is the process whereby consolidated memories are destabilized upon retrieval and restabilized to persist for later use . Although the neurobiology of the reconsolidation of both appetitive and aversive memories has been intensively investigated , reconsolidation of memories of physiologically relevant social rewards has received little attention . Social play , the most characteristic social behaviour displayed by young mammals , is highly rewarding , illustrated by the fact that it can induce conditioned place preference ( CPP ) . Here , we investigated the role of signalling mechanisms implicated in memory processes , including reconsolidation , namely glucocorticoid , mineralocorticoid , DB01221 glutamatergic and P21554 cannabinoid receptors , in the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP in rats . Systemic treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone before , but not immediately after , retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP . DB00834 did not affect social play-induced CPP in the absence of memory retrieval . Treatment with the DB01221 receptor antagonist MK-801 modestly affected the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP . However , the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP was not affected by treatment with the mineralocorticoid and P21554 cannabinoid receptor antagonists spironolactone and rimonabant , respectively . We conclude that glucocorticoid neurotransmission mediates the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories in rats . These data indicate that the neural mechanisms of the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories only partially overlap with those underlying the reconsolidation of other reward-related memories . [ Endometrial cancer in young women -- clinical and molecular aspects ] . OBJECTIVES : The aim the study was to compare two groups of endometrial cancer patients ( below and above 45 years of age ) in the aspect of clinicopathological and molecular data . MATERIAL AND METHODS : The study encompassed 456 primary tumour samples retrospectively collected from a cohort of endometrial cancer patients , primarily treated by surgery Molecular analysis covered : copy number variations of 10 genes ( P11388 , P00533 , P04626 , P21860 , Q15303 , MYC , P24385 , P03372 , P42336 , O60216 ) analyzed by quantitative PCR ; mRNA expression of 6 genes ( Q13296 , RAD27 , Q01196 , O95863 , O43623 , O43490 ) analyzed with the use of reverse transcription quantitative PCR ; protein expression analysis of 8 markers ( P06401 , P03372 ; P00533 , P04626 , P21860 , Q15303 , P11388 , pAKT1 ) performed with the use of immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : The younger group of patients was characterized by less frequent hypertension ( p < 0.00007 ) , less frequent myometrial infiltration ( p=0.002 ) and longer overall survival ( p=0.003 ) . Apart from O60216 gene aberrations , which were more frequent in younger patients ( p=0.02 ) , the study revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups . CONCLUSIONS : The study showed no molecular differences in the profile of younger and older endometrial cancer patients . Data on both the prognostic and predictive significance of O60216 in endometrial cancer are still insufficient . The clinical profile of younger patients with endometrial carcinoma was slightly better when compared to elderly patients . Younger patients were characterized by longer overall survival . A mechanistic rationale for combining alemtuzumab and rituximab in the treatment of ALL . B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) may express P31358 and P11836 . DB00087 ( ALM ) and rituximab ( RTX ) are therapeutic antibodies directed against P31358 and P11836 , respectively , but showed limited activity against ALL in clinical trials . The mechanisms for the impaired responses remained unclear . We studied expression of P31358 and P11836 on ALL cells and found that most cases coexpressed P31358 and P11836 . However , distinct P31358 -negative ( P31358 (-) ) subpopulations were detected in most cases as the result of defective glycophosphatidyl-inositol anchoring . Although ALM efficiently eradicated P31358 -positive ( P31358 (+) ) cells in NOD/scid mice engrafted with primary human ALL , P31358 (-) subclones escaped therapy . In the same model , RTX showed limited activity resulting from occurrence of P11836 down-modulation . However , P31358 (-) cells concurrently lacked the glycophosphatidyl-inositol-anchored complement regulators P08174 and P13987 and showed increased susceptibility to RTX-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro . At the same time , ALM was shown to inhibit down-modulation of P11836 in response to RTX by depleting the trogocytic capacity of phagocytic cells . Probably because of these complementary mechanisms , combined administration of ALM and RTX induced complete responses in vivo . Based on these data , we propose a mechanistic rationale for combined application of RTX and ALM in ALL . Real life experience with alemtuzumab treatment of patients with lower-risk P43034 and a hypocellular bone marrow . Immunosuppressive therapy is a therapeutic option for selected low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) patients . Besides standard treatment protocols that include ATG and Q13216 , the humanized P31358 antibody alemtuzumab has been shown to have efficacy in P43034 treatment . We report our experience with alemtuzumab in nine P43034 RCMD patients . All patients had a hypocellular bone marrow with a blast count < 5 % and were classified as intermediate-1 according to the IPSS . We found a response in five patients ( 60 % ) ; three patients achieved a complete remission 3 and 6 months after the treatment with alemtuzumab , and two patients showed a haematological improvement . DB00087 was administered in a 10-mg dosage for 10 days . Treatment was well tolerated , and no severe side effects were observed . We could confirm the finding that the alemtuzumab is effective and save selected P43034 patients . Due to the promising results , further studies , especially with regard to long-term survival and risk of leucemic progression should be initiated . Immunotherapy of murine leukemia following non-myeloablative conditioning with naïve or G- P04141 mobilized blood or bone marrow stem cells . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) is the treatment of choice for a large number of hematologic malignancies . Its major advantage over conventional chemotherapy lies in the graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effects mediated by allo- or tumor-reactive donor lymphocytes given in the course of P09683 or post transplantation as donor lymphocyte infusions ( DLI ) . The benefits of cell-mediated immunotherapy over myeloablative radiochemotherapy have also made it possible to reduce the intensity of conditioning regimens . Mobilized peripheral blood has proved preferable to bone marrow ( BM ) as a source of stem cells for transplantation , since it provides a larger number of stem cells on the one hand and immunologically competent lymphocytes on the other . The use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) , which is necessary to mobilize and increase the number of stem cells , may down-regulate the GVL effect by suppression of donor effector T lymphocytes by inducing Th1 --> Th2 cytokine switch . It has previously been shown that GVL effects may be amplified by both in vivo and in vitro activation of donor lymphocytes with human recombinant interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) . Our studies using a leukemic murine model prepared for transplantation with low intensity conditioning prior to infusion of G- P04141 -mobilized peripheral blood stem cells ( PBSC ) have demonstrated that mobilization of blood cells with G- P04141 and in vivo treatment with rIL-2 following low-intensity conditioning enhances the GVL effects and prolongs survival of recipients inoculated with P24385 . Activation of donor lymphocytes with rIL-2 may thus be useful for amplifying GVL effects following mobilization with DB00099 . Identification of campath-1 ( P31358 ) as novel drug target in neoplastic stem cells in 5q-patients with P43034 and AML . PURPOSE : The P31358 -targeted antibody alemtuzumab induces major clinical responses in a group of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) . The mechanism underlying this drug effect remains unknown . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We asked whether neoplastic stem cells ( NSC ) in patients with P43034 ( n = 29 ) or acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ; n = 62 ) express P31358 . RESULTS : As assessed by flow cytometry , P31358 was found to be expressed on NSC-enriched P28906 (+)/ P28907 (-) cells in 8/11 patients with P43034 and isolated del(5q) . In most other patients with P43034 , P31358 was weakly expressed or not detectable on NSC . In AML , P28906 (+)/ P28907 (-) cells displayed P31358 in 23/62 patients , including four with complex karyotype and del(5q) and one with del(5q) and t(1;17;X) . In quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) analyses , purified NSC obtained from del(5q) patients expressed P31358 mRNA . We were also able to show that P31358 mRNA levels correlate with EVI1 expression and that P01111 induces the expression of P31358 in AML cells . The P31358 -targeting drug alemtuzumab , was found to induce complement-dependent lysis of P28906 (+)/ P28907 (-)/ P31358 (+) NSC , but did not induce lysis in P31358 (-) NSC . DB00087 also suppressed engraftment of P31358 (+) NSC in NSG mice . Finally , P31358 expression on NSC was found to correlate with a poor survival in patients with P43034 and AML . CONCLUSIONS : The cell surface target Campath-1 ( P31358 ) is expressed on NSC in a group of patients with P43034 and AML . P31358 is a novel prognostic NSC marker and a potential NSC target in a subset of patients with P43034 and AML , which may have clinical implications and may explain clinical effects produced by alemtuzumab in these patients . Cytoplasmic and nuclear estrogen binding capacity in the rat uterus during treatment with danazol and testosterone . DB01406 , testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) were tested as competitors for estrogen receptors on immature rat uterus cytosol . No competitive binding could be demonstrated for any of these steroids . After that , prepubertal Wistar rats were exposed to danazol , testosterone or propylene glycol ( control ) for 3 days or 17 days . After the appropriate exposure to medication , the animals were killed . Both danazol and testosterone appeared to be uterotropic after 3 days of treatment , although the increase in the uterine weight was significant only in the danazol-treated group ( p less than 0.05 ) . This effect was lost after 17 days of treatment . P03372 binding assays were done on the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of the homogenized uterine tissue of each group . The estrogen binding capacity of cytosols was increased in both the danazol ( p less than 0.05 ) and the testosterone ( p less than 0.01 ) groups after 3 days of treatment . A parallel increase was found in the nuclear fraction of both groups . After 17 days of treatment , the comparison between the 3 groups showed no differences in the cytosolic or nuclear estrogen binding capacity . The information provided by this study suggests that some effects of danazol may be due to an androgenic action and that may be associated to increases in the free fraction of testosterone . Inflammatory protein serum amyloid A1 marks a subset of conventional renal cell carcinomas with fatal outcome . BACKGROUND : Conventional renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) is the most common renal cancer . As the metastatic conventional RCC is practically incurable , there is a need for markers to estimate the tumour aggressiveness . OBJECTIVE : To identify and characterise new marker(s) associated with the poor prognosis of conventional RCC . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : RNA from 24 conventional RCCs was analysed for global gene expression by Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays . Tissue microarrays containing 224 renal tumours including 87 conventional RCCs were used for immunohistochemistry . Cell lines Q92769 , HD48 , HA344 and HA465 established in our laboratory were used for invasion assay and zymography . MEASUREMENTS : Serum amyloid A 1 ( P0DJI8 ) was found to be upregulated in conventional RCCs and it has been analysed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on TMAs to establish the correlation between P0DJI8 protein expression and patient survival by uni and multivariate analysis . The effect of P0DJI8 on tumour cell behaviour in vitro has also been examined by invasion assay and zymography . RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS : P0DJI8 RNA is expressed in conventional RCC samples of patients with poor prognosis . Immunohistochemistry of 72 conventional RCCs with a 5 yr follow up showed a correlation between P0DJI8 expression and the clinical outcome of disease . Stimulation of conventional RCC cell lines with recombinant P0DJI8 increased the expression of metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 and the invasive potential of tumour cells . Limitation of the study is a relatively small number ( 72 ) of patients having follow up . CONCLUSION : P0DJI8 seems to be a useful marker to estimate the prognosis of conventional RCCs . CD8 T cells and P12830 in host responses against oropharyngeal candidiasis . BACKGROUND : Oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) is the most common oral infection in HIV(+) persons . Previous studies suggest a role for CD8(+) T cells against OPC when P01730 (+) T cells are lost , but enhanced susceptibility to infection occurs when CD8(+) T-cell migration is inhibited by reduced tissue P12830 . OBJECTIVE : To conduct a longitudinal study of tissue CD8(+) T-cells and P12830 expression before , during , and after the episodes of OPC . METHODS : Oral fungal burden was monitored and tissue was evaluated for CD8(+) T cells and P12830 over a 1-year period in HIV(+) persons with a history of , or an acute episode of , OPC . RESULTS : While longitudinal analyses precluded formal interpretations , point prevalence analyses of the data set revealed that when patients experiencing OPC were successfully treated , tissue P12830 expression was similar to that in patients who had not experienced OPC , and higher numbers of CD8(+) T cells were distributed throughout OPC(-) tissue under normal expression of P12830 . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that ( 1 ) reduction in tissue P12830 expression in patients with OPC(+) is not permanent , and ( 2 ) high numbers of CD8(+) T cells can be distributed throughout OPC(-) tissue under normal P12830 expression . Together , these results extend our previous studies and continue to support a role for CD8(+) T cells in host defense against OPC . Quantifying Lipari-Szabo modelfree parameters from 13CO NMR relaxation experiments . It is proposed to obtain effective Lipari-Szabo order parameters and local correlation times for relaxation vectors of protein (13)CO nuclei by carrying out a (13)CO-R(1) auto relaxation experiment , a transverse (13)CO Q13216 /13CO-13Calpha Q13216 /dipolar cross correlation and a transverse (13)CO Q13216 /(13)CO-(15)N Q13216 /dipolar cross correlation experiment . Given the global rotational correlation time from (15)N relaxation experiments , a new program COMFORD ( CO-Modelfree Fitting Of Relaxation Data ) is presented to fit the (13)CO data to an effective order parameter S2CO , an effective local correlation time and the orientation of the Q13216 tensor with respect to the molecular frame . It is shown that the effective S2CO is least sensitive to rotational fluctuations about an imaginary Calpha-Calpha axis and most sensitive to rotational fluctuations about an imaginary axis parallel to the NH bond direction . As such , the Calpha-Calpha information is fully complementary to the (15)N relaxation order parameter , which is least sensitive to fluctuations about the NH axis and most sensitive to fluctuations about the Calpha-Calpha axis . The new paradigm is applied on data of Ca(2+) saturated P62158 , and on available literature data for Ubiquitin . Our data indicate that the S2CO order parameters rapport on slower , and sometimes different , motions than the (15)N relaxation order parameters . The CO local correlation times correlate well with the calmodulin 's secondary structure . Effect of canagliflozin on renal threshold for glucose , glycemia , and body weight in normal and diabetic animal models . BACKGROUND : DB08907 is a sodium glucose co-transporter ( SGLT ) 2 inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . METHODS : (14)C-alpha-methylglucoside uptake in Chinese hamster ovary-K cells expressing human , rat , or mouse SGLT2 or P13866 ; (3)H-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in Q9BTT4 myoblasts ; and 2-electrode voltage clamp recording of oocytes expressing human SGLT3 were analyzed . Graded glucose infusions were performed to determine rate of urinary glucose excretion ( UGE ) at different blood glucose ( BG ) concentrations and the renal threshold for glucose excretion ( RT(G) ) in vehicle or canagliflozin-treated Zucker diabetic fatty ( ZDF ) rats . This study aimed to characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of canagliflozin in vitro and in preclinical models of T2DM and obesity . RESULTS : Treatment with canagliflozin 1 mg/kg lowered RT(G) from 415±12 mg/dl to 94±10 mg/dl in ZDF rats while maintaining a threshold relationship between BG and UGE with virtually no UGE observed when BG was below RT(G) . DB08907 dose-dependently decreased BG concentrations in db/db mice treated acutely . In ZDF rats treated for 4 weeks , canagliflozin decreased glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and improved measures of insulin secretion . In obese animal models , canagliflozin increased UGE and decreased BG , body weight gain , epididymal fat , liver weight , and the respiratory exchange ratio . CONCLUSIONS : DB08907 lowered RT(G) and increased UGE , improved glycemic control and beta-cell function in rodent models of T2DM , and reduced body weight gain in rodent models of obesity . DB00087 induction and steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression in pancreas transplantation . DB00087 is a humanized anti- P31358 antibody that depletes lymphocytes and has been increasingly used as induction agent in transplantation . The impact of alemtuzumab induction immunosuppression in pancreas transplantation was evaluated , with particular reference to steroid avoidance in maintenance . A total of 100 patients who received 102 pancreas transplants ( 83 simultaneous kidney-pancreas [ SPK ] , 15 pancreas after kidney transplantation [ PAK ] and 4 pancreas transplant alone [ P03951 ] ) were included . All patients received two doses of 30-mg alemtuzumab i.v. with tacrolimus ( trough level 8-12 ng/mL ) and mycophenolate mofetil ( DB00688 ,1g/day ) with no maintenance steroids . This analysis included 62 male and 38 female recipients , with mean ( +/-SD ) age of 42 ( +/-7.6 ) years . Median follow-up was 17 months ( range 8-41 months ) . One-year patient , pancreas and kidney graft survival ( actuarial ) was 97 % , 89 % and 94 % , respectively . Overall incidence of rejection was 25 % . Side effects of alemtuzumab administration included thrombocytopenia ( 14 % ) , pulmonary edema ( 2 % ) and rash ( 1 % ) . Twenty-five percent required reoperations ( 12 % for bleeding ) . Infectious complications included Cytomegalovirus ( CMV,6.8 % ) BK viruria ( 3.8 % ) , fungal infections ( 4 % ) , primary varicella ( 1 % ) and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLD,1 % ) . Eighty-three percent did not require any steroids posttransplant . These results indicate that alemtuzumab is safe and enables pancreas transplantation to be carried out without maintenance steroids in 83 % of cases and acceptable rejection rate . No significant association between genetic variants in 7 candidate genes and response to methylphenidate treatment in adult patients with ADHD . Results from pharmacogenetic investigations of methylphenidate ( DB00422 ) response in patients with ADHD are still inconsistent , especially among adults . This study investigates the role of genetic variants ( P31645 , P28222 , Q8IWU9 , P09172 , P21917 , P21964 , and P60880 ) in the response to DB00422 in a sample of 164 adults . Genes were chosen owing to previous evidence for an influence in ADHD susceptibility . No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between DB00422 responders and nonresponders were detected . In conclusion , our findings do not support an effect of these genes in the pharmacogenetics of DB00422 among adults with ADHD . Chemoimmunotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia . ALL blast cells express a variety of specific antigens e.g. P15391 , P11836 , P20273 , P20138 , and P31358 , which serve as targets for Monoclonal Antibodies ( MoAbs ) . So far , the most experience is available for anti- P11836 ( rituximab ) , which has been combined with chemotherapy for treatment of mature B-ALL/Burkitt 's lymphoma . Studies with rituximab have also been completed in B-precursor ALL . Another antigen , P15391 , is of great interest due to a very high rate of expression in ALL . It can be targeted by a bispecific monoclonal antibody , DB09052 , directed against P15391 and CD3 . Smaller studies or case reports are also available for the anti P31358 antibody ( DB00087 ) , for anti P20273 ( DB04958 ) or anti P20138 ( Gemtuzumab ) . Available data demonstrate that MoAb therapy in ALL is a highly promising targeted treatment . However , several details for an optimal treatment approach e.g. the required level of antigen expression , timing , schedule , dosage and stage of disease still need to be defined . Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab : no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion . BACKGROUND : DB00087 is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against P31358 , a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes , monocytes and NK cells . Its use results in a profound decrease in P01730 positive T lymphocytes . DB00087 is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers . We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections , particularly those previously associated with decrease in P01730 positive T lymphocytes . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Fifteen percent ( 69/449 ) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection . However , no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae , Listeria monocytogenes , non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex . Fungaemia was rare , occurring in 1.5 % of patients . The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus ( 21 episodes ) , coagulase negative Staphylococcus ( 14 episodes ) , Klebsiella pneumoniae ( 12 episodes ) , Enterococcus faecium ( 11 episodes ) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 10 episodes ) , Enterococcus faecalis ( 9 episodes ) and Escherichia coli ( 7 episodes ) . DISCUSSION : We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound P01730 positive T lymphocyte depletion , alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of P01730 cell depletion , such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome . Long-term follow-up of symptomatic patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia treated with the anti- P31358 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab . P31358 is expressed on malignant cells in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ( P06858 ) , including IgM-secreting Waldenström macroglobulinemia ( WM ) . We examined the activity of alemtuzumab in 28 symptomatic P06858 ( 27 IgM and 1 IgA ) patients . The median prior number of therapies for these patients was 2 ( range , 0-5 ) and 43 % had refractory disease . Patients received alemtuzumab at 30 mg IV 3 times weekly for up to 12 weeks after test dosing , and also received hydrocortisone , acyclovir , and Bactrim or equivalent prophylaxis . Patients had a complete response ( n = 1 ) , a partial response ( n = 9 ) , or a MR ( n = 11 ) for an overall and major response rate of 75 % and 36 % , respectively . Median serum Ig decreased from 3510 to 1460 mg/dL ( P < .001 at best response ) . With a median follow-up of 64 months , the median time to progression was 14.5 months . Hematologic and infectious complications , including CMV reactivation , were more common in previously treated patients and were indirectly associated with 3 deaths . Long-term follow-up revealed late-onset autoimmune thrombocytopenia ( AITP ) in 4 patients at a median of 13.6 months after therapy , which contributed to 1 death . DB00087 is an active therapy in patients with P06858 , but short- and long-term toxicities need to be carefully weighed against other available treatment options . Late AITP is a newly recognized complication of alemtuzumab in this patient population . This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00142181 . [ Cell cycle analysis of endometrial cancer cells in vitro treated with growth factor and steroid hormone ] . The aim of this study was to overtake the mechanism of the control system in endometrial cancer cell line in vitro . Ishikawa cell ( IK cell ) and O14777 -1 cell ( O14777 cell ) derived from endometrial cancers were cultured with serum free medium ( SFM-101 ) . IK cell possessed P03372 ( ER ) , P06401 ( PR ) , Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) . O14777 cell had PR , P01133 , and P00533 , however O14777 cell did not keep ER . P01133 stimulated the growth of IK cell , but the growth of O14777 cell was not stimulated by P01133 . S phase cells were increased by P01133 in IK cell , but were not increased by P01133 in O14777 cell . The growth of IK cell was stimulated significantly by P01133 and Estradiol-17 beta ( E2 ) + P01133 than control . However , E2+ P01133 did not stimulate the growth of IK cell than P01133 significantly . DB01406 ( D ) and D+ P01133 inhibited the growth of IK cell significantly than control . S phase cells were decreased by the treatment of D and D+ P01133 . From our results , P01133 stimulated the growth of ER positive endometrial cancer cell , but P01133 did not stimulate ER negative endometrial cancer cell . E2+ P01133 and P01133 stimulated the growth of IK cell as a same . However , D inhibited the growth of IK cell that was stimulated by P01133 . The Mek1 phosphorylation cascade plays a role in meiotic recombination of Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Mek1 is a Chk2/Rad53/Cds1-related protein kinase that is required for proper meiotic progression of Schizosaccharomyces pombe . However , the molecular mechanisms of Mek1 regulation and Mek1 phosphorylation targets are unclear . Here , we report that Mek1 is phosphorylated at serine-12 ( P28222 ) , Q92748 and threonine-15 ( T15 ) by Rad3 ( ATR ) and/or Tel1 ( Q13315 ) kinases that are activated by meiotic programmed double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . Mutations of these sites by alanine replacement caused abnormal meiotic progression and recombination rates . Phosphorylation of these sites triggers autophosphorylation of Mek1 ; indeed , alanine replacement mutations of Mek1-T318 and -T322 residues in the activation loop of Mek1 reduced Mek1 kinase activity and meiotic recombination rates . Substrates of Mek1 include Mus81-T275 , Rdh54- Q8NHM4 and Rdh54-T673 . Mus81-T275 is known to regulate the Mus81 function in DNA cleavage , whereas Rdh54-T6A/T673A mutant cells showed abnormal meiotic recombination . Taken together , we conclude that the phosphorylation of Mek1 by Rad3 or Tel1 , Mek1 autophosphorylation and Mus81 or Rdh54 phosphorylation by Mek1 regulate meiotic progression in S. pombe . P04150 and histone deacetylase-2 mediate dexamethasone-induced repression of P98088 gene expression . Airway occlusion in obstructive airway diseases is caused in part by the overproduction of secretory mucin glycoproteins through the up-regulation of mucin ( MUC ) genes by inflammatory mediators . Some pharmacological agents , including the glucocorticoid dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) , repress mucin concentrations in lung epithelial cancer cells . Here , we show that DB00514 reduces the expression of P98088 , a major airway mucin gene , in primary differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial ( NHBE ) cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner , and that the DB00514 -induced repression is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and two glucocorticoid response elements ( GREs ) in the P98088 promoter . The pre-exposure of cells to DB00834 , a GR antagonist , and mutations in either the GRE3 or GRE5 cis-sites abolished the DB00514 -induced repression . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays showed a rapid temporal recruitment of GR to the GRE3 and GRE5 cis-elements in the P98088 promoter in NHBE and in A549 cells . Immunofluorescence showed nuclear colocalization of GR and histone deacetylase-2 ( Q92769 ) in P98088 -expressing NHBE cells . ChIP also showed a rapid temporal recruitment of Q92769 to the GRE3 and GRE5 cis-elements in the P98088 promoter in both cell types . The knockdown of Q92769 by Q92769 -specific short interfering RNA prevented the DB00514 -induced repression of P98088 in NHBE and A549 cells . These data demonstrate that GR and Q92769 are recruited to the GRE3 and GRE5 cis-sites in the P98088 promoter and mediate the DB00514 -induced cis repression of P98088 gene expression . A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby glucocorticoids repress P98088 gene expression may be useful in formulating therapeutic interventions in chronic lung diseases . Gender difference in the activity but not expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in human lung adenocarcinoma cells . The higher frequency of lung adenocarcinoma in women smokers than in men smokers suggests a role for gender-dependent factors in the etiology of lung cancer . We evaluated estrogen receptor ( ER ) alpha and beta expression and activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and normal lung fibroblasts . Q8N1N2 -length ERalpha and ERbeta proteins were expressed in all cell lines with higher ERbeta than ERalpha . Although estradiol ( E(2) ) binding was similar , E(2) stimulated proliferation only in cells from females , and this response was inhibited by anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( DB04468 ) and DB00947 . In contrast , E(2) did not stimulate replication of lung adenocarcinoma cells from males and DB04468 or ICI did not block cell proliferation . Similarly , transcription of an estrogen response element-driven reporter gene was stimulated by E(2) in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females , but not males . P06401 ( PR ) expression was increased by E(2) in two out of five adenocarcinoma cell lines from females , but none from males . E(2) decreased P12830 protein expression in some of the cell lines from females , as it did in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , but not in the cell lines from males . Thus , ERalpha and ERbeta expression does not correlate with the effect of ER ligands on cellular activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells . On the other hand , coactivator Q15648 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females versus males and higher in adenocarcinoma cells than in normal human bronchial epithelial cells . Q15648 and other ER coregulators may contribute to differences in estrogen responsiveness between lung adenocarcinoma cells in females and males . Class I HDACs are mediators of smoke carcinogen-induced stabilization of P26358 and serve as promising targets for chemoprevention of lung cancer . DNA methylation is an early event in bronchial carcinogenesis and increased DNA methyltransferase ( P26358 )1 protein expression is a crucial step in the oncogenic transformation of epithelia . Here , we investigate the role of class I histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) 1 to 3 in the stabilization of P26358 protein and as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer chemoprevention . Long-term exposure of immortalized bronchial epithelial cells ( HBEC-3KT ) to low doses of tobacco-related carcinogens led to oncogenic transformation , increased HDAC expression , cell-cycle independent increased P26358 stability , and DNA hypermethylation . Overexpression of HDACs was associated with increased P26358 stability and knockdown of HDACs reduced P26358 protein levels and induced P26358 acetylation . This suggests a causal relationship among increased class I HDACs levels , upregulation of P26358 protein , and subsequent promoter hypermethylation . Targeting of class I HDACs with valproic acid ( DB00313 ) was associated with reduced HDAC expression and a profound reduction of P26358 protein level . Treatment of transformed bronchial epithelial cells with DB00313 resulted in reduced colony formation , demethylation of the aberrantly methylated Q96HF1 promoter , and derepression of Q96HF1 transcription . These data suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity may reverse or prevent carcinogen-induced transformation . Finally , immunohistochemistry on human lung cancer specimens revealed a significant increase in P26358 , Q13547 , Q92769 , and O15379 expression , supporting our hypotheses that class I HDACs are mediators of P26358 stability . In summary , our study provides evidence for an important role of class I HDACs in controlling the stability of P26358 and suggests that HDAC inhibition could be an attractive approach for lung cancer chemoprevention . Pathological study on the relationship between C4d , P13987 and C5b-9 in acute renal allograft rejection . In order to evaluate the activation or inhibition of the later phases of classical complement cascade in renal allograft presenting with acute rejection , particularly with C4d deposition on the peritubular capillary ( PTC ) , we observed the expression of P13987 and C5b-9 on the PTC . Subjective cases were divided into two groups , an acute rejection group , of 4 males and 6 females , and a normal donor group , of 5 males and 5 females . Renal biopsies were performed at the onset of acute rejection and at the transplant operation , before reperfusion . C4d deposition on PTC was found in three of 10 cases ( 30 % ) with biopsy proven acute rejection , whereas P13987 on PTC was positively expressed in all of the rejection cases . Although C5b-9 was not observed on PTC in the acute rejection group , it was intensively deposited on the tubular basement membrane ( P98088 ) in five cases , including the three with positive C4d on PTC . In the normal donor group , P13987 on PTC was intensively observed , whereas C5b-9 was weakly expressed on P98088 . P13987 , a complement regulatory factor , works as an inhibitory factor against the formation of C5b-9 , a membrane attack complex . From our data , we noted the dissociation between the depositions of C4d and C5b-9 on PTC . The substantially expressed P13987 on PTC may affect this dissociation between C4d and C5b-9 on PTC . The intensive deposition of C5b-9 on P98088 in acute rejection cases may suggest an independent immunological injury attacking tubular cells . DB00087 in allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation . INTRODUCTION : With the use of reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) , early toxicity of allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) has been much reduced . Graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) causes morbidities and mortality . DB00087 is a mAb directed against P31358 . When administered prior to transplant , it leads to T-cell depletion . Incorporation of alemtuzumab in RIC results in low rates of GvHD and treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) in haematological diseases , even in the setting of mismatched-donor transplantation . AREAS COVERED : The use of alemtuzumab for GvHD prophylaxis in P09683 . The benefit of alemtuzumab-based conditioning is partially offset by increased disease relapse due to impaired graft-versus-tumor effect ( GvT ) and by slower immune reconstitution , necessitating special precautions . While GvHD is prevented with alemtuzumab , post- P09683 interventions are often required . Most studies find that alemtuzumab-based conditioning results in decreased chronic GvHD and TRM , but also in decreased progression-free survival . Overall survival after 3 - 5 years is usually equivalent and quality of life may be improved because of a lower incidence of sequelae of chronic GvHD . Many aspects of alemtuzumab treatment are under investigation . EXPERT OPINION : DB00087 reduces GvHD and TRM after P09683 . Use of alemtuzumab requires awareness and strict management of the risk of opportunistic infections and of an increased risk of disease recurrence . Pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab used for in vivo and in vitro T-cell depletion in allogeneic transplantations : relevance for early adoptive immunotherapy and infectious complications . Persistence of alemtuzumab at lympholytic concentrations after reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantations ( RITs ) could impair immune reconstitution and reduce donor T-cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma ( GVL ) effects , derived from the graft or subsequent adoptive immunotherapy . We have studied the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab in 2 different groups : Q92963 ( 100 mg alemtuzumab in vivo over 5 days ) and myeloablative allografts ( 20 mg alemtuzumab added in vitro to the stem cells prior to return ) . DB00087 concentrations in Q92963 patients were in excess of that required to kill infused donor P31358 + cells at the time of transplantation and remained at potentially lympholytic levels ( > 0.1 microg/mL ) for approximately 56 days after transplantation , 26 days longer than for the myeloablative group . Total lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in the Q92963 group persisting beyond 6 months after transplantation ( P =.005 ) , and median absolute P01730 counts higher than 200 x 106/L were delayed until 9 months after transplantation . DB00087 in peripheral T-cell malignancies . The humanized monoclonal antibody CAMPATH-1H ( alemtuzumab ) binds to the P31358 antigen , a glycoprotein that is widely expressed on normal and malignant B- and T-lymphocytes . Over the past 5 years , a number of trials have demonstrated that alemtuzumab has clinical activity in mature T-cell diseases such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . In heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory patients alemtuzumab induced responses in more than two thirds of T-PLL and more than 50 % of CTCL patients . Responding patients had improved survival compared to nonresponders . DB00087 is particularly effective in clearing malignant lymphocytes from peripheral blood and bone marrow and may therefore facilitate stem-cell transplantation ( P09683 ) in selected patients . The toxicity profile for the antibody is acceptable ; the major complications are infusional reactions , which generally subside after the first 1-2 weeks of therapy , and prolonged lymphopenia associated with reactivation of viruses . These can be minimized by careful monitoring and the use of prophylactic therapy . Future studies will be directed toward : alternative routes ( subcutaneous ) and schedules of administration ; use as first-line therapy ; combination strategies with conventional chemotherapy ; and use of alemtuzumab to purge minimal residual bone-marrow disease prior to P09683 . Interaction of tacrolimus(FK506) and its metabolites with FKBP and calcineurin . DB00864 (FK506) is a strong immuno-suppressant and shows its activity through inhibiting P60568 mRNA transcription by forming pentameric complex with intracellular receptor ( FK506 binding protein 12 kDa or P62942 ) , Ca2+ , calmodulin , and calcineurin . Here , we report the binding activity to P62942 , the pentameric complex formation and Con-A response inhibiting activities of 7 metabolites . C15-demethylated metabolite(M-3) needed higher quantity to compete in Con-A assay and in pentamer formation assay , although it binds more strongly to P62942 . The result suggests that the ability to form a pentameric complex is not a two step reaction with the first binding to P62942 , but a single step reaction by components for the pentamer formation . t(1;3)(p36; P38936 ) is a recurring therapy-related translocation . Chromosome bands 1p36 and 3p21 are known to be recurring breakpoints in therapy-related ( t- ) leukemia . We identified a recurring translocation , t(1;3)(p36; P38936 ) , in eight patients with various hematologic malignancies : three patients with ALL , one with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) in accelerated phase ( AP ) , two with P43034 , and two with AML(M3) . Five of the eight patients had a history of chemotherapy , including alkylating agents in three , before the translocation was detected . In two of these five patients , the t(1;3)(p36; P38936 ) emerged only at relapse or in the accelerated phase of CML . The karyotypes of the patients were complex , including -7 and structural abnormalities of 5q , 6q , 7q , 9p , and 11q23 . Survival time varied among patients ( 25 days to more than 16 years ) . Using Q5TCZ1 with 13 1p35-36 cosmid probes ( tel-FB12- P35218 -G7-FD2- P21554 -ED8-FD9-G32- P48751 -G50-AD8-GG4-G43-cen ) , we delineated the 1p36 breakpoint in two patients with P43034 and ALL as lying between FB12 and FD2 ( between BAC47P3 and PAC963K15 ) , with a small deletion near the breakpoint in both cases . In the patient with P43034 , there was also a deletion at 3p21.3 , as detected with the cosmid probe cosNRL9 . The results of the present study suggest that t(1;3)(p36; P38936 ) in hematologic diseases is associated with prior exposure to mutagens , including alkylating agents . Down-regulation of lipoprotein lipase increases glucose uptake in Q9BTT4 muscle cells . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) are synthetic hypoglycemic agents used to treat type 2 diabetes . TZDs target the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) and improve systemic insulin sensitivity . The contributions of specific tissues to TZD action , or the downstream effects of P37231 activation , are not very clear . We have used a rat skeletal muscle cell line ( Q9BTT4 cells ) to demonstrate that TZDs directly target P37231 in muscle cells . TZD treatment resulted in a significant repression of lipoprotein lipase ( P06858 ) expression in Q9BTT4 cells . This repression correlated with an increase in glucose uptake . Down-regulation of P06858 message and protein levels using siRNA resulted in a similar increase in insulin-dependent glucose uptake . Thus , P06858 down-regulation improved insulin sensitivity independent of TZDs . This finding provides a novel method for the management of insulin resistance . [ The first case of single pancreas transplantation in Hungary ] . Simultaneous pancreas kidney ( SPK ) transplantation is the only routinely used therapeutic option which can provide insulin independence , euglycemia and good renal replacement for type I diabetes mellitus patients with end stage renal disease . Several patients have some complications of diabetes without renal failure . For these patients pancreas transplantation alone is a therapeutic option . The first pancreas transplantation alone was performed 6 years after the launch of our pancreas transplant program . The patient was a 40-years-old man . Enteric drainage was used with portal venous drainage . Anti P60568 . R antibody , daclizumab was given as prolonged induction therapy . In spite of the technical and immunological difficulties there were neither technical failures nor acute rejection . 3 years after the transplantation the patient has a good quality of life without insulin therapy with excellent renal function . CONCLUSION : P03951 transplant is a routinely used therapeutic option with good survival rate and good quality of life for type I diabetes mellitus patients without end stage renal disease . The transcriptional coactivator DRIP/mediator complex is involved in vitamin D receptor function and regulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation . Mediator is a multisubunit coactivator complex that facilitates transcription of nuclear receptors . We investigated the role of the mediator complex as a coactivator for vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) in keratinocytes . Using P11473 affinity beads , the vitamin D receptor interacting protein ( DRIP ) /mediator complex was purified from primary keratinocytes , and its subunit composition was determined by mass spectrometry . The complex included core subunits , such as Q15648 /MED1 ( MED1 ) , that directly binds to P11473 . Additional subunits were identified that are components of the RNA polymerase II complex . The functions of different mediator components were investigated by silencing its subunits . The core subunit MED1 facilitates P11473 activity and regulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation . A newly described subunit Q13503 also has a role in promoting keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation , whereas Q9BTT4 has an inhibitory role . Blocking MED1/ Q13503 expression caused hyperproliferation of keratinocytes , accompanied by increases in mRNA expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 and/or glioma-associated oncogene homolog . Blocking MED1 or Q13503 expression also resulted in defects in calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation , as indicated by decreased expression of differentiation markers and decreased translocation of P12830 to the membrane . These results show that keratinocytes use the transcriptional coactivator mediator to regulate P11473 functions and control keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation . Differential reconstitution of T cell subsets following immunodepleting treatment with alemtuzumab ( anti- P31358 monoclonal antibody ) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis . DB00087 ( anti- P31358 mAb ) provides long-lasting disease activity suppression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) . The objective of this study was to characterize the immunological reconstitution of T cell subsets and its contribution to the prolonged RRMS suppression following alemtuzumab-induced lymphocyte depletion . The study was performed on blood samples from RRMS patients enrolled in the CARE-MS II clinical trial , which was recently completed and led to the submission of alemtuzumab for U.S . Food and Drug Administration approval as a treatment for RRMS . DB00087 -treated patients exhibited a nearly complete depletion of circulating P01730 (+) lymphocytes at day 7 . During the immunological reconstitution , P01730 (+)CD25(+)CD127(low) regulatory T cells preferentially expanded within the P01730 (+) lymphocytes , reaching their peak expansion at month 1 . The increase in the percentage of TGF-β1- , P22301 - , and P05112 -producing P01730 (+) cells reached a maximum at month 3 , whereas a significant decrease in the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells was detected at months 12 and 24 in comparison with the baseline . A gradual increase in serum P13232 and P05112 and a decrease in Q16552 , Q96PD4 , Q9HBE4 , Q9GZX6 , and IFN-γ levels were detected following treatment . In vitro studies have demonstrated that P13232 induced an expansion of P01730 (+)CD25(+)CD127(low) regulatory T cells and a decrease in the percentages of Th17 and Th1 cells . In conclusion , our results indicate that differential reconstitution of T cell subsets and selectively delayed P01730 (+) T cell repopulation following alemtuzumab-induced lymphopenia may contribute to its long-lasting suppression of disease activity . DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia : discovery , design and first therapeutic experiences . INTRODUCTION : DNA methylation is an epigenetic change mediated by DNA methyltranferases ( DNMTs ) , which are promising epigenetic targets for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . This is evidenced by the two P26358 inhibitors ( azacitidine and decitabine ) approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and the first clinical data available in AML . AREAS COVERED : This paper reviews data from the international literature regarding the design , sites of impact and pharmacodynamic characteristics of P26358 inhibitors , and their first clinical experiences in AML . EXPERT OPINION : The strongest advances in epigenetic therapy have been in the treatment of AML . There are now an increasing number of P26358 inhibitors . These agents may be potentially administered at different times of leukemia therapy : before or instead of chemotherapy , as maintenance therapy , prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant ( P09683 ) or after relapse following P09683 . P06401 level as a predictor of response to megestrol acetate in advanced breast cancer : a retrospective study . DB00351 ( 160 mg/day ) produced a response rate of 44 % in a retrospective series of 39 evaluable patients with advanced breast cancer . The estrogen-receptor ( ER ) level was greater than 10 fmols/mg of protein in 28 patients , and the progesterone-receptor ( PR ) level was greater than 10 fmols/mg of protein in 26 patients . ER and PR levels , age , and disease-free interval were analyzed for their relationship to response . The PR was the single best predictor of response to megestrol acetate ; the addition of ER added 2 % to the predictive accuracy rate of PR alone . Mutation of beta-catenin and its protein accumulation in solid and cystic tumor of the pancreas associated with metastasis . P35222 serves not only as a structural component of the P12830 -mediated cell-cell adhesion system , but also as a signaling molecule of the Wnt/wingless pathway . Mutations of beta-catenin and aberrant expression of its protein have been identified in a number of different types of human malignancies . To determine the role of beta-catenin in solid and cystic tumor ( P09683 ) of the pancreas , a rare neoplasm usually observed in young females , we examined three primary tumors and one corresponding liver metastatic tumor presented in pediatric patients . Single strand conformation polymorphism and neucleotide sequencing analysis confirmed a TCT right curved arrow TTT somatic mutation at codon 37 changing serine to phenylalanine in one of the primary tumors and its corresponding metastatic tumor . Immunohistochemical analysis displayed abnormally strong nuclear and widespread cytoplasmic expression of beta-catenin in these tumors with the mutation . Our observations suggest that , in some SCTs of the pancreas presented in the pediatric age group , mutated beta-catenin has an important oncogenic effect . Sporadic breast carcinomas with somatic P38398 gene deletions share genotype/phenotype features with familial breast carcinomas . BACKGROUND : High frequencies of loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) are found in familial breast carcinomas with BRCA mutations . Although LOH of P38398 does not coincide with somatic P38398 mutations , reduced P38398 protein expression and hypermethylation indicate the involvement of P38398 in sporadic carcinogenesis . To further investigate the role of BRCA we determined LOH of P38398 and correlated this with LOH in other breast cancer-associated regions . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 105 sporadic breast carcinomas were analysed for LOH in the regions of P38398 , P51587 , P04637 , Caveolin1 , " putative BRCA3 " , P60484 , Q13315 and P12830 and correlated it with clinicopathological features . RESULTS : We found an overall increase of LOH in carcinomas with simultaneous LOH of P38398 . Significantly higher LOH rates were detected in the regions of P04637 ( 80 % : 34.7 % ; p < 0.005 ) , 8q21 ( 72.7 % : 30.6 % ; p < 0.010 ) and 10q22-23 ( 21.1 % : 5.9 % ; p=0.043 ) . Moreover , estrogen receptor-negative carcinomas revealed LOH of P38398 more frequently than estrogen receptor-positive carcinomas ( 39 % : 12 % ; p=0.003 ) . CONCLUSION : These data indicate that LOH of P38398 coincides with a defect of the DNA repair pathway . Therefore , LOH of P38398 determines a subgroup of sporadic breast carcinomas sharing genotype/phenotype features with familial breast carcinomas . Novel and emerging drugs for rarer chronic lymphoid leukaemias . Rarer chronic lymphoid leukaemias represent a challenge to the clinicians due to the limited information on their pathogenesis , difficulties on setting up prospective clinical trials and to their refractoriness to drugs used in the most common form of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) . In this review all these issues are addressed in three B-cell leukaemias : B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( B-PLL ) , hairy cell leukaemia ( HCL ) and HCL-variant and three T-cell leukaemias : T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( T-PLL ) , T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia ( T-cell LGLL ) and adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma ( ATLL ) . Data will be presented on the natural history , current therapies and emerging drugs potentially useful in the treatment of patients with these leukaemias . Emphasis is made on : 1- the novel agents targeting a variety of B and T-cell antigens expressed on the surface of the leukaemic cells ; these are either unconjugated monoclonal antibodies ( McAb ) such as DB00073 ( anti- P11836 ) , the second and third generation of anti- P11836 McAbs , DB00087 ( anti- P31358 ) , Siplizumab ( anti- P06729 ) , DB00111 ( anti-CD25 ) and KW-0761 , an anti-chemokine receptor 4 ( CCR4 ) or McAbs conjugated to toxins such as P20273 linked to the pseudomonas exotoxin or radiolabelled McAb ; 2- the use of new purine nucleosides such as nelarabine and 3- agents targeting deregulated genes in the leukaemic cells from these diseases such as the Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) Olarapib in T-PLL with deregulation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( Q13315 ) gene . Data of phase I and II clinical studies with these agents as well as the potential and current use of other drugs are outlined . Targeting Q01196 / Q06455 -histone deacetylase repressor complex : a novel mechanism for valproic acid-mediated gene expression and cellular differentiation in Q01196 / Q06455 -positive acute myeloid leukemia cells . In t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , the Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein promotes leukemogenesis by recruiting class I histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) -containing repressor complex to the promoter of Q01196 target genes . Valproic acid ( DB00313 ) , a commonly used antiseizure and mood stabilizer drug , has been shown to cause growth arrest and induce differentiation of malignant cells via HDAC inhibition . DB00313 causes selective proteasomal degradation of Q92769 but not other class I HDACs ( i.e. , HDAC 1 , 3 , and 8 ) . Therefore , we raised the question of whether this drug can effectively target the leukemogenic activity of the Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein that also recruits Q13547 , a key regulator of normal and aberrant histone acetylation . We report here that DB00313 treatment disrupts the Q01196 / Q06455 - Q13547 physical interaction , stimulates the global dissociation of Q01196 / Q06455 - Q13547 complex from the promoter of Q01196 / Q06455 target genes , and induces relocation of both Q01196 / Q06455 and Q13547 protein from nuclear to perinuclear region . Furthermore , we show that mechanistically these effects associate with a significant inhibition of HDAC activity , histone H3 and H4 hyperacetylation , and recruitment of RNA polymerase II , leading to transcriptional reactivation of target genes ( i.e. , P08700 ) otherwise silenced by Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein . Ultimately , these pharmacological effects resulted in significant antileukemic activity mediated by partial cell differentiation and caspase-dependent apoptosis . Taken together , these data support the notion that DB00313 might effectively target Q01196 / Q06455 -driven leukemogenesis through disruption of aberrant Q13547 function and that DB00313 should be integrated in novel therapeutic approaches for Q01196 / Q06455 -positive AML . DB00087 in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia . DB00087 is a humanized therapeutic monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) that recognizes the P31358 antigen , expressed on normal and neoplastic lymphocytes , monocytes , and natural killer cells . In 2001 , alemtuzumab was approved in the US and Europe to treat B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) that had been treated previously with alkylating agents and was refractory to fludarabine . In heavily pretreated patients this MAb is able to produce response rates of about 40 % , and in symptomatic , previously untreated patients response rates of more than 80 % can be achieved . DB00087 can also be used in patients with CLL as a preparative regimen for stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) and to prevent graft versus host disease . Moreover its in vivo use before or after P09683 may also potentially result in depletion of residual leukemia cells , especially in the autologous setting . Adverse events associated with alemtuzumab include acute first-dose reaction , hematologic toxicity , and infectious complications . Usually they are predictable , manageable , and acceptable in the context of CLL . However , in a significant percentage of patients , cytomegalovirus reactivation occurs during alemtuzumab therapy , and routine weekly monitoring with the polymerase chain reaction methodology is indicated . Moreover , antiviral and antibacterial prophylaxis is mandatory . Deficiency of a phosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule influences haemopoietic progenitor binding to marrow stroma in chronic myeloid leukaemia . The interactions between haemopoietic progenitor cells and marrow stromal cells that are essential for the regulation of normal haemopoiesis are defective in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . The presence of primitive progenitor cells ( blast colony-forming cells , Bl- Q15814 ) in the blood of patients with CML is reflected by their reduced capacity to bind to marrow derived stromal layers in vitro . Whereas normal bone marrow Bl- Q15814 bind irreversibly to cultured stromal layers ( and none are found in normal blood ) , the Bl- Q15814 in CML bind transiently and then detach . The normal cell adhesion mechanism is partially sensitive to treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C ( Pl- P98160 ) , indicating the participation of a phosphatidylinositol ( Pl ) -linked structure ; however , when CML cells were treated with Pl- P98160 it had no effect on progenitor binding . Two other Pl-linked structures , decay-accelerating factor ( P08174 ) and lymphocyte function associated antigen-3 ( LFA-3 ) were normally expressed on P28906 positive CML cells and normally susceptible to Pl- P98160 treatment . The treatment of normal cells with Pl- P98160 , to mimic the situation in CML , resulted in the indiscriminate and inefficient binding of Bl- Q15814 to stroma . Moreover , treatment of the normal cells with 5637 conditioned medium ( CM ) , which contains haemopoietic growth factors , also reduced the binding capacity of normal Bl- Q15814 ; 5637CM treatment did not alter the expression of P08174 . It is proposed that a Pl-linked cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) is deficient in CML as a consequence of the constitutive activation of P00519 kinase whilst , in normal cells , CAMs attached in this manner are responsible for efficient adhesion to stroma and are regulated by growth factors . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation using alemtuzumab-containing regimens in severe aplastic anemia . DB00087 , a humanized anti- P31358 , IgG1 monoclonal antibody , is used to reduce graft-versus- host disease ( GVHD ) and aid engraftment after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . Its associated low incidence of GVHD makes it an attractive alternative to anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) in transplant conditioning regimen for severe aplastic anaemia ( P0DJI8 ) . We have reviewed the use of alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimen for HSCT in P0DJI8 and show that it results in sustained haematological engraftment , a very low incidence of chronic GVHD without an increase in viral infections . Intriguingly , alemtuzumab appears to induce tolerance post-HSCT with the findings of stable mixed T cell chimerism with full donor myeloid chimerism and the absence of chronic GVHD , and which persist on withdrawal of post-graft immunosuppression . Finally , its low toxicity profile may permit future application of HSCT to older patients with P0DJI8 who fail to respond to immunosuppressive therapy . DB00087 in the treatment of refractory acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after human lung transplantation . Despite substantial improvements in early survival after lung transplantation , refractory acute rejection ( RAR ) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) remain major contributors to transplant-related morbidity and mortality . We have utilized alemtuzumab , a humanized anti- P31358 antibody which results in potent lymphocyte depletion , in consecutive patients with RAR ( n = 12 ) or BOS ( n = 10 ) . All patients failed conventional treatment with methylprednisolone and antithymocyte globulin and received strict infection prophylaxis . DB00087 significantly improved histological rejection scores in RAR . Total rejection grade/biopsy was 1.98 +/- 0.25 preceding alemtuzumab versus 0.33 +/- 0.14 posttreatment , p-value < 0.0001 ( with a similar number of biopsies/patient per respective time interval ) . Freedom from BOS was observed in 65 % of RAR patients 2 years after alemtuzumab treatment . Although there was no statistically significant change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) before and after alemtuzumab treatment in patients with BOS , a stabilization or improvement in BOS grade occurred in 70 % of patients . Patient survival 2 years after alemtuzumab for BOS was 69 % . Despite a dramatic decline in P01730 counts in alemtuzumab-treated patients , only one patient developed a lethal infection . Thus , we provide the first evidence that alemtuzumab is a potentially useful therapy in lung transplant recipients with RAR or BOS . [ DB00087 , a monoclonal antibody against P31358 : hopes and fears ] . P31358 , an antigen expressed on immune cells including mature T lymphocytes , is thought to be involved in immunomodulatory mechanisms . DB00087 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against P31358 , which causes a marked and long-term decrease in immune cells , especially P01730 -positive T lymphocytes . A few randomized clinical trials have revealed the efficacy of alemtuzumab to be much greater than that of interferon-β in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis . However , the development of other autoimmune disorders , including autoimmune thyroid disorders and thrombocytic purpura , because of alemtuzumab application has been considered an obstacle in its widespread use . Targeted deletion of cannabinoid receptors P21554 and CB2 produced enhanced inflammatory responses to influenza A/PR/8/34 in the absence and presence of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol . We have previously reported that Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Delta(9)-THC ) -treated mice challenged with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 ( PR8 ) developed increased viral hemagglutinin 1 ( H1 ) mRNA levels and decreased monocyte and lymphocyte recruitment to the pulmonary airways when compared with mice challenged with PR8 alone . The objective of the present study was to examine the role of cannabinoid ( CB(1)/CB(2) ) receptors in mediating the effects of Delta(9)-THC on immune and epithelial cell responses to PR8 . In the current study , Delta(9)-THC-treated CB(1)/CB(2) receptor null ( CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- ) and wild-type mice infected with PR8 had marked increases in viral H1 mRNA when compared with CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- and wild-type mice challenged with PR8 alone . However , the magnitude of the H1 mRNA levels was greatly reduced in CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- mice as compared with wild-type mice . In addition , Delta(9)-THC-treated CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- mice infected with PR8 had increased P01730 + T cells and P01579 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with greater pulmonary inflammation when compared with Delta(9)-THC-treated wild-type mice infected with PR8 . Delta(9)-THC treatment of CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- mice in the presence or absence of PR8 challenge also developed greater amounts of mucous cell metaplasia in the affected bronchiolar epithelium . Collectively , the immune and airway epithelial cell responses to PR8 challenge in Delta(9)-THC-treated CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- and wild-type mice indicated the involvement of CB(1)/CB(2) receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms . DB00087 for the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease . DB00087 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the P31358 antigen , which is expressed on the surface of various hematopoietic cells such as B and T lymphocytes , and has been widely used for preventing acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) in allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) . Administration of 100 mg alemtuzumab before transplantation has resulted in a low incidence of acute GVHD in HLA-matched and mismatched transplantation from either related or unrelated donors . However , because alemtuzumab could remain in the blood at the lympholytic level 1-2 months after transplantation , immune reconstitution was substantially delayed , leading to a high incidence of viral infection and relapse . A dose reduction of alemtuzumab was attempted in a reduced-intensity conditioning setting to facilitate immune reconstitution , and this resulted in earlier immune reconstitution , but the clinical benefits were unclear . The dose of alemtuzumab and the timing of its administration should be optimized to maximize the benefit of acute GVHD suppression and minimize the risk of infection and relapse . Another strategy to facilitate immune reconstitution and augment anti-tumor effects is donor cell infusion of T and NK cells . Although there is accumulating evidence regarding the use of alemtuzumab for acute GVHD prevention , information on the salvage treatment for steroid-refractory acute and chronic GVHD is still limited . In vivo cytokine responses to interleukin-2 immunotherapy after autologous stem cell transplantation in children with solid tumors . The potent immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) has been extensively investigated for its potential to induce anti-tumor immunity in a number of tumor models . Only recently the complex interplay of mutually suppressive or supportive cytokines of the P60568 -induced network of cytokines has been better characterized . The aim of this study was to assess which of these in vitro findings are reproducible in vivo in recipients of stem cell transplants ( P09683 ) , since in these patients long- lasting impairments in cytokine inducibility have been described . We have therefore studied the kinetics of putative modulators and mediators of P60568 -induced immune activation , namely IL-1beta , P05112 , P05113 , P22301 , IL-12 , soluble P48023 ( sFasL ) , and GM- P04141 during P60568 therapy . All patients were children or adolescents suffering from solid tumors with poor prognosis who received three 5-day courses of high-dose intravenous P60568 as an adjuvant to their radio-chemotherapy and autologous P09683 . While IL-1beta , P05112 and IL-12 were not , and sFasL was only mildly affected by the P60568 therapy , we observed a consistent and early rise of P22301 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 . These increases were rapidly reversible after discontinuation of P60568 therapy . The inducibility of P22301 , P05113 and GM- P04141 was more pronounced with increasing time from the P09683 , and in the third cycle reached an order of magnitude as in high-dose P60568 patients without P09683 . Together with the abundant in vitro data , these findings may help devise a combination immunotherapy permitting stronger anti-tumor effects , but lesser adverse effects . Effects of external calcium on the biotransformation of DB06749 to ginsenoside Rd by Paecilomyces bainier 229-7 . DB01373 is a known signalling molecule in eukaryotic cells and plays a central role in the regulation of many cellular processes . In the following study , we report on the effect of external calcium treatments on the biotransformation of DB06749 to ginsenoside Rd by Paecilomyces bainier 229-7 . We observed that the intracellular calcium content of P. bainier 229-7 mycelia was increased in response to exposure to high external Ca(2+) concentrations . Both ginsenoside Rd biotransformation and β-glucosidase activity were both found to be dependent on the external calcium concentration . At an optimal Ca(2+) concentration of 45 mM , maximal ginsenoside Rd bioconversion rate of 92.44 % was observed and maximal β-glucosidase activity of 0.1778 U was reached in a 72-h biotransformation . The Ca(2+) channel blocker Verapamil blocked the trans-membrane influx of calcium and decreased ginsenoside Rd biotransformatiom . In addition , β-glucosidase activity and ginsenoside Rd content decreased by 36.0 and 29.2 % respectively after a 72-h incubation in the presence of 0.05 mM P62158 ( P62158 ) antagonist DB00850 . These results suggest that both Ca(2+) channels and P62158 are involved in ginsenoside Rd biotransformation via regulation of β-glucosidase activity . This is the first report regarding the effects of calcium signal transduction on biotransformation and enzyme activity in fungi . Cytokine-induced beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase in human endothelial cells mediates alpha 2,6-sialylation of adhesion molecules and P20273 ligands . Sialic acids decorating blood and cell surface proteins can play important roles in various biological processes . The inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) and interleukin-1 , as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide , can activate vascular endothelium , increasing expression of several surface glycoproteins . Here we show that treatment of cultured human endothelial cells ( O14777 ) with P01375 , interleukin-1 , or lipopolysaccharide causes increased expression of the enzyme beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialytransferase ( alpha 2-6STN ) . P01375 was most effective , inducing a 3.5-fold enhancement of cell-associated sialytransferase activity by 72 h . In addition , activated O14777 secreted a large portion of the induced sialyltransferase activity into the medium . Analysis of labeled O14777 showed both a relative and an absolute increase of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid on N-linked oligosaccharides after P01375 stimulation . This coincided with increased expression of endothelial glycoproteins bearing N-linked glycans with alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid detected by the lectin Sambucus nigra agglutinin . The cytokine-inducible endothelial cell adhesion molecules P16581 , P05362 , and P19320 are among these glycoprotein substrates for alpha 2-6STN . These changes also correlated with a substantial increase in binding sites for P20273 beta , a mammalian lectin known to recognize oligosaccharides carrying multiple copies of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid . Northern analysis revealed increased levels of mRNA encoding alpha 2-6STN . Thus , activation of endothelial cells during inflammatory and immunological processes may induce alpha 2-6STN , which can participate in sialylation of other activation-dependent molecules . In vivo alemtuzumab enables haploidentical human leukocyte antigen-mismatched hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation without ex vivo graft manipulation . BACKGROUND : DB00087 , a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human P31358 , has a strong lympholytic effect . This study evaluates the safety of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation from two or three loci-mismatched related donors using alemtuzumab in vivo . METHODS : A total body irradiation-based regimen was used in young patients , whereas those 50 years or older received fludarabine-based conditioning . DB00087 was added to these regimens by intravenous infusion at 0.2 mg/kg per day for 6 days ( days -8 to -3 ) . RESULTS : We treated 12 patients with a median age of 49.5 years . Eight patients demonstrated active disease , and four patients demonstrated acute leukemia in high-risk remission . All achieved neutrophil engraftment a median of 17.5 days after transplantation with complete donor-type chimerism . The cumulative incidence of grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease was only 9 % . Infection-related deaths were not observed . CD3+/ P01730 + and CD3+/CD8+ T cells were strongly suppressed within 2 months after transplantation , but recovered on day 90 . Relapse was observed in five of eight patients who underwent transplantation for active disease , whereas none of the three patients who underwent transplantation in first remission had a relapse . CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that in vivo alemtuzumab enables haploidentical hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation without ex vivo graft manipulation . [ A colorimetric method of O14777 toxin hemolysis test for diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ] . The purpose of the study is to establish a colorimetric method of O14777 toxin hemolysis test for diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) . RBCs from normal persons and patients with PNH and non-PNH anemia were treated with O14777 toxin secreted by Aeromonas hydrophila J-1 strain and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured to quantitate the extent of hemolysis . The results demonstrated that the RBCs from PNH patients showed resistance to the toxin hemolysis , which was in accord with the percentages of P13987 (-) cells , while the RBCs from normal persons and non-PNH anemic patients were nearly totally lysed . It is concluded that the method can be considered as a simple , specific and reliable method for the diagnosis of PNH . [ Measurement of rifampicin and clarithromycin in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection ] . DB01045 ( RFP ) induces hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes , making drug interactions a very important clinical problem . DB01211 ( P62158 ) metabolism is reportedly enhanced by induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes ( P08684 ) by RFP , so that the blood lend of P62158 decreases when RFP is administered concurrently . We connected an electrochemical detector to a high-performance liquid chromatograph ( HPLC ) for simple , rapid , easy measurement of blood concentrations of RFP and P62158 . Using samples of patient serum , normal serum , and reference standards , we compared HPLC by an external laboratory and the results of LC/MS/MS analysis with those of this new assay . A strong correlation was seen between our HPLC results and those of the external laboratory in RFP levels ( r=0.975 , p < 0.01 ) . A strong correlation was also seen between results we obtained for P62158 with the electrochemical detector in this assay and values measured by LC/MS/MS analysis ( r=0.995 , p < 0.01 ) . Our method enabled simple , rapid measurement of RFP and P62158 by connecting the HPLC and electrochemical detector in tandem . This system was used to modulate dosage during combined therapy with RFP and P62158 . The therapeutic effect for nontuberculous mycobacteriosis is expected to improve , and our HPLC is expected to be useful for simple , rapid , easy measurement of blood concentrations . Increased levels of Candida albicans mannan-specific T-cell-derived antigen binding molecules in patients with invasive candidiasis . In addition to cytokines , P01730 + T cells have been found to secrete soluble , T-cell-derived antigen binding molecules ( TABMs ) . These antigen-specific immunoproteins are thought to have immunoregulatory properties in the suppression of cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) because they often associate with interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) and transforming growth factor beta . Decreased CMI causes susceptibility to infections caused by organisms which are normally nonpathogenic . In this situation , e.g. , Candida albicans saprophytism may develop into invasive candidiasis . The difficult diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is based on the findings obtained from blood cultures and with tissue biopsy specimens , with some additional diagnostic value gained by the detection of Candida albicans mannan antigenemia and antimannan antibodies . In the present study , Candida albicans mannan-specific TABM ( P62158 -TABM ) levels in the sera of patients with invasive candidiasis ( n = 11 ) , Candida colonization ( n = 11 ) and noncolonization ( n = 10 ) , recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis ( n = 30 ) , and atopic eczema dermatitis syndrome ( n = 59 ) and healthy controls ( n = 30 ) were analyzed . For 14 participants , the effect of mannan stimulation on TABM production and gamma interferon ( P01579 ) and P05112 mRNA expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes was also studied . It was demonstrated that P62158 -TABM production was the highest in patients with invasive candidiasis and that P62158 -TABM levels could distinguish Candida-colonized patients from noncolonized patients . In addition , the P62158 -TABM level was directly related to mRNA expression for P05112 but not P01579 . These results reinforce the view that TABMs are associated with decreased CMI , immunoregulation , and the T-helper cell 2-type immune response . DB00087 as a bridge to allogeneic P09683 in atypical hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis . BACKGROUND : A 39-year-old woman with no relevant medical or family history was admitted to hospital with episodic fever , which persisted despite antibiotic therapy . Other notable findings at admission were splenomegaly , pancytopenia , hyponatremia , elevated levels of liver enzymes , hyperferritinemia and hypofibrinogenemia . INVESTIGATIONS : Physical examination , laboratory tests , rheumatic marker serology , pathogen detection assays , complete blood counts , measurement of levels of ferritin , fibrinogen , triglycerides and soluble CD25 , natural killer cell functional studies , P14222 mutation analysis , renal biopsy , bone marrow biopsy , CT imaging of the chest and abdomen . DIAGNOSIS : Idiopathic , atypical hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis . MANAGEMENT : Initial treatment with antibiotics was followed by immunosuppressive therapy ( including intravenous immunoglobulin , ciclosporin , infliximab , corticosteroids and etoposide ) . Remission was achieved by treatment with the anti- P31358 monoclonal antibody , alemtuzumab , after which allogeneic stem-cell transplantation ( with reduced-intensity conditioning treatment and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis ) resulted in a definitive cure .
Molecular weight and biochemical profile of a chemically modified heparin derivative , Suleparoide . Recently , a new chemically modified derivative of heparin ( Suleparoide , Syntex Laboratories Buenos Aires , Argentina ) was introduced for the prophylaxis of thrombosis and treatment of vascular disorders . This agent is claimed to contain a depolymerized , chemically modified , heparin derivative with similar biologic actions as heparan sulfate . To study the pharmacologic profile of this agent , we have defined its molecular weight distribution profile , utilizing a computerized gel permeation chromatographic system equipped with ultraviolet and refractive index detectors . Suleparoide exhibited a normal molecular distribution profile with no contaminants . It exhibited a weight average of 9.3 K DA and an apparent peak MW of 8.0 K DA . Approximately 50 % of the molecular components were < 5.0 K DA and 40 % > 5.0 K DA . The results from these studies on the mechanisms show that Suleparoide has anticoagulant activity primarily mediated through DB01109 Cofactor-II ( P05546 ) and because of its novel mechanism of action , further investigations on the biochemical profile of Suleparoide are carried out . Global clotting tests such as Activated Partial P13726 Time ( APTT ) , Heptest and Thrombin Time ( TT ) revealed a concentration dependent effect in all assays . Plasma samples supplemented with Suleparoide exhibited no significant anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities . However , in the P05546 mediated inhibitory assay for IIa , Suleparoide exhibited significant activity . In contrast , the P01008 ( DB11598 ) mediated inhibition of IIa was much weaker . Copy number analysis of 24 oncogenes : O15151 identified as a putative marker for low recurrence risk in non muscle invasive bladder cancer . Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) generally have a high risk of relapsing locally after primary tumor resection . The search for new predictive markers of local recurrence thus represents an important goal for the management of this disease . We studied the copy number variations ( CNVs ) of 24 oncogenes ( O15151 , P04198 , Q9UM73 , P16234 , P10721 , P35968 , P00374 , P00533 , MET , SMO , P11362 , MYC , P00519 , P07949 , P24385 , P30279 , P11802 , Q00987 , Q96GD4 , P04626 , P11388 , O14965 , AR and P15056 ) using multiplex ligation probe amplification technique to verify their role as predictive markers of recurrence . DB03843 -fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 43 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder ( TURB ) were used ; 23 patients had relapsed and 20 were disease-free after 5 years . Amplification frequencies were analyzed for all genes and O15151 was the only gene that showed significantly higher amplification in non recurrent patients than in recurrent ones ( 0.65 vs. 0.3 ; Fisher 's test p=0.023 ) . Recurrence-free survival analysis confirmed the predictive role of O15151 ( log-rank test p=0.041 ) . Our preliminary results indicate a putative role for the O15151 gene in predicting local recurrence of bladder cancer . Confirmation of this hypothesis is needed in a larger cohort of NMIBC patients . [ Bone metastasis in prostate cancer ] . Bone metastasis and skeletal complications have a devastating impact on the quality of life and are a major cause of morbidity in prostate cancer patients . In addition to established bone-targeted therapies , new drugs such as endothelin A receptor antagonists , MET and P35968 antagonists or radiopharmaceuticals are in the focus of development . The standard care in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases to prevent skeletal-related events ( SRE ) are bisphosphonates . DB06643 , a human monoclonal antibody against O14788 , appeared to be superior to zoledronic acid for prevention of SRE and has been shown to prolong bone metastases-free survival . In contrast to zoledronic acid , denosumab clearance is not dependent on kidney function and can be administered subcutaneously . Similar rates of toxicity were observed for both substances ; however , long-term data for denosumab are limited . A valuable adjunct to FNA diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma : in-house PCR assay for P15056 T1799A ( V600E ) . The diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules generally starts with FNA cytology . However , approximately one-fifth of cytologic evaluations yield indeterminate cytological findings but only 20 % of cases with indeterminate thyroid nodule cytology have a cancer diagnosis , emphasizing the need for an effective ancillary test based on FNA material to help prevent unnecessary surgery . Detection of BRAFV600E mutation , the genetic signature of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) in FNA material provides an invaluable diagnostic adjunct to overcome the limitations of FNA cytology . There are many ways to detect V600E , such as direct DNA sequencing , allele-specific PCR and hybridization-based colorimetric methods . In this study , a newer simple PCR method is presented that removes requirements for sequencing special equipment and commercial kits . Two forward primers including the mutant sequence specific ( F2 ) , and one common reverse ( R ) primer were optimized to generate a 241 bp fragment ( F1R ) , an internal PCR control , and a 141 bp fragment ( P25116 ) denoting the presence of V600E . Sensitivity studies revealed that the assay is capable of detecting V600E even in 1 ng of DNA . Direct sequencing data of 241 bp F1R fragment proved the specificity of the assay . For validation studies of the sequence specific multiplex PCR assay , archival FNA slides were used in a group of thyroid lesions including PTC , follicular carcinoma , follicular adenoma , Hashimoto thyroiditis , and benign thyroid nodules . The newer PCR-based method presented in this study is a practical , inexpensive one-step assay to detect the P15056 T1796A mutation on FNA samples . DB00741 is a suppressor of apoptosis in bovine corpus luteum . Glucocorticoid ( GC ) acts as a modulator of physiological functions in several organs . In the present study , we examined whether GC suppresses luteolysis in bovine corpus luteum ( CL ) . DB00741 ( an active GC ) reduced the mRNA expression of caspase 8 ( Q14790 ) and caspase 3 ( P42574 ) and reduced the enzymatic activity of P42574 and cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and interferon gamma ( P01579 ) in cultured bovine luteal cells . mRNAs and proteins of GC receptor ( P04150 ) , 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( P28845 ) , and P80365 were expressed in CL throughout the estrous cycle . Moreover , the protein expression and the enzymatic activity of P28845 were high at the early and the midluteal stages compared to the regressed luteal stage . These results suggest that cortisol suppresses P01375 - P01579 -induced apoptosis in vitro by reducing apoptosis signals via Q14790 and P42574 in bovine CL and that the local increase in cortisol production resulting from increased P28845 at the early and midluteal stages helps to maintain CL function by suppressing apoptosis of luteal cells . P10275 promotes esophageal cancer cell migration and proliferation via matrix metalloproteinase 2 . Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide . P10275 ( AR ) plays an important role in many kinds of cancers . However , the molecular mechanisms of AR in ESCC are poorly characterized . In the present study , Western blot analysis and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to identify differentially expressed AR in 40 ESCC tissue samples , which revealed that the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein expression of AR is upregulated in the ESCC tissue samples . AR overexpression induced increases in ESCC cell invasion and proliferation in vitro . Silencing of AR inhibited the proliferation of KYSE450 cells which have a relatively high level of AR , and the invasion of KYSE450 cells was distinctly suppressed . Furthermore , AR knockdown led to substantial reductions in matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( P08253 ) and p-AKT levels in ESCC cell lines , but no significant change in AKT and P14780 expression . These results suggest that AR is involved in tumor progression , and thus , AR could represent selective targets for the molecularly targeted treatments of ESCC . Molecular mechanisms and modulation of key pathways underlying the synergistic interaction of sorafenib with erlotinib in non-small-cell-lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells . Combination of drugs with different targets is a logical approach to overcome multilevel cross-stimulation among key pathways in NSCLC progression such as P00533 , K-Ras and VEGFR . The sorafenib-erlotinib combination showed clinical activity and acceptable safety . Therefore , we evaluated mechanisms underlying sorafenib-erlotinib interaction in seven NSCLC cell lines selected for their heterogeneous pattern of P00533 and Raf-kinase-inhibitor protein ( P30086 ) expression , and P00533 /K-Ras mutations . Pharmacologic interaction was studied using MTT/ P50991 assays and the combination index ( CI ) method , while effects on P00533 , Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation , cell cycle and apoptosis were studied with western-blot , ELISA , and flow cytometry . Intracellular drug concentrations were measured with LC-MS/MS , whereas kinase activity profiles were generated on tyrosine kinase peptide substrate arrays . Synergism was detected in all cell lines , with CIs < 0.6 in K-Ras mutated A549 , SW1573 and H460 , as well as in H1975 ( P00533 -T790M ) cells . DB00398 slowed cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis , which was significantly increased in the combination . Moreover , sorafenib reduced Akt/ P29323 phosphorylation in erlotinib-resistant cells , associated with significant P30086 up-regulation . No direct drug interaction was detected by LC-MS/MS measurement , while lysates from A549 and H1975 cells exposed to erlotinib+sorafenib showed a significant inhibition in the phosphorylation of 16 overlapping peptides , including sites from RAF , P35968 , P09619 , P24941 and P12931 , suggesting new markers to identify NSCLC patients who are likely to respond to this treatment . In conclusion , several mechanisms , including apoptosis-induction , modulation of expression/phosphorylation of P30086 and crucial kinases contribute to erlotinib-sorafenib synergistic interaction and should be evaluated in future trials for the rational development of this combination in NSCLC . Temporal and pharmacological characterization of angiostatin release and generation by human platelets : implications for endothelial cell migration . Platelets play an important role in thrombosis and in neo-vascularisation as they release and produce factors that both promote and suppress angiogenesis . Amongst these factors is the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin , which is released during thrombus formation . The impact of anti-thrombotic agents and the kinetics of platelet angiostatin release are unknown . Hence , our objectives were to characterize platelet angiostatin release temporally and pharmacologically and to determine how angiostatin release influences endothelial cell migration , an early stage of angiogenesis . We hypothesized anti-platelet agents would suppress angiostatin release but not generation by platelets . Human platelets were aggregated and temporal angiostatin release was compared to vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . Immuno-gold electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy identified α-granules as storage organelles of platelet angiostatin . Acetylsalicylic acid , MRS2395 , P08514 /IIIa blocking peptide , and aprotinin were used to characterize platelet angiostatin release and generation . An endothelial cell migration assay was performed under hypoxic conditions to determine the effects of pharmacological platelet and angiostatin inhibition . Compared to P15692 , angiostatin generation and release from α-granules occurred later temporally during platelet aggregation . Consequently , collagen-activated platelet releasates stimulated endothelial cell migration more potently than maximally-aggregated platelets . Platelet inhibitors prostacyclin , S-nitroso-glutathione , acetylsalicylic acid , and P08514 /IIIa blocking peptide , but not a Q9H244 inhibitor , suppressed angiostatin release but not generation . Suppression of angiostatin generation in the presence of acetylsalicylic acid enhanced platelet-stimulated endothelial migration . Hence , the temporal and pharmacological modulation of platelet angiostatin release may have significant consequences for neo-vascularization following thrombus formation . Clinical outcome , role of P15056 (V600E) , and molecular pathways in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma : is it an indolent cancer or an early stage of papillary thyroid cancer ? Most human thyroid cancers are differentiated papillary carcinomas ( PTC ) . Papillary thyroid microcarcinomas ( PTMC ) are tumors that measure 1 cm or less . This class of small tumors has proven to be a very common clinical entity in endocrine diseases . PTMC may be present in 30-40 % of human autopsies and is often identified incidentally in a thyroid removed for benign clinical nodules . Although PTMC usually has an excellent long-term prognosis , it can metastasize to neck lymph nodes ; however deaths related to this type of thyroid tumor are very rare . Few data exist on molecular pathways that play a role in PTMC development ; however , two molecules have been shown to be associated with aggressive PTMC . P26447 ( calcium-binding protein ) , which plays a role in angiogenesis , extracellular matrix remodeling , and tumor microenvironment , is over-expressed in metastatic PTMC . In addition , the P15056 (V600E) mutation , the most common genetic alteration in PTC , is present in many PTMC with extra thyroidal extension and lymph node metastasis . Importantly , recently developed selective [ e.g. , PLX4720 , PLX4032 ( DB08881 , also called RG7204 ) ] or non-selective ( e.g. , DB00398 ) inhibitors of P15056 (V600E) may be an effective treatment for patients with P15056 (V600E)-expressing PTMCs with aggressive clinical-pathologic features . Here , we summarize the clinical outcome , cancer genetics , and molecular mechanisms of PTMC . DB00398 inhibits imatinib-resistant P10721 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta gatekeeper mutants . PURPOSE : Targeting of P10721 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) tyrosine kinases by imatinib is an effective anticancer strategy . However , mutations of the gatekeeper residue ( T670 in P10721 and T681 in PDGFRbeta ) render the two kinases resistant to imatinib . The aim of this study was to evaluate whether sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) , a multitargeted DB00171 -competitive inhibitor of P10721 and P09619 , was active against imatinib-resistant P10721 and PDGFRbeta kinases . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We used in vitro kinase assays and immunoblot with phosphospecific antibodies to determine the activity of sorafenib on P10721 and PDGFRbeta kinases . We also exploited reporter luciferase assays to measure the effects of sorafenib on P10721 and PDGFRbeta downstream signaling events . The activity of sorafenib on interleukin-3-independent proliferation of Ba/ P13726 cells expressing oncogenic P10721 or its imatinib-resistant T670I mutant was also tested . RESULTS : DB00398 efficiently inhibited gatekeeper mutants of P10721 and PDGFRbeta ( IC(50) for P10721 T670I , 60 nmol/L ; IC(50) for PDGFRbeta T681I , 110 nmol/L ) . Instead , it was less active against activation loop mutants of the two receptors ( IC(50) for P10721 D816V , 3.8 micromol/L ; IC(50) for PDGFRbeta D850V , 1.17 micromol/L ) that are also imatinib-resistant . DB00398 blocked receptor autophosphorylation and signaling of P10721 and PDGFRbeta gatekeeper mutants in intact cells as well as activation of P05412 -responsive and cyclin D1 gene promoters , respectively . Finally , the compound inhibited P10721 -dependent proliferation of Ba/ P13726 cells expressing the oncogenic P10721 mutant carrying the T670I mutation . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 might be a promising anticancer agent for patients carrying P10721 and PDGFRbeta gatekeeper mutations . Potential role of activated platelets in homing of human endothelial progenitor cells to subendothelial matrix . Endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) mobilize from the bone marrow in response to tissue injury and participate in vascular repair . However , there is limited data about the homing mechanisms of EPCs to vascular injury sites . Recently animal experiments indicated that platelets play a role in recruitment of EPCs to injury sites . However , data on the possible interaction between platelets and EPCs within the human system are limited . We , therefore , examined in-vitro human platelet-EPC interaction under static and flow conditions . Human EPCs were isolated from donated buffy coats by magnetic microbeads and flow cytometry cell sorting using CD133 and P35968 , respectively , as markers . Platelets were tested in the form of washed platelets , platelet rich plasma or whole blood . EPCs formed heterotypic aggregates with resting platelets under static conditions , an interaction that was greatly enhanced when platelets were activated by collagen , ADP or thrombin-activation peptide . The platelet-EPC interaction was inhibited by antibodies to P16109 or P16109 glycoprotein ligand-1 ( Q14242 ) , but not by antibodies to glycoproteins Ib-IX-V or IIb/IIIa . When perfused over activated platelets under shear stress of 2.5 dyn/cm(2) , EPCs tethered to platelayers and either adhered immediately or rolled a short distance before adhering . In addition , platelets promoted the colonization of adherent EPCs in culture conditions . Consistent with recent animal studies , these findings demonstrate that human EPCs interact in vitro with activated platelets under static and flow conditions , mediated through P16109 - Q14242 interaction . This interaction may be a central mechanism for homing of EPCs to vascular injury sites . Order of genes on human chromosome 5q with respect to 5q interstitial deletions . Using ( a ) somatic cell hybrids retaining partial chromosome 5 and ( b ) clinical samples from patients with acquired deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 , combined with chromosome 5-linked DNA probes , some of which exhibited RFLPs , we have determined the order of a series of genes on chromosome 5 . The order established is 5pter ---- MLVI-2 ---- cen ---- P07686 ---- P00374 ---- Pi227- --- cp12.6 ---- ( P05113 , P05112 ) ---- P08700 ---- P04141 ---- P05230 ---- ( P07333 , P09619 ) ---- ( treC,ADRBR ) ---- ( Q5SW96 - Q13585 , P09603 ) ---- qter . The suggested order and orientation for the closely linked P08700 / P04141 gene pair is cen ---- 5' P08700 3' ---- 5' P04141 3' ---- qter , on the basis of analysis of the P04141 rearrangement in HL60 DNA . The map position of the GRL locus , which was consistent with both somatic cell hybrid and 5q- analyses , was telomeric to P04141 and centromeric to P07333 / P09619 , near P05230 . Long-range restriction-enzyme analysis of 5q- DNAs did not detect rearrangements of 5q-linked probes except in HL60 DNA , but it did reveal putative long-range RFLPs of several loci . RFLPs for GRL , Pi227 , cp12.6 , P08700 , and P07333 can detect deletions in bone marrow and in leukemia cells from patients with acquired 5q deletions . Toxicity of sorafenib : clinical and molecular aspects . IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD : DB00398 is a novel oral bis-aryl urea compound originally developed as an inhibitor of RAF kinase for its anti-proliferative property . DB00398 also inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases of multiple pro-angiogenic factors such as P17948 /2/3 , Flt-3 and P09619 . The combination of both its anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties makes sorafenib an attractive agent in cancer treatment . DB00398 has been approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma as well as hepatocellular cancer . Despite its inherent selectivity , sorafenib can cause unusual adverse events whose the management represents a challenge for oncologists . AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW : Relevant literature was identified using a Pubmed search of articles published up to June 2009 . Search terms included ' sorafenib ' and ' toxicity ' . Original articles were reviewed and relevant citations from these articles were also considered . WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN : The clinical aspect of sorafenib-induced adverse events and the molecular basis behind this toxicity are discussed . Finally , recommendations for the management of these adverse events are proposed . TAKE HOME MESSAGE : Although not life-threatening , toxicity of sorafenib can severely impact the physical , psychological and social well-being of patients . The management of this unusual toxicity highlights the particular need of new pluridisciplinarities linking oncologist , cardiologist and dermatologist . M4 and M5 acute myeloid leukaemias display a high sensitivity to DB00188 -mediated apoptosis . The present study explored the sensitivity of leukaemic blasts derived from 30 acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) patients to DB00188 . DB00188 induced apoptosis of primary AML blasts : 18/30 AMLs were clearly sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of DB00188 , while the remaining cases were moderately sensitive to this molecule . The addition of tumour necrosis factor-related-apoptosis-inducing ligand , when used alone , did not induce apoptosis of AML blasts and further potentiated the cytotoxic effects of DB00188 . The majority of AMLs sensitive to DB00188 showed immunophenotypic features of the M4 and M5 French-American-British classification subtypes and displayed myelomonocytic features . All AMLs with mutated P36888 were in the DB00188 -sensitive group . Biochemical studies showed that : ( i ) DB00188 activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 and decreased cellular Q14790 [ Fas-associated death domain ( Q13158 ) -like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme ] -inhibitory protein ( O15519 ) levels in AML blasts ; ( ii ) high O15519 levels in AML blasts were associated with low DB00188 sensitivity . Finally , analysis of the effects of DB00188 on leukaemic cells displaying high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity suggested that this drug induced in vitro killing of leukaemic stem cells . The findings of the present study , further support the development of DB00188 as an anti-leukaemic drug and provide simple tools to predict the sensitivity of AML cells to this drug . DB00398 treatment of P36888 -ITD(+) acute myeloid leukemia : favorable initial outcome and mechanisms of subsequent nonresponsiveness associated with the emergence of a D835 mutation . Internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) of the fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 ( P36888 ) gene occurs in 30 % of acute myeloid leukemias ( AMLs ) and confers a poor prognosis . Thirteen relapsed or chemo-refractory P36888 -ITD(+) AML patients were treated with sorafenib ( 200-400 mg twice daily ) . Twelve patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 ( range 21-84 ) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells . The sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 ( range 54-287 ) days but the P36888 and downstream effectors remained suppressed . Gene expression profiling showed that leukemia cells that have become sorafenib resistant expressed several genes including P00352 , P52333 , and P51511 , whose functions were unknown in AML . Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice transplanted with leukemia cells from patients before and during sorafenib resistance recapitulated the clinical results . Both ITD and tyrosine kinase domain mutations at D835 were identified in leukemia initiating cells ( LICs ) from samples before sorafenib treatment . LICs bearing the D835 mutant have expanded during sorafenib treatment and dominated during the subsequent clinical resistance . These results suggest that sorafenib have selected more aggressive sorafenib-resistant subclones carrying both P36888 -ITD and D835 mutations , and might provide important leads to further improvement of treatment outcome with P36888 inhibitors . Dopamine modulating drugs influence striatal (+)-[11C]DTBZ binding in rats : Q05940 binding is sensitive to changes in vesicular dopamine concentration . Binding of (+)-[11C]DTBZ ( dihydrotetrabenazine ) to the striatal vesicular monoamine transporter ( Q05940 ) is widely considered to be a stable marker of dopamine neurone integrity . However , we now find that specific binding of a tracer dose of (+)-[11C]DTBZ is modestly increased in rat striatum following dopamine depletion with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine ( alpha-MPT , +14 % ) or DB01576 ( d- P49418 , 20 mg/kg , +12 % ) and decreased following dopamine elevation with gamma-hydroxybutyrate ( DB01440 , -16 % ) or levodopa ( -20 % ) . We suggest that in vivo (+)-[11C]DTBZ binding in imaging studies is subject to competition by vesicular dopamine and , in this respect , is not a " stable " dopamine biomarker as is generally assumed . [ Cytoprotective and antiangiogenic effects of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib on human retinal pigmentepithelium ] . BACKGROUND : Cumulative light exposure is significantly associated with progression of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor A ( P15692 ) is the main target of current antiangiogenic treatment strategies for AMD . Previous reports indicated that sorafenib , an oral multikinase inhibitor , might have beneficial effects on exudative AMD . This study investigates the effects of sorafenib on light-induced overexpression of P15692 and its receptors P17948 and 2 in human retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells . METHODS : The effects of sorafenib on P17948 and 2 expression of primary human Q96AT9 cells was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , immunohistochemistry and western blotting . In addition , Q96AT9 cells were exposed to white light and incubated with sorafenib . Viability , expression of P15692 and its mRNA were determined by RT-PCR , immunohistochemistry , western blotting , and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays . RESULTS : DB00398 reduced P17948 and 2 expression of Q96AT9 cells . Light exposure decreased cell viability and increased expression and secretion of P15692 . These light-induced effects were significantly reduced when cells were treated with sorafenib at a dose of 1 µg/ml . CONCLUSION : The results show that sorafenib has promising properties as a potential antiangiogenic treatment for AMD . Novel Q02750 mutation identified by mutational analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway genes in lung adenocarcinoma . Genetic lesions affecting a number of kinases and other elements within the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) signaling pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . We performed mutational profiling of a large cohort of lung adenocarcinomas to uncover other potential somatic mutations in genes of this pathway that could contribute to lung tumorigenesis . We have identified in 2 of 207 primary lung tumors a somatic activating mutation in exon 2 of Q02750 ( i.e. , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 or Q02750 ) that substitutes asparagine for lysine at amino acid 57 ( K57N ) in the nonkinase portion of the kinase . Neither of these two tumors harbored known mutations in other genes encoding components of the P00533 signaling pathway ( i.e. , P00533 , P04626 , P01116 , P42336 , and P15056 ) . Expression of mutant , but not wild-type , Q02750 leads to constitutive activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) -1/2 in human 293T cells and to growth factor-independent proliferation of murine Ba/ P13726 cells . A selective MEK inhibitor , AZD6244 , inhibits mutant-induced P29323 activity in 293T cells and growth of mutant-bearing Ba/ P13726 cells . We also screened 85 NSCLC cell lines for Q02750 exon 2 mutations ; one line ( NCI-H1437 ) harbors a Q56P substitution , a known transformation-competent allele of Q02750 originally identified in rat fibroblasts , and is sensitive to treatment with AZD6244 . Q02750 mutants have not previously been reported in lung cancer and may provide a target for effective therapy in a small subset of patients with lung adenocarcinoma . Procyanidin induces apoptosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma cells via JNK activation of c-Jun . Procyanidins are polymeric flavanols found in fruits and vegetables and have shown anticarcinogenic/chemopreventive properties . We previously showed that oligomeric procyanidin extracted from apples induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma ( OA ) cells . To understand the mechanism of action , we determined transcriptomic changes induced by procyanidin in OA cells . Pathway analysis implicated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in eliciting these responses . Procyanidin induced the activation of JNK and p38 and the phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun . Inhibition of JNK but not p38 kinase activity prevented the procyanidin-induced phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun . Knockdown of the expression of P45983 , P45984 , or P05412 diminished procyanidin-induced effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis . c-Jun is a component of the transcription factor AP-1 and AP-1 binding sites are overrepresented in the promoters of procyanidin-induced genes . This indicates that JNK activation of c-Jun by procyanidin leads to the induction of apoptosis of OA cells and suggests a role for a c-Jun-mediated transcriptional program . These data provide a mechanistic understanding of how procyanidin specifically targets a distinct pathway involved in the induction of apoptosis in OA cells and will inform future studies investigating its use as a chemopreventive/therapeutic agent . P10721 -D816 mutations in Q01196 - Q06455 -positive AML are associated with impaired event-free and overall survival . Mutations in codon D816 of the P10721 gene represent a recurrent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . To clarify the biologic implication of activation loop mutations of the P10721 gene , 1940 randomly selected AML patients were analyzed . In total , 33 ( 1.7 % ) of 1940 patients were positive for D816 mutations . Of these 33 patients , 8 ( 24.2 % ) had a t(8;21) , which was significantly higher compared with the subgroup without D816 mutations . Analyses of genetic subgroups showed that P10721 -D816 mutations were associated with t(8;21)/ Q01196 - Q06455 and other rare Q01196 translocations . In contrast , other activating mutations like P36888 and P01111 mutations were very rarely detected in Q01196 -rearranged leukemia . P10721 mutations had an independent negative impact on overall ( median 304 vs 1836 days ; P = .006 ) and event-free survival ( median 244 vs 744 days ; P = .003 ) in patients with t(8;21) but not in patients with a normal karyotype . The P10721 -D816V receptor expressed in Ba/ P13726 cells was resistant to growth inhibition by the selective PTK inhibitors imatinib and SU5614 but fully sensitive to PKC412 . Our findings clearly indicate that activating mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases are associated with distinct genetic subtypes in AML . The P10721 -D816 mutations confer a poor prognosis to Q01196 - Q06455 -positive AML and should therefore be included in the diagnostic workup . Patients with P10721 -D816-positive/ Q01196 - Q06455 -positive AML might benefit from early intensification of treatment or combination of conventional chemotherapy with P10721 PTK inhibitors . DB01016 exerts an antitumor activity through reactive oxygen species-c-jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway in human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 . DB01016 , a blocker of DB00171 -sensitive potassium ( K( DB00171 ) ) channels , can suppress progression of many cancers , but the involved mechanism is unclear . Herein we reported that MGC-803 cells expressed the K( DB00171 ) channels composed of Kir6.2 and Q09428 subunits . DB01016 induced cellular viability decline , coupled with cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation in MGC-803 cells . Meanwhile , glibenclamide increased NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit gp91(phox) expression and superoxide anion ( O2- ) generation , and caused mitochondrial respiration dysfunction in MGC-803 cells , suggesting that glibenclamide induced an increase of ROS derived from NADPH oxidase and mitochondria . DB01016 could also lead to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential , release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor ( O95831 ) , and activation of c-jun NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) in MGC-803 cells . Pretreatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine ( Q9C000 ) prevented glibenclamide-induced JNK activation , apoptosis and cellular viability decline . Furthermore , glibenclamide greatly decreased the cellular viability , induced apoptosis and inhibited Akt activation in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cells but not in P45983 -/- or P45984 -/- MEF cells . Taken together , our study reveals that glibenclamide exerts an antitumor activity in MGC-803 cells by activating ROS-dependent , JNK-driven cell apoptosis . These findings provide insights into the use of glibenclamide in the treatment of human gastric cancer . P07332 kinase promotes mast cell recruitment to mammary tumors via the stem cell factor/ P10721 receptor signaling axis . P10721 receptor is required for mast cell development , survival , and migration toward its ligand stem cell factor ( P21583 ) . Many solid tumors express P21583 and this leads to mast cell recruitment to tumors and release of mediators linked to tumor angiogenesis , growth , and metastasis . Here , we investigate whether P07332 protein-tyrosine kinase , a downstream effector of P10721 signaling in mast cells , is required for migration of mast cells toward P21583 -expressing mammary tumors . Using a novel agarose drop assay for chemotaxis of bone marrow-derived mast cells ( BMMC ) toward P21583 , we found that defects in chemotaxis of fes-null BMMCs correlated with disorganized microtubule networks in polarized cells . P07332 displayed partial colocalization with microtubules in polarized BMMCs and has at least two direct microtubule binding sites within its N-terminal F-BAR and SH2 domains . An oligomerization-disrupting mutation within the Fer/ Q15642 homology-Bin/ P49418 /Rvs ( F-BAR ) domain had no effect on microtubule binding , whereas microtubule binding to the SH2 domain was dependent on the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket . P07332 involvement in mast cell recruitment to tumors was tested using the AC2M2 mouse mammary carcinoma model . These tumor cells expressed P21583 and promoted BMMC recruitment in a P10721 - and P07332 -dependent manner . Engraftment of AC2M2 orthotopic and subcutaneous tumors in control or fes-null mice , revealed a key role for P07332 in recruitment of mast cells to the tumor periphery . This may contribute to the reduced tumor growth and metastases observed in fes-null mice compared with control mice . Taken together , P07332 is a potential therapeutic target to limit the progression of tumors with stromal mast cell involvement . Transforming growth factor alpha-induced expression of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor in astrocytes rescues neurons from excitotoxicity . Although transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -alpha , a member of the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) family , has been shown to protect neurons against excitotoxic and ischemic brain injuries , its mechanism of action remains unknown . In the present study , we used in vitro models of apoptotic or necrotic paradigms demonstrating that TGF-alpha rescues neurons from N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) -induced excitotoxic death , with the obligatory presence of astrocytes . Because neuronal tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) release was shown to potentiate DB01221 -induced excitotoxicity , we observed that TGF-alpha treatment reduced DB01221 -induced increase of t-PA activity in mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes . In addition , we showed that although TGF-alpha induces activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERKs ) in astrocytes , it failed to activate Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 in neurons . Finally , we showed that TGF-alpha , by an P29323 -dependent mechanism , stimulates the astrocytic expression of P05121 , a t-PA inhibitor , which mediates the neuroprotective activity of TGF-alpha against DB01221 -mediated excitotoxic neuronal death . Taken together , we indicate that TGF-alpha rescues neurons from DB01221 -induced excitotoxicity in mixed cultures through inhibition of t-PA activity , involving P05121 overexpression by an P29323 -dependent pathway in astrocytes . [ Angiogenesis and renal cell carcinoma ] . Developments in the knowledge of molecular biology of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) over the past 20 years have been identified . Angiogenesis is playing a key role in the physiopathology of RCC . Von Hippel-Lindau ( P40337 ) alterations , HIFalpha accumulation and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) overexpression are important mediators of this process . Several stategies have been developped to target angiogenesis for the treatment of metastatic RCC . These include inhibition of P15692 receptors ( inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity ) or binding to the P15692 protein . Several additional kinases inhibitions including PDGF receptors are also targeted . DB01268 ( SU11248 ) is an orally biovailable small molecule that has demonstrated superiority over interferon-alpha for the treatment of metastatic RCC . In a recent randomized phase III study conducted in 750 patients , the response rate to sunitinib was 31 % and to interferon 6 % . The median of progression free survival ( PFS ) was 11 months for sunitinib and 5 months for interferon ( p < 0.001 ) . DB00398 ( BAY43-9006 ) was found to inhibit Raf1 , but also P35968 and 3 , Flt3 , P09619 -a and b and c-kit , has been tested in a phase III study against placebo after one prior systemic therapy . The median of the time to progression ( TTP ) for sorafenib was 24 weeks versus 12 weeks for patients in the placebo arm ( p = 0,01 ) . Other molecules tested in metastatic RCC will be presented including axitinib , pazopanib and bevacizumab . Cbl-b is a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokines produced by IgE-activated mast cells . c-Cbl and Cbl-b E3 ubiquitin ligases are abundantly expressed in hemopoietic cells where they negatively regulate the activity and levels of many cell surface receptors and associated signaling molecules . By comparing bone marrow-derived mast cells from c-Cbl and Cbl-b-deficient mice it has recently been shown that Cbl-b is the dominant family member for negatively regulating signaling responses from high-affinity IgE receptors . In this study , we suggest that a possible reason for the greater enhancement of IgE receptor signaling in Cbl-b-deficient mice is the relatively higher levels of Cbl-b protein over c-Cbl in mast cells compared with other hemopoietic cells . We also directly compare mast cells from c-Cbl and Cbl-b-deficient mice and find that loss of Cbl-b , but not c-Cbl , increases cell growth , retards receptor internalization , and causes the sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and its substrates . However , loss of Cbl-b does not enhance the activation of P29323 or Akt , nor does it promote a greater calcium response . Furthermore , loss of Cbl-b or c-Cbl does not increase levels of the Syk or Lyn protein tyrosine kinases . Most notable , however , is the extremely large increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines P01375 , P05231 , and P13500 by Cbl-b(-/-) mast cells compared with levels produced by c-Cbl(-/-) or wild-type cells . This marked induction , which appears to be restricted to these three cytokines , is dependent on IgE receptor activation and correlates with enhanced O15111 phosphorylation . Thus , Cbl-b functions as a potent negative regulator of cytokines that promote allergic and inflammatory reactions . Suppression of P05121 expression through inhibition of the P00533 -mediated signaling cascade in rat kidney fibroblast by ascofuranone . Fibrosis in glomerulosclerosis causes progressive loss of renal function . Transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta , one of the major profibrotic cytokines , induces the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) -1 , a factor that plays a crucial role in the development of fibrosis . Here , we found that an isoprenoid antibiotic , ascofuranone , suppresses expression of profibrotic factors including matrix proteins and P05121 induced by TGF-beta in renal fibroblasts . Ascofuranone selectively inhibits phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , and downstream kinases such as P04049 , MEK-1/2 , and P27361 /2 . P05121 transcription also is suppressed by treatment with kinase inhibitors for MEK-1/2 or P00533 , and with small interfering RNA for P00533 . Ascofuranone inhibits cellular metalloproteinase activity , and an inhibitor of metalloproteinases suppresses P00533 phosphorylation and P05121 transcription . These results suggest that ascofuranone suppresses expression of profibrotic factors through the inhibition of an P00533 -dependent signal transduction pathway activated by metalloproteinases . DB00398 as treatment for relapsed or refractory pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia . The prognosis for children with acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) has improved with overall survival rates of up to 65 % [ Pui et al. J Clin Oncol 2011 ; 29 : 551-565 ] . However , the cure rate for AML lags behind that of acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Advances in AML leukemogenesis are leading to refined risk stratification . P07333 like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) mutations are independently associated with a poor prognosis . Newer kinase inhibitors , including sorafenib , have shown promise in adult studies . We report three pediatric patients with relapsed AML who achieved a sustained remission with sorafenib . Further trials are necessary to understand the role of sorafenib in pediatric AML . DB00398 does not improve efficacy of chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer : A GISCAD randomized phase II study . BACKGROUND : The RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway is commonly activated in pancreatic cancer because of a high frequency of P01116 - P15056 mutations . A phase II randomized trial was designed to investigate the activity of sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer . METHODS : Locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive cisplatin plus gemcitabine with sorafenib 400mg bid ( arm A ) or without sorafenib ( arm B ) . RESULTS : One hundred and fourteen patients were enrolled ; of these , 43 ( 74.6 % ) patients progressed in arm A and 44 ( 82.4 % ) in arm B . Median progression-free survival was 4.3 months ( 95 % CI : 2.7-6.5 ) and 4.5 months ( 95 % CI : 2.5-5.2 ) , respectively ( HR=0.92 ; 95 % CI : 0.62-1.35 ) . Median overall survival was 7.5 ( 95 % CI : 5.6-9.7 ) and 8.3 months ( 95 % CI : 6.2-8.7 ) , respectively ( HR=0.95 ; 95 % CI : 0.62-1.48 ) . Response rates were 3.4 % in arm A and 3.6 % in arm B . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 does not significantly enhance activity of chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer patients , and therefore should not be assessed in phase III trials . 5-Azacitidine restores and amplifies the bicalutamide response on preclinical models of androgen receptor expressing or deficient prostate tumors . BACKGROUND : Epigenetic modifications play a key role in the in prostate cancer ( Pca ) progression to a hormone refractory state ( HRPC ) and the current use of agents targeting epigenetic changes has become a topic of intense interest in cancer research . In this regard , 5-Azacitine ( 5-Aza ) represents a promising epigenetic modulator . This study tested the hypothesis that 5-Aza may restore and enhance the responsiveness of HRPC cells to anti-hormonal therapy on P10275 ( AR ) expressing ( 22rv1 ) and AR-deficient ( PC3 ) cells . METHODS : The effects were studied in vitro and in vivo models . This sequential treatment induced in vitro cell cycle arrest and apoptosis both in 22rv1 and PC3 tumor cell lines . RESULTS : This combined treatment up-regulated the expression of P48023 , phospho- Q13158 , p16(INKA) , Bax , Bak , and P38936 ( P38936 ) , and inhibited FLIP , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-XL expression . The re-activation of hormonal response of AR-negative PC3 cell line was partially due to the AR re-expression mediated by 5-Aza treatment . In contrast , the increase in the response to anti-androgenic therapy in 22rv1 did not correlate with AR expression levels . Furthermore , xenograft studies revealed that the combined treatment of 5-Aza with AR-antagonist DB01128 had additive/synergistic effects in repressing tumor growth in vivo and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects seem to be in part mediated by induction of apoptosis . CONCLUSIONS : So , this study strongly suggests a therapeutic potential of 5-Aza in combination with anti-androgen therapy in patients with in AR expressing and AR-deficient HRPC . [ DB00398 in combination with chemotherapy in the induction therapy for P36888 -ITD positive acute monocytic leukemia : a case report and literature review ] . OBJECTIVE : To explore the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of P36888 positive acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , to highlight the impact of P36888 mutations and targeting therapy on response of AML . METHODS : The clinical and laboratory features and the treatment response , especially the safety profile of sorafenib in an acute monocytic leukemia patient with P17948 -ITD were reported . RESULTS : The patient achieved clinical and molecular CR after sorafenib was added to the second course of combination chemotherapy . The side effects of sorafenib were mild and tolerable . CONCLUSION : The patient responded well to the combination of sorafenib and standard chemotherapy of AML without significant adverse effects . Resistance to killing by tumor necrosis factor in an adipocyte cell line caused by a defect in arachidonic acid biosynthesis . We have found that Q96RJ0 -R6 , which are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) in the presence of cycloheximide ( Reid , T. R. , Torti , F. , and Ringold , G. M. ( 1989 ) J. Biol. Chem. 264 , 4583-4589 ) , have reduced ability to release arachidonic acid ( 20:4 ) from membrane phospholipids in response to either P01375 or the calcium ionophore A23187 treatment . However , no defect in the activity of phospholipase A2 , the principal enzyme responsible for the release of 20:4 from phospholipids , was observed in these cells . Detailed biochemical characterization of these P01375 -resistant cells has revealed that these cells are unable to synthesize 20:4 endogenously because of a defect in delta 6-desaturase , the rate-limiting enzyme of 20:4 biosynthesis . This deficiency leads to a marked decrease in the steady-state levels of 20:4 present in choline-containing phospholipid ( PC ) and ethanolamine-containing phospholipid ( PE ) . The Q96RJ0 -R6 cells , however , are capable of incorporating exogenous 20:4 into PC and PE , and when loaded in such manner they become significantly more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of P01375 in the presence of cycloheximide . Therefore , the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids appears to be a critical element in the signaling pathway utilized by P01375 and is essential to the rapid cytotoxic response elicited by P01375 in the absence of protein synthesis in wild-type Q96RJ0 cells . Multiple mechanisms mediate resistance to sorafenib in urothelial cancer . Genetic and epigenetic changes in the mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling render urothelial cancer a potential target for tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) treatment . However , clinical trials of several TKIs failed to prove efficacy . In this context , we investigated changes in MAPK signaling activity , downstream apoptotic regulators and changes in cell cycle distribution in different urothelial cancer cell lines ( UCCs ) upon treatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib . None of the classical sorafenib targets ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/-receptor 2 , P17948 /-R2 ; platelet-derived growth factor receptor α/-receptor β , P09619 -α/-β ; c- P10721 ) was expressed at significant levels leaving RAF proteins as its likely molecular target . Low sorafenib concentrations paradoxically increased cell viability , whereas higher concentrations induced P55008 arrest and eventually apoptosis . MAPK signaling remained partly active after sorafenib treatment , especially in T24 cells with an oncogenic P01112 mutation . AKT phosphorylation was increased , suggesting compensatory activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway . DB00398 regularly down regulated the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 ( Mcl-1 ) protein , but combinatorial treatment with ABT-737 targeting other B-cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ) family proteins did not result in synergistic effects . In summary , efficacy of sorafenib in urothelial cancer cell lines appears hampered by limited effects on MAPK signaling , crosstalk with further cancer pathways and an anti-apoptotic state of UCCs . These observations may account for the lack of efficacy of sorafenib in clinical trials and should be considered more broadly in the development of signaling pathway inhibitors for drug therapy in urothelial carcinoma . Regulation of gene expression in melanoma : new approaches for treatment . The molecular changes associated with the transition of melanoma cells from radial growth phase ( RGP ) to vertical growth phase ( VGP , metastatic phenotype ) are not yet well defined . We have demonstrated that the progression of human melanoma is associated with loss of expression of the transcription factor P05549 . In metastatic melanoma cells , this loss resulted in overexpression of P43121 / P43121 , P08253 , the thrombin receptor ( P25116 ) , and lack of c- P10721 expression . The transition from RGP to VGP is also associated with overexpression of the angiogenic factor P10145 . Additionally , the transition of melanoma cells from RGP to VGP is associated with overexpression of the transcription factors CREB and P39905 -1 , both of which may act as survival factors for human melanoma cells . Inactivation of CREB/ P39905 -1 activities in metastatic melanoma cells by dominant-negative CREB or by anti- P39905 -1 single chain antibody fragment ( ScFv ) , resulted in deregulation of P08253 and P43121 / P43121 , increased the sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis , and inhibition of their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in vivo . In this prospect article , we summarize our data on the role of P05549 and CREB/ P39905 -1 in the progression of human melanoma and report on the development of new fully human antibodies anti- P43121 / P43121 and anti- P10145 which could serve as new modalities for the treatment of melanoma . DB00398 : targeting multiple tyrosine kinases in cancer . DB00398 ( BAY 43-9006 , Nexavar® ) is an oral multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Main targets are receptor tyrosine kinase pathways frequently deregulated in cancer such as the Raf-Ras pathway , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) pathway , and P07333 -like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) . DB00398 was approved by the FDA in fast track for advanced renal cell cancer and hepatocellular cancer and shows good clinical activity in thyroid cancer . Multiple clinical trials are undertaken to further investigate the role of sorafenib alone or in combination for the treatment of various tumor entities . DB09301 glycosaminoglycans as major P16109 ligands on metastatic breast cancer cell lines . The metastatic breast cancer cell line , 4T1 , abundantly expresses the oligosaccharide sialylated Lewis x ( sLe(x) ) . SLe(x) oligosaccharide on tumor cells can be recognized by E- and P16109 , contributing to tumor metastatic process . We observed that both selectins reacted with this cell line . However , contrary to the P16581 reactivity , which was sLe(x) dependent , P16109 reactivity with this cell line was sLe(x)-independent . The sLe(x)-Neg variant of the 4T1 cell line with markedly diminished expression of sLe(x) and lack of sLe(a) , provided a unique opportunity to characterize P16109 ligands and their contribution to metastasis in the absence of overlapping selectin ligands and P16581 binding . We observed that P16109 binding was Ca(2+)-independent and sulfation-dependent . We found that P16109 reacted primarily with cell surface chondroitin sulfate ( CS ) proteoglycans , which were abundantly and stably expressed on the surface of the 4T1 cell line . P16109 binding to the 4T1 cells was inhibited by heparin and CS glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) . Moreover , DB01109 administration significantly inhibited experimental lung metastasis . In addition , the data suggest that surface CS GAG chains were involved in P16109 mediated adhesion of the 4T1 cells to murine platelets and human umbilical vein endothelial cells . The data suggest that CS GAGs are also the major P16109 -reactive ligands on the surface of human MDA-MET cells . The results warrant conducting clinical studies on the involvement of cell surface CS chains in breast cancer metastasis and evaluation of various CS types and their biosynthetic pathways as target for development of treatment strategies for antimetastatic therapy of this disease . Peripheral medulloepithelioma : a rare tumor with a potential target therapy . BACKGROUND : Medulloepithelioma ( ME ) is a rare embryonal tumor predominantly located in the eye or in the central nervous system without an established treatment . CASE PRESENTATION : We report of a case of a localized peripheral ME treated with conventional and high dose chemotherapy , surgery and local radiotherapy . At relapse , the tumor tissue revealed a different molecular signature compared to the initial tumor mass . This molecular signature revealed a high expression of platelet derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) . DB00398 plus irinotecan and temozolomide was started with a 5 month progression free survival . CONCLUSION : Our experience suggests a possible role of sorafenib or different P09619 inhibitors in ME . Targeting treatment could represent an adjuvant and/or alternative therapy for ME and other rare tumors . Iodide- and glucose-handling gene expression regulated by sorafenib or cabozantinib in papillary thyroid cancer . CONTEXT : The aberrant silencing of iodide-handling genes accompanied by up-regulation of glucose metabolism presents a major challenge for radioiodine treatment of papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) . OBJECTIVE : This study aimed to evaluate the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on iodide-handling and glucose-handling gene expression in BHP 2-7 cells harboring P07949 / Q13635 rearrangement . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : In this in vitro study , the effects of sorafenib or cabozantinib on cell growth , cycles , and apoptosis were investigated by cell proliferation assay , cell cycle analysis , and P08758 -FITC apoptosis assay , respectively . The effect of both agents on signal transduction pathways was evaluated using the Western blot . Quantitative real-time PCR , Western blot , immunofluorescence , and radioisotope uptake assays were used to assess iodide-handling and glucose-handling gene expression . RESULTS : Both compounds inhibited cell proliferation in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner and caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/ P55008 phase . DB00398 blocked P07949 , AKT , and P27361 /2 phosphorylation , whereas cabozantinib blocked P07949 and AKT phosphorylation . The restoration of iodide-handling gene expression and inhibition of glucose transporter 1 and 3 expression could be induced by either drug . The robust expression of sodium/iodide symporter induced by either agent was confirmed , and (125)I uptake was correspondingly enhanced . (18)F- DB09150 accumulation was significantly decreased after treatment by either sorafenib or cabozantinib . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 and cabozantinib had marked effects on cell proliferation , cell cycle arrest , and signal transduction pathways in PTC cells harboring P07949 / Q13635 rearrangement . Both agents could be potentially used to enhance the expression of iodide-handling genes and inhibit the expression of glucose transporter genes . Suppression of androgen receptor-mediated gene expression by a sequence-specific DNA-binding polyamide . P10275 ( AR ) is essential for the growth and progression of prostate cancer in both hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory disease . A DNA-binding polyamide that targets the consensus androgen response element binds the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) promoter androgen response element , inhibits androgen-induced expression of PSA and several other AR-regulated genes in cultured prostate cancer cells , and reduces AR occupancy at the PSA promoter and enhancer . Down-regulation of PSA by this polyamide was comparable to that produced by the synthetic antiandrogen bicalutamide ( DB01128 ) at the same concentration . Genome-wide expression analysis reveals that a similar number of transcripts are affected by treatment with the polyamide and with bicalutamide . Direct inhibition of the AR-DNA interface by sequence-specific DNA binding small molecules could offer an alternative approach to antagonizing AR activity . DB00398 in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors who failed two or more prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors : a phase II study of Korean gastrointestinal stromal tumors study group . PURPOSE : To evaluated the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) who failed to previous standard treatments . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Thirty-one patients with measurable metastatic GIST who failed both imatinib and sunitinib were accrued . DB00398 was administered orally at 400 mg twice daily until disease progression or development of intolerance . The primary endpoint was disease control rate ( response + stable disease , DCR ) at 24 weeks . RESULTS : DB00398 was well tolerated , with hand-foot skin reaction , fatigue , hypertension , and abdominal pain being the most frequent adverse events . The relative dose intensity of sorafenib during the first 6 months was > 80 % . Four patients achieved partial response ( response rate 13 % , 95 % CI 1-25 % ) , and 16 ( 52 % ) had stable disease . DCR at 24 weeks was measured as 36 % ( 95 % CI 19-52 % ) . Median progression-free and overall survivals were 4.9 and 9.7 months , respectively . Progression-free survival of patients with prior use of nilotinib ( P = .0085 ) and with primary genotypes other than P10721 exon 11 mutation ( P = .0341 ) was significantly shorter than that of patients without . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 showed antitumor activity in this population of imatinib and sunitinib pretreated GIST . With sorafenib , about one third of patients can maintain disease control for more than 24 weeks . DB00398 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma across geographic regions . DB00398 is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting Raf , P15692 receptor , PDGF receptor , c-kit , Flt-3 and rearranged during transfection ( P07949 ) . Two randomized , placebo-controlled trials for Western and Asian patients , respectively , demonstrated that sorafenib significantly prolongs overall survival and time to progression in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . These have become the reference treatment for future clinical trials of advanced HCC . DB00398 is well tolerated in patients with Child-Pugh liver function class A , but limited data are available in Child-Pugh class B and C patients . Clinical trials are ongoing to test the efficacy of sorafenib-based combination therapy and sorafenib adjuvant therapy for HCC . DB00398 ( Nexavar ) induces molecular remission and regression of extramedullary disease in a patient with P36888 -ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia . The fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication ( P36888 -ITD ) can be found in about one quarter of patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) [ Small D. P36888 mutations : biology and treatment. Hematology Am Soc Hematology. Educ. Program 2006;178-84 [ Review ] ] . Patients who carry this mutation have a high risk of relapse even after allogeneic stem cell transplantation [ Sheikhha MH , Awan A , Tobal K , Liu Yin JA . Prognostic significance of P36888 ITD and D835 mutations in AML patients. Hematol J 2003;4:41-6 ; Meshinchi S , Arceci RJ , Sanders JE , Smith FO , Woods WB , Radich JP , et al. Role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in P36888 /ITD-positive AML . Blood 2006;108(1):400-1 ] . Recent reports show that DB00398 , a multikinase inhibitor has significant activity against P36888 -ITD(+) blasts in vitro [ Auclair D , Miller D , Yatsula V , Pickett W , Carter C , Chang Y , et al. Antitumor activity of sorafenib in P36888 -driven leukemic cells. Leukemia 2007;21(3):439-45 ] . We here report the first clinical case of molecular remission induced by DB00398 in a patient with P36888 -ITD(+) AML and extramedullary disease after allogenic stem cell transplantation . The ability of sorafenib to inhibit oncogenic PDGFRbeta and P36888 mutants and overcome resistance to other small molecule inhibitors . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Activated tyrosine kinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute leukemia , and represent attractive targets for therapy . DB00398 ( BAY43-9006 , Nexavar ) is a small molecule B-RAF inhibitor that is used for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma , and has been shown to have activity against receptor tyrosine kinases from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) families . We investigated the efficacy of sorafenib at inhibiting mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFRbeta , P10721 , and P36888 , which are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies . DESIGN AND METHODS : We tested the effect of sorafenib on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells transformed by P41212 -PDGFRbeta , P36888 with an internal tandem duplication or D835Y point mutation , and the P10721 (D816V) mutant . The direct effect of sorafenib on the activity of these kinases and their downstream signaling was tested using phospho-specific antibodies . RESULTS : We show that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of P41212 -PDGFRbeta and P36888 mutants , including some of the mutants that confer resistance to PKC412 and other P36888 inhibitors . DB00398 induced a cell cycle block and apoptosis in the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13 , both expressing P36888 with an internal tandem duplication , whereas no effect was observed on four other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines . The imatinib-resistant P10721 (D816V) mutant , associated with systemic mastocytosis , was found to be resistant to sorafenib . INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS : These results warrant further clinical studies of sorafenib for the treatment of myeloid malignancies expressing activated forms of PDGFRbeta and P36888 . Augmentation of methamphetamine-induced behaviors in transgenic mice lacking the trace amine-associated receptor 1 . The trace amine-associated receptor 1 ( Q96RJ0 ) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is functionally activated by amphetamine-based psychostimulants , including amphetamine , methamphetamine and DB01454 . Previous studies have shown that in transgenic mice lacking the Q96RJ0 gene ( Q96RJ0 knockout ; KO ) a single injection of amphetamine can produce enhanced behavioral responses compared to responses evoked in wild-type ( WT ) mice . Further , the psychostimulant effects of cocaine can be diminished by selective activation of Q96RJ0 . These findings suggest that Q96RJ0 might be implicated in the rewarding properties of psychostimulants . To investigate the role of Q96RJ0 in the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse , the psychomotor stimulating effects of amphetamine and methamphetamine and the conditioned rewarding effects of methamphetamine and morphine were compared between WT and Q96RJ0 KO mice . In locomotor activity studies , both single and repeated exposure to DB01576 or methamphetamine generated significantly higher levels of total distance traveled in Q96RJ0 KO mice compared to WT mice . In conditioned place preference ( CPP ) studies , Q96RJ0 KO mice acquired methamphetamine-induced CPP earlier than WT mice and retained CPP longer during extinction training . In morphine-induced CPP , both WT and KO genotypes displayed similar levels of CPP . Results from locomotor activity studies suggest that Q96RJ0 may have a modulatory role in the behavioral sensitization to amphetamine-based psychostimulants . That methamphetamine-but not morphine-induced CPP was augmented in Q96RJ0 KO mice suggests a selective role of Q96RJ0 in the conditioned reinforcing effects of methamphetamine . Collectively , these findings provide support for a regulatory role of Q96RJ0 in methamphetamine signaling . [ New therapies targeting the genetic mutations responsible for different types of melanoma ] . A number of molecular alterations have been described for melanoma . Melanomas with P15056 mutations tend to be located in areas of intermittent sun exposure , whereas melanomas with P10721 mutations mostly appear in acral areas , the mucosas , and areas of chronic sun exposure . DB00398 , a P15056 inhibitor , has a cytostatic effect on most melanomas with mutations affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway , and is also capable of triggering apoptosis in a small subgroup of these melanomas . By inhibiting P10721 , imatinib has a cytostatic and cytotoxic effect on melanomas with P10721 mutations , and probably has the same effect on another subgroup of melanomas with other as yet imperfectly understood P10721 mutations . For therapy to be effective , agents should be selected according to the pathways associated with the genetic mutations present in the melanoma . DB00398 inhibits the angiogenesis and growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenografts in nude mice . Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( ATC ) remains one of the most lethal human cancers . We hypothesized that sorafenib , a multikinase inhibitor of the BRaf , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 , and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta kinase , would decrease tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic model of ATC . The in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib on ATC cell lines were examined . To study the in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic ATC tumors in nude mice , sorafenib was given p.o. at 40 or 80 mg/kg daily . Intratumoral effects were studied using immunohistochemical analysis . The effect of sorafenib on survival of the mice was also studied . DB00398 inhibited the in vitro proliferation of ATC cell lines . DB00398 also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis via the induction of endothelial apoptosis in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer . As result , the growth of orthotopic ATC xenografts was reduced and the survival of the test animals was improved . DB00398 exerts significant antitumor activity in an orthotopic xenograft model of ATC via a potent antiangiogenic effect . The antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib suggest that its use in clinical setting may not depend on the P15056 mutational status of thyroid tumors . Given the lack of curative options for patients with ATC , sorafenib warrants further study as a therapeutic agent against ATC . DB00107 alleviates the neuroendocrine and cytokine response to bacterial endotoxin in healthy men . DB00107 is a hormone and neurotransmitter found to have anti-inflammatory functions in rodents . Here we used experimental bacterial endotoxinemia to examine the role of exogenous oxytocin administration on innate immune responses in humans . Ten healthy men received , in a randomized , placebo-controlled , crossover design , placebo , oxytocin , LPS , and LPS + oxytocin . DB00107 treatment resulted in a transient or prolonged reduction of endotoxin-induced increases in plasma DB01285 , cortisol , procalcitonin , P01375 , IL-1 receptor antagonist , P05112 , P05231 , macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha , macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) , interferon-inducible protein 10 , and P15692 . In vitro , oxytocin had no impact on LPS effects in releasing P01375 , P05231 , and P13500 in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy human donors . In summary , oxytocin decreases the neuroendocrine and cytokine activation caused by bacterial endotoxin in men , possibly due to the pharmacological modulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway . DB00107 might be a candidate for the therapy of inflammatory diseases and conditions associated with high cytokine and P15692 levels . Functional and molecular characterization of ex vivo cultured epiretinal membrane cells from human proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Characterization of the cell surface marker phenotype of ex vivo cultured cells growing out of human fibrovascular epiretinal membranes ( fvERMs ) from proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) can give insight into their function in immunity , angiogenesis , and retinal detachment . FvERMs from uneventful vitrectomies due to PDR were cultured adherently ex vivo . Surface marker analysis , release of immunity- and angiogenesis-pathway-related factors upon P01375 α activation and measurement of the intracellular calcium dynamics upon mechano-stimulation using fluorescent dye Fura-2 were all performed . FvERMs formed proliferating cell monolayers when cultured ex vivo , which were negative for endothelial cell markers ( CD31 , P35968 ) , partially positive for hematopoietic- ( P28906 , Q08722 ) and mesenchymal stem cell markers ( CD73 , CD90/Thy-1 , and P09619 β ) , and negative for CD105 . CD146/ P43121 and CD166/ Q13740 , previously unreported in cells from fvERMs , were also expressed . Secretion of 11 angiogenesis-related factors ( DPPIV/ P27487 , P58294 / P30613 , ET-1 , P18065 and 3 , P10145 / P10145 , P13500 / P13500 , P14780 , PTX3/ P26022 , P05121 / P05121 , P36955 / P36955 , P01033 , and P07996 -1 ) were detected upon P01375 α activation of fvERM cells . Mechano-stimulation of these cells induced intracellular calcium propagation representing functional viability and role of these cells in tractional retinal detachment , thus serving as a model for studying tractional forces present in fvERMs in PDR ex vivo . DB06643 for joints and bones . DB06643 is an investigational , fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity and specificity for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) , a cytokine member of the tumor necrosis factor family . O14788 , an essential mediator of osteoclast formation , function , and survival , plays a major role in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis , structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis , and bone loss associated with other skeletal disorders . DB06643 suppresses bone turnover by inhibiting the action of O14788 on osteoclasts . DB06643 reduces bone turnover and increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density , reduces fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis , and inhibits structural damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis when added to ongoing methotrexate treatment . It is generally well tolerated , with a good safety profile . Adverse and serious adverse events , including infections and malignancy , are similar in patients treated with denosumab or placebo . DB00398 -associated remission of psoriasis in hypernephroma : case report . Psoriasis is a disease characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation that results in the formation of lesional plaques covered by scale . Psoriasis is thought to be angiogenesis dependent . Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a hypervascularized solid tumor associated with loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau ( P40337 ) tumor suppressor gene and increased P04049 activity . A 68-year-old man who suffered from recalcitrant psoriasis for over 50 years was treated with sorafenib for metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma . One month later , his psoriasis , previously 8 x 6 cm on the mid posterior thorax , completely resolved . DB00398 works by inhibiting several receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFR ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) ) . It also inhibits intracellular Raf kinase ( P04049 ) , which targets the ubiquitous mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) intracellular signal transduction pathway . We suggest that this patient 's remission of psoriasis could be related to the inhibition/modulation of P15692 , P09619 , P04049 , and MAPK . DB00398 tosylate as a radiosensitizer in malignant astrocytoma . Progress in research on the molecular aspects of glioblastoma has yet to provide a medical therapy that significantly improves prognosis . Glioblastoma invariably progress through current treatment regimens with radiotherapy as a key component . Activation of several signaling pathways is thought to be associated with this resistance to radiotherapy . Ras activity is exceptionally high in glioblastoma and may regulate sensitivity to radiotherapy . P04049 , a downstream effector of Ras , demonstrates a high amount of activity in glioblastoma . Therefore , P04049 inhibition should be considered as a mechanism to increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy in treatment regimen . In vitro analysis was performed with a novel P04049 kinase inhibitor ( BAY 54-9085 ) in culture with the glioblastoma cell line U1242 . The cell line was treated in serum-containing media and analyzed for the effect of the BAY 54-9085 alone and BAY 54-9085 combined with radiation on cell death . BAY 54-9085 displayed a cytocidal effect on glioblastoma cells following a 3 day incubation with the drug in serum-containing media . A dose of 2.5 μM displayed moderate cell death which significantly increased with a dose of 5.0 μM . In addition , glioblastoma cells treated with both the BAY 54-9085 and gamma radiation displayed a significant increase in cell death ( 85.5 % ) as compared to either BAY 54-9085 ( 73.1 % ) or radiation ( 34.4 % ) alone . Radiation therapy is a key component of treatment for glioblastoma . A novel P04049 inhibitor displayed in vitro evidence of synergistically increasing cell death of glioblastoma cells in combination with radiation . Prasugrel : a new antiplatelet drug for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease . Prasugrel , trade name DB06209 , is an investigational new antiplatelet drug currently under review for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration . It is a thienopyridine analog with a structure similar to that of clopidogrel and ticlopidine . Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate by irreversibly inhibiting the binding of adenosine diphosphate to the purinergic Q9H244 receptor on the platelet surface . Prasugrel has been shown to be a potent antiplatelet agent with a faster , more consistent , and greater inhibition of platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel . It is debatable , however , how effectively these pharmacologic benefits will translate to clinical benefits . The results of the large TRITON-TIMI 38 trial , which compared prasugrel and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were scheduled to receive coronary stents , demonstrated a significant reduction in ischemic events , including stent thrombosis , with prasugrel , but with an increased risk of major bleeding . The exact role of prasugrel in the management of ischemic heart disease is still being defined , but the risk:benefit ratio will likely play a major role in directing the best place for therapy with this new agent . Antifibrotic activity of sorafenib in experimental hepatic fibrosis : refinement of inhibitory targets , dosing , and window of efficacy in vivo . BACKGROUND : DB00398 , which is approved for treatment of HCC , has also shown promising antifibrotic activity , and therefore refinement of its dosing requirements and window of efficacy are important goals prior to antifibrotic clinical trials . AIM : The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal effective dose and optimal timing of sorafenib therapy in cultured human stellate cells and in rats with experimental hepatic fibrosis . METHODS : Effects of sorafenib were assessed in a human stellate cell line ( LX-2 ) . In vivo , rats were treated for 8 weeks with TAA three times per week ( 150 mg/kg IP ) , and with either PBS or sorafenib administered daily at doses of 1.25 , 5 or 7 mg/kg/day gavage either at the beginning of TAA administration for 8 weeks , during weeks 4-8 , or from weeks 8-12 . RESULTS : DB00398 treatment significantly inhibited LX-2 proliferation by > 75 % ( 7.5 or 15 μM ) . Treatment with 7.5-μM sorafenib for 12 h markedly inhibited expression of TGFβ1 , P01033 , collagen I , and P08253 mRNAs , but not of β- P09619 or type I TGFβR . In vivo , sorafenib significantly inhibited liver fibrosis when started concurrently with TAA and during weeks 4-8 with TAA . In contrast , there was no significant effect of sorafenib on fibrogenic gene expression or fibrosis when begun after cirrhosis was already established . CONCLUSION : DB00398 is anti-proliferative and antifibrotic towards human HSCs in culture , and is a potent antifibrotic agent in TAA-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats . The drug is effective at relatively low doses at the early stage of liver fibrosis , but is not effective when cirrhosis is already established . P25116 genotype influences platelet aggregation and procoagulant responses in patients with coronary artery disease prior to and during clopidogrel therapy . Genetic variations of the protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) have been associated with platelet receptor density and linked to thrombin receptor-activating peptide ( TRAP ) -induced phenotypes of platelet aggregation and P16109 expression . We investigated whether the P25116 intervening sequence-14 A > T dimorphism influences platelet procoagulant activity . We also determined whether the Q9H244 antagonist clopidogrel could offset any observed functional polymorphism of the P25116 receptor by inhibiting Q9H244 -mediated amplification of TRAP-induced responses . We studied 54 patients listed for elective percutaneous coronary intervention assessing TRAP-induced platelet aggregation and markers of procoagulant activity . Platelet responses were measured at baseline , 4 h post clopidogrel 300 mg , and 10 and 28 days following clopidogrel 75 mg daily . Each patient was genotyped for the P25116 intervening sequence-14 A/T dimorphism . Increased platelet aggregation and procoagulant responses were observed with P25116 A allele homozygotes . DB00758 significantly inhibited these platelet responses regardless of P25116 genotype , but did not offset the hyper-reactivity associated with the A/A homozygotes . We conclude that a common sequence variation within the P25116 gene influences TRAP-induced platelet procoagulant activity as well as aggregation . Higher platelet reactivity associated with P25116 IVSn-14 A allele homozygotes persists despite clopidogrel therapy . These individuals may be at higher risk of thromboembolic events and may require additional anti-platelet medication . P01375 -alpha blocks apoptosis in melanoma cells when P15056 signaling is inhibited . The protein kinase P15056 , a component of the DB01367 /RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) kinase ( MEK ) / P29323 signaling pathway , regulates cell fate in response to extracellular signals . Activating mutations in P15056 occur in approximately 70 % of human melanomas . The active proteins stimulate constitutive pathway signaling , proliferation , and survival . Thus , inhibition of P15056 signaling in melanoma cells causes cell cycle arrest and induces cell death through apoptosis , validating P15056 as an important therapeutic target . Here , we show that the apoptosis induced by inhibition of P15056 signaling in melanoma cells can be prevented if the cells are treated with tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha . This allows the cells to recover from the inhibition of P15056 signaling and reenter the cell cycle . This effect occurs due to a specific P01375 and P15056 interaction because P01375 does not prevent cell death in the presence of cisplatin , nitrogen mustard or thapsigargin . Furthermore , the cytokines P48023 , P50591 , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , and P05231 do not prevent cell death when P15056 signaling is inhibited . The survival mechanism requires nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) transcription factor activity , which is strongly induced by P01375 in these cells . These findings suggest that drugs that target the P15056 /MEK pathway could be combined with agents that target P01375 and/or NF-kappaB signaling to provide exciting new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of melanoma . Flow cytometric analysis of mammalian glial cultures treated with methotrexate . DB00563 ( MTX ) is an antineoplastic drug that acts by competitive inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . MTX treatment of cultured cell lines leads to the emergence of resistant cell populations . Studies using stepwise selection procedures have demonstrated that MTX resistance conferred by overproduction of P00374 can be caused by P00374 gene amplification . We examined the effect of MTX on cells whose origin more closely approximates the in vivo condition by developing a culture system using dissociated brain tissue from 17-19 day old mouse embryos . At the first passage , cultures were divided into control and MTX groups . Cells were treated with the same or successively higher concentrations of MTX at each passage over a 3-4 month period . The first passage eliminated neurons and left a glial culture comprised of approximately 90 % astrocytes . We used the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter in conjunction with fluorescent dyes to measure P00374 content , DNA content , size , and viability of glial cells following MTX treatment . MTX-treated cells divided but grew more slowly and were larger than untreated cells . Stepwise selection in 30/60/90 nM or 60/120 nM MTX resulted in significant two- to threefold increases in fluorescence , and hence P00374 levels . Slot hybridizations assays demonstrated a threefold increase in P00374 gene copy number in the DNA from the 30/60/90 cultures . Thus , our findings were consistent with the results obtained from somatic cell lines , and lend support to the hypothesis that gene amplification may be a common mechanism for the acquisition of resistance in many types of cells . They also indicate that glial cells may be a specific target for cytotoxic effects of MTX on the central nervous system . A guide to picking the most selective kinase inhibitor tool compounds for pharmacological validation of drug targets . To establish the druggability of a target , genetic validation needs to be supplemented with pharmacological validation . Pharmacological studies , especially in the kinase field , are hampered by the fact that many reference inhibitors are not fully selective for one target . Fortunately , the initial trickle of selective inhibitors released in the public domain has steadily swelled into a stream . However , rationally picking the most selective tool compound out of the increasing amounts of available inhibitors has become progressively difficult due to the lack of accurate quantitative descriptors of drug selectivity . A recently published approach , termed ' selectivity entropy ' , is an improved way of expressing selectivity as a single-value parameter and enables rank ordering of inhibitors . We provide a guide to select the best tool compounds for pharmacological validation experiments of candidate drug targets using selectivity entropy . In addition , we recommend which inhibitors to use for studying the biology of the 20 most investigated kinases that are clinically relevant : Abl ( P00519 ) , P31749 , Q9UM73 , Aurora A/B , CDKs , MET , P07333 ( P07333 ) , P00533 , P36888 , P04626 ( P04626 ) , O14920 ( O14920 ) , O60674 /3 , P45983 /2/3 ( P45983 /9/10 ) , Q02750 /2 , P53350 , PI3Ks , p38α ( Q16539 ) , P15056 , P12931 and P35968 ( P35968 ) . A novel function for platelet-derived growth factor D : induction of osteoclastic differentiation for intraosseous tumor growth . Although increasing evidence suggests a critical role for platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor β ( β- P09619 ) signaling in prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression , the precise roles of β- P09619 and PDGF isoform-specific cell signaling have not been delineated . Recently , we identified the Q9GZP0 isoform as a ligand for β- P09619 in PCa and showed that Q9GZP0 is activated by serine protease-mediated proteolytic removal of the CUB domain in a two-step process , yielding first a hemidimer ( HD ) and then a growth factor domain dimer . Herein , we demonstrate that the expression of Q9GZP0 in human PCa LNCaP cells leads to enhanced bone tumor growth and bone responses in immunodeficient mice . Histopathological analyses of bone tumors generated by Q9GZP0 -expressing LNCaP cells ( LNCaP- Q9GZP0 ) revealed osteolytic and osteoblastic responses similar to those observed in human PCa bone metastases . Importantly , we discovered a novel function of Q9GZP0 in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation , independent of the O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 signaling axis . Although both PDGF-B and -D were able to activate β- P09619 , only Q9GZP0 was able to induce osteoclastic differentiation in vitro , and upregulate the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 , a master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis . Taken together , these results reveal a new function of Q9GZP0 as a regulator of osteoclastic differentiation , an activity critical for the establishment of skeletal metastatic deposit in PCa patients . Transduction of P28906 + cells with lentiviral vectors enables the production of large quantities of transgene-expressing immature and mature dendritic cells . BACKGROUND : Genetically engineered dendritic cells ( DC ) presenting specific antigens to T cells may be of great interest for immunotherapy . For this reason , the production of transgene-expressing DC derived from P28906 + cells transduced either shortly after ex vivo purification or during their differentiation into DC were evaluated . METHODS : P28906 + cells were transduced with lentivectors encoding for GFP before or after 21 days of culture with P36888 -ligand , thrombopoietin and stem cell factor and induction into DC with GM- P04141 + P05112 ( G4 ) or G4+ P01375 ( GT4 ) . GFP and DC-specific marker expression was assessed by flow cytometry , and allostimulatory capacity was evaluated on GFP+ and GFP- sorted cells . RESULTS : Immature ( G4-induced ) DC obtained from amplified P28906 + cells were transducible by lentiviral vectors while mature ( GT4-induced ) DC were rather refractory . Moreover , since differentiated DC did not proliferate , large quantities of vectors were required to generate transgene-expressing cells with this protocol . In contrast , greater numbers of both immature and mature GFP- expressing DC were obtained with P28906 + cells exposed to lentivector shortly after purification . By the time of DC induction , GFP+ cells had increased by approximately 170-fold . After DC induction with G4 , 32 % of CD1a+ , HLA-DR+ , or P25942 + cells expressed GFP . CD1a+ P12830 + GFP+ Langerhans-like DC were also obtained . Incubation with P01375 induced mature Q01151 +GFP+ DC that displayed a higher allostimulatory capacity than cells induced with G4 alone . CONCLUSION : The transduction of a small number of P28906 + cells with minimal doses of lentivector may allow for the production of a large number of DC expressing selected antigens useful for immunotherapy . Discovery of potent , orally active compounds of tyrosine kinase and serine/threonine-protein kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor activity in preclinical assays . Traditional medicines have become the most productive source of leads for drugs development , particularly as anti-cancer agents . Various screening approaches are being applied . DB00398 , a multikinase inhibitor , is used to treat primary kidney cancer ( advanced renal cell carcinoma ) and advanced primary liver cancer . A small library of compounds analogous to sorafenib were designed and screened for the treatment of liver cancer . Multiple members of the family in an assay panel of tyrosine kinase family and serine/threonine-protein kinase family , including VEGFR , Abl , Aurora A , p 38 , Lck , Src , P09619 , Flt3 , c-RAF , c- P10721 , MEK(MAPKK) were selected to test these compounds . Analysis of the selectivity patterns for these compounds shows specificity for many kinase families . IC₅₀ were measured for the selected compounds . Multiple compounds have very similar kinase inhibition profiles of VEGFR , Flt3 , FGFR to that of sorafenib . The IC₅₀ of c-RAF of BB1 is lower than sorafenib . The IC₅₀ of c-RAF of BB3-12 is higher than that of sorafenib . For Flt3 , IC₅₀ of BB1-4 is less than sorafenib . The IC₅₀ value of P35968 of BB1-10 is less than sorafenib. especially against c-RAF , P09619 , c- P10721 , P35968 compared to sorafenib . These compounds are potent Raf1 and Flt4 kinase inhibitors . Revealing multi-binding sites for taspine to P35968 by cell membrane chromatography zonal elution . A new high-expression vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( P35968 ) cell membrane chromatography ( CMC ) method was developed to investigate the affinity of ligands for P35968 . An HEK293 P35968 /CMC system was applied to specifically recognize ligands acting on P35968 . DB00398 was used as a mobile phase additive to evaluate the effect of the marker 's concentration on the retention of sorafenib and taspine , respectively . The relationship among the retention , the types of binding sites and the affinity of taspine binding to P35968 has also been concerned . The retention behavior indicated that sorafenib had two major binding regions on P35968 , and that taspine might act as a multi-target P35968 inhibitor with similar biological activity to sorafenib . The equilibrium dissociation constants ( K(D) ) obtained from the model are ( 5.25 ± 0.31 ) × 10⁻⁷ and ( 9.88 ± 0.54 ) × 10⁻⁵ mol L⁻¹ for sorafenib at the high- and low-affinity sites , respectively , and the corresponding values for taspine are ( 3.88 ± 0.31 ) × 10⁻⁶ and ( 7.04 ± 0.49 ) ×10⁻⁵ mol L⁻¹ . The two types of binding sites contributed about a 1:2 ratio on the retention of taspine . Connexin 43 and P29323 regulate tension-induced signal transduction in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts . Periodontal ligament ( PDL ) fibroblasts play an important role in preserving periodontal homeostasis and transmitting mechanical signals to alveolar bone . Connexin 43 ( P17302 ) , a gap junction protein , is essential for bone homeostasis and regulates bone remodeling . However , the function of P17302 in human PDL fibroblast-regulated bone remodeling has not yet been elucidated . In this study , human PDL fibroblasts were exposed to cyclic mechanical tension with a maximum 5 % elongation for different durations . We then examined the expression of signaling molecules related to osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis at both the mRNA and protein levels as well as the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) in human PDL fibroblasts after loading . We found that mechanical tension increased P17302 , which further upregulated osteogenic ( e.g. , Q13950 , Osterix , and O00300 ) and down-regulated osteoclastogenic ( e.g. , O14788 ) signaling molecules . Suppressing P17302 gene ( Gja1 ) by siRNA inhibited the increase in osteogenesis-related molecules but enhanced O14788 expression . Similar to P17302 , activated P27361 /2 was also enhanced by mechanical tension and suppressed by P17302 siRNA . Inhibition of P27361 /2 signaling using PD98059 reduced the tension-regulated increase in osteogenesis-related molecules but enhanced that of osteoclastogenesis-related ones . These findings suggest that cyclic tension may involve into the osteogenic or osteoclastogenetic differentiation potential of human PDL fibroblasts via the P17302 - P27361 /2 signaling pathway . Clot penetration and retention by plasminogen activators promote fibrinolysis . P00750 ( tPA ) remains the sole thrombolytic approved by the FDA for the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE). tPA has not been replaced by third generation plasminogen activators , e.g. DB00015 ( Ret ) and DB00031 ( TNK ) that circulate with longer life-spans and in theory should have more extended potency in vivo . One reason for this paradox is the inability to assign units of activity to plasminogen activators based on specific biologically relevant standards , which impairs objective comparison . Here , we compare clot permeation , retention and fibrinolytic activities of tPA , TNK and Ret in vitro and clot composition over time with outcome in a mouse model of disseminated pulmonary microembolism ( ME ) . When clots were incubated in the continuous presence of drug , tPA , TNK and Ret lysed fibrin clots identically in the absence of PA inhibitor-1 ( e.g. P05121 ) . Ret , which has lower fibrin affinity and greater susceptibility to inhibition by P05121 than tPA , was less effective in lysing plasma clots , while TNK was less effective when the fibrin content of the clots was enhanced . However , when clots were afforded only brief exposure to drug , as occurs in vivo , Ret showed more extensive clot permeation , greater retention and lysis than tPA or TNK . These results were reproduced in vivo in a mouse model of ME . These studies indicate the need for more relevant tests of plasminogen activator activity in vitro and in vivo and they show that clot permeation and retention are important potential predictors of clinical utility .
Inhibition of Q16552 as a pharmacological approach for Q9UKU7 . Several experimental approaches have been utilized , in order to critically examine the roles of Q16552 family members in intestinal inflammation . These approaches have included : ( 1 ) the use of Q16552 and Q96PD4 -deficient mice , ( 2 ) specific antibodies directed against Q16552 , ( 3 ) an Q16552 vaccine , ( 4 ) methods to block the Q16552 receptor and ( 5 ) small-molecule inhibitors of Q16552 . Previous studies found somewhat conflicting results in preclinical models of Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( Q9UKU7 ) , using specific strains of Q16552 -deficient mice . This paper will review the preclinical results using various pharmacological approaches [ specific Q16552 antibodies , an Q16552 receptor fusion protein , IL-12/IL-23 p40 subunit and Q16552 vaccine approaches , as well as a small molecule inhibitor ( Vidofludimus ) ] to inhibit Q16552 in animal models of Q9UKU7 . Recent clinical results in patients with Q9UKU7 will also be discussed for DB09029 ( an Q16552 antibody ) , Brodalumab ( an Q16552 receptor antibody ) and two small-molecule drugs ( Vidofludimus and DB08895 ) , which inhibit Q16552 as part of their overall pharmacological profiles . This review paper will also discuss some pharmacological lessons learned from the preclinical and clinical studies with anti- Q16552 drugs , as related to drug pharmacodynamics , Q16552 receptor subtypes and other pertinent factors . Finally , future pharmacological approaches of interest will be discussed , such as : ( 1 ) Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t ( Rorγt ) antagonists , ( 2 ) P10276 ( RARα ) antagonists , ( 3 ) Pim-1 kinase inhibitors and ( 4 ) Dual small-molecule inhibitors of NF-κB and P40763 , like synthetic triterpenoids . Comparison of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone with clozapine and olanzapine : inhibition of dorsal raphe cell firing and the role of P08908 receptor activation . Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent which binds with high affinity to P08908 receptors ( Ki = 3.4 nM ) , in addition to P28221 , 5-HT2 , and D2 sites . While it is an antagonist at these latter receptors , ziprasidone behaves as a P08908 agonist in vitro in adenylate cyclase measurements . The goal of the present study was to examine the P08908 properties of ziprasidone in vivo using as a marker of central P08908 activity the inhibition of firing of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus . In anesthetized rats , ziprasidone dose-dependently slowed raphe unit activity ( ED50 = 300 micrograms/kg i.v. ) as did the atypical antipsychotics clozapine ( ED50 = 250 micrograms/kg i.v. ) and olanzapine ( ED50 = 1000 micrograms/kg i.v. ) . Pretreatment with the P08908 antagonist WAY-100,635 ( 10 micrograms/kg i.v. ) prevented the ziprasidone-induced inhibition ; the same dose of WAY-100,635 had little effect on the inhibition produced by clozapine and olanzapine . Because all three agents also bind to alpha 1 receptors , antagonists of which inhibit serotonin neuronal firing , this aspect of their pharmacology was assessed with desipramine ( DB01151 ) , a NE re-uptake blocker previously shown to reverse the effects of alpha 1 antagonists on raphe unit activity . DB01151 ( 5 mg/kg i.v. ) failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of ziprasidone but produced nearly complete reversal of that of clozapine and olanzapine . These profiles suggest a mechanism of action for each agent , P08908 agonism for ziprasidone and alpha 1 antagonism for clozapine and olanzapine . The P08908 agonist activity reported here clearly distinguishes ziprasidone from currently available antipsychotic agents and suggests that this property may play a significant role in its pharmacologic actions . P35367 antagonist cetirizine impairs working memory processing speed , but not episodic memory . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : The histaminergic neurotransmitter system is currently under investigation as a target for drug treatment of cognitive deficits in clinical disorders . The therapeutic potential of new drugs may initially be screened using a model of histaminergic dysfunction , for example , as associated with the use of centrally active antihistamines . Of the selective second generation antihistamines , cetirizine has been found to have central nervous system effects . The aim of the present study was to determine whether cetirizine can be used as a tool to model cognitive deficits associated with histaminergic hypofunction . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : The study was conducted according to a three-way , double-blind , cross-over design . Treatments were single oral doses of cetirizine 10 and 20 mg and placebo . Effects on cognition were assessed using tests of word learning , memory scanning , vigilance , divided attention , tracking and visual information processing speed . KEY RESULTS : DB00341 10 mg impaired tracking performance and both doses impaired memory scanning speed . None of the other measures indicated impaired performance . CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS : DB00341 affects information processing speed , but these effects were not sufficient to serve as a model for cognitive deficits in clinical disorders . 8-OH-DPAT ( P08908 agonist ) Attenuates 6-Hydroxy- dopamine-induced catalepsy and Modulates Inflammatory Cytokines in Rats . OBJECTIVE(S) : Neuroinflammation in Parkinson disease ( PD ) is associated with glial cells activation and production of different inflammatory cytokines . In this study , we investigated the effect of chronic administration of 8-OH-DPAT on 6-OHDA-induced catalepsy and levels of inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Catalepsy was induced by unilateral infusion of 6-OHDA ( 8 μg/2 μl/rat ) into the central region of the sabstantia nigra pars compacta ( SNc ) being assessed by the bar-test , 5 , 60 , 120 and 180 min after intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration of 8-OH-DPAT ( P08908 receptor agonist ; 0.25 , 0.5 and 1mg/kg , IP for 10 days ) . P04141 samples were collected on the tenth day of 8-OH-DPAT administration and analyzed by ELISA method to measure levels of P01375 -α , IL-1β and P05231 . RESULTS : Chronic injection of 8-OH-DPAT decreased catalepsy in a dose dependent manner when compared with the control group . The most anti-cataleptic effect was observed at the dose of 1 mg/kg of 8-OH-DPAT . Levels of P01375 -α in P04141 increased three weeks after 6-OHDA injection while there was a significant decrease in P01375 -α level of parkinsonian animals treated with 8-OH-DPAT ( 1 mg/kg , IP for 10 days ) . IL-1β and P05231 decreased and increased in parkinsonian rats and in 8-OH-DPAT-treated parkinsonian rats , respectively . CONCLUSION : Our study indicated that chronic administration of 8-OH-DPAT improves catalepsy in 6-OHDA-induced animal model of PD and restores central concentration of inflammatory cytokines to the basal levels . P08908 receptor agonists can be suggested as potential adjuvant therapy in PD by modulation of cerebral inflammatory cytokines . Thrombin and activated protein C inhibit the expression of secretory group IIA phospholipase A(2) in the P01375 -activated endothelial cells by Q9UNN8 and P25116 dependent mechanisms . INTRODUCTION : Thrombin and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha up-regulate the expression of proinflammatory molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . However , activated protein C ( P25054 ) down-regulates the expression of the same molecules . The expression level of secretory group IIA phospholipase A(2) ( sPLA(2)-IIA ) is known to be elevated in inflammatory disorders including in sepsis . Here , we investigated the effects of P25054 and thrombin on the expression of sPLA(2)-IIA and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) in HUVECs . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The expression level of sPLA(2)-IIA was quantitatively measured by an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay following stimulation of HUVECs with either thrombin or P01375 in the absence and presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 -kinase ) inhibitor LY294002 and the cholesterol-depleting drug methyl-beta-cyclodextrin ( MbetaCD ) . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS : Thrombin had no effect on the expression of sPLA(2)-IIA in HUVECs , however , P01375 potently induced its expression . The prior treatment of cells with P25054 inhibited expression of sPLA(2)-IIA through the Q9UNN8 -dependent cleavage of P25116 . Further studies revealed that if HUVECs were pretreated with the zymogen protein C to occupy Q9UNN8 , thrombin also inhibited the P01375 -mediated expression of sPLA(2)-IIA through the cleavage of P25116 . The Q9UNN8 -dependent cleavage of P25116 by both P25054 and thrombin increased the phosphorylation of P29323 1/2 . Pretreatment of cells with either LY294002 or MbetaCD abolished the inhibitory activity of both P25054 and thrombin against sPLA(2)-IIA expression , suggesting that the protein C occupancy of Q9UNN8 confers a P19957 -kinase dependent protective activity for thrombin such that its cleavage of the lipid-raft localized P25116 inhibits the P01375 -mediated expression of sPLA(2)-IIA in HUVECs . Beyond statins : new lipid lowering strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk . Statins are the first-line therapy in LDL- DB04540 ( LDL-C ) reduction and its clinical use has contributed to significant prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease . Yet , a significant proportion of patients remain at high risk . Recently , a number of new therapies have been developed to further lower LDL-C . These agents may provide clinical benefit on top of statin therapy in patients with high residual risk , severe hypercholesterolemia or as an alternative for patients who are intolerant to statins . We review four novel approaches based on the inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) , apolipoprotein-B100 ( apoB ) , Cholesteryl ester transport protein ( P11597 ) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) . ApoB and P55157 inhibitors ( DB05528 and DB08827 ) are indicated only for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients . The results of ongoing trials with P11597 and Q8NBP7 inhibitors may warrant a wider employment in different categories of patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease . Genetic markers in the EET metabolic pathway are associated with outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Preclinical studies show that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids ( EETs ) regulate cerebrovascular tone and protect against cerebral ischemia . We investigated the relationship between polymorphic genes involved in EET biosynthesis/metabolism , cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) eicosanoid levels , and outcomes in 363 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( DHET ) cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) levels , as well as acute outcomes defined by delayed cerebral ischemia ( P42126 ) or clinical neurologic deterioration ( CND ) , were assessed over 14 days . Long-term outcomes were defined by Modified Rankin Scale ( P59665 ) at 3 and 12 months . P10632 *4 allele carriers had 44 % and 36 % lower mean EET and DHET P04141 levels ( P=0.003 and P=0.007 ) and were 2.2- and 2.5-fold more likely to develop P42126 and CND ( P=0.039 and P=0.041 ) , respectively . P34913 55Arg , P51589 *7 , P10632 *1B , and P10632 g.36785A allele carriers had lower EET and DHET P04141 levels . P10632 g.25369T and P10632 g.36755A allele carriers had higher EET levels . Patients with P10632 *2C and P34913 404del variants had worse long-term outcomes while those with P34913 287Gln , P51589 *7 , and P11712 g.816G variants had favorable outcomes . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid levels were associated with Fisher grade and unfavorable 3-month outcomes . Dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were not associated with outcomes . No associations passed Bonferroni multiple testing correction . These are the first clinical data demonstrating the association between the EET biosynthesis/metabolic pathway and the pathophysiology of aSAH . Altered gene expression by low-dose arsenic exposure in humans and cultured cardiomyocytes : assessment by real-time PCR arrays . Chronic arsenic exposure results in higher risk of skin , lung , and bladder cancer , as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes . The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects on expression of selected genes in the blood lymphocytes from 159 people exposed chronically to arsenic in their drinking water using a novel RT-PCR TaqMan low-density array ( TLDA ) . We found that expression of tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) , which activates both inflammation and NF-κB-dependent survival pathways , was strongly associated with water and urinary arsenic levels . Expression of P22460 , which encodes a potassium ion channel protein , was positively associated with water and toe nail arsenic levels . Expression of 2 and 11 genes were positively associated with nail and urinary arsenic , respectively . Because arsenic exposure has been reported to be associated with long QT intervals and vascular disease in humans , we also used this TLDA for analysis of gene expression in human cardiomyocytes exposed to arsenic in vitro . Expression of the ion-channel genes CACNA1 , Q12809 , P51787 and P15382 were down-regulated by 1-μM arsenic . Alteration of some common pathways , including those involved in oxidative stress , inflammatory signaling , and ion-channel function , may underlay the seemingly disparate array of arsenic-associated diseases , such as cancer , cardiovascular disease , and diabetes . Signaling by proinflammatory cytokines : oligomerization of TRAF2 and Q9Y4K3 is sufficient for JNK and IKK activation and target gene induction via an amino-terminal effector domain . Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) stimulate transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB through activation of the Q96HU1 kinases JNK and p38 and the O15111 ( IKK ) , respectively . The P01375 and IL-1 signals are transduced through TRAF2 and Q9Y4K3 , respectively . Overexpressed TRAF2 or Q9Y4K3 activate JNK , p38 , or IKK in the absence of extracellular stimulation . By replacing the carboxy-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF2 and Q9Y4K3 with repeats of the immunophilin P62942 , we demonstrate that their effector domains are composed of their amino-terminal Zn and RING fingers . Oligomerization of the TRAF2 effector domain results in specific binding to Q13233 , a protein kinase capable of JNK , p38 , and IKK activation , and induction of P01375 and IL-1 responsive genes . P01375 also enhances the binding of native TRAF2 to Q13233 and stimulates the kinase activity of the latter . Thus , P01375 and IL-1 signaling is based on oligomerization of TRAF2 and Q9Y4K3 leading to activation of effector kinases . The relationship of P04141 and plasma cytokine levels to cerebral white matter injury in the premature newborn . Ischemia and systemic infection are implicated in the etiology of periventricular white matter injury , a major cause of adverse motor and cognitive outcome in preterm infants . Cytokines are signaling proteins that can be produced as part of the inflammatory response to both ischemia and infection . The aim of this study was to relate cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) concentrations of P05231 , P10145 , P22301 , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) , and interferon gamma ( P01579 ) to magnetic resonance-defined white matter injury in preterm infants . Relationships between P04141 and plasma cytokine concentrations were also examined . Preterm infants ( < or=32 wk ) and more mature infants from The Royal Women 's Hospital , Melbourne , Australia , and Christchurch Women 's Hospital , Christchurch , New Zealand , were eligible for study if they required a clinically indicated lumbar puncture . Plasma samples were obtained in a subgroup of Christchurch infants . Preterm infants underwent advanced quantitative volumetric magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5-Tesla scanner at term equivalent . One hundred forty-six infants were enrolled and 190 P04141 and 42 plasma samples obtained . There was no significant correlation between paired P04141 and plasma concentrations for any cytokine . In comparing plasma and P04141 concentrations , levels of P10145 were significantly higher in P04141 than plasma . Preterm infants with Q9BWK5 -defined cerebral white matter injury had higher levels of P05231 , P22301 , and P01375 in the P04141 than infants without such injury . Plasma cytokine concentrations may not reflect P04141 cytokine levels or inflammatory events within the brain . Elevated P04141 levels of cytokines in infants with white matter injury suggest an altered inflammatory balance . Not all monoclonals are created equal - lessons from failed drug trials in Crohn 's disease . The recent success of the anti-integrin antibody DB09033 can barely conceal the fact that the biologics armamentarium in Crohn 's disease has barely evolved beyond P01375 blockers so far . This contrasts with other immune-related diseases considered mechanistically and genetically closely related , such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis , where approved biologics target a variety of independent biological mechanisms . Several pharmacological assets that entered clinical development have proven ineffective , or less effective than originally anticipated . While blockade of Q16552 and its receptor via DB09029 and Brodalumab , respectively , worsened Crohn 's disease , the beneficial effect of IL-12/23 p40 blockade via Ustekinumab appeared confined to a subpopulation of Crohn 's disease patients who have previously failed on P01375 blockers . Clinical development of the IFNγ blocker DB05111 was stopped despite demonstrating some clinical benefit , while the T cell co-stimulation blocker DB01281 did not exhibit any hint towards efficacy in Crohn 's disease . Here I review results from these individual development programmes , and also reflect on the lack of efficacy of the P01375 blocker DB00005 . I will discuss aspects of individual trials that might have confounded their interpretation and highlight the evolution in primary and secondary endpoints that have contributed to increasing robustness of results obtained in recent years . Finally , I suggest that mechanistic studies in murine genetic models combined with exploratory immunological studies incorporated in early drug development may represent the key for identifying the next generation of successful pharmacological targets in Crohn 's disease . Neonatal ghrelin programs development of hypothalamic feeding circuits . A complex neural network regulates body weight and energy balance , and dysfunction in the communication between the gut and this neural network is associated with metabolic diseases , such as obesity . The stomach-derived hormone ghrelin stimulates appetite through interactions with neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus ( Q5SW96 ) . Here , we evaluated the physiological and neurobiological contribution of ghrelin during development by specifically blocking ghrelin action during early postnatal development in mice . Ghrelin blockade in neonatal mice resulted in enhanced Q5SW96 neural projections and long-term metabolic effects , including increased body weight , visceral fat , and blood glucose levels and decreased leptin sensitivity . In addition , chronic administration of ghrelin during postnatal life impaired the normal development of Q5SW96 projections and caused metabolic dysfunction . Consistent with these observations , direct exposure of postnatal Q5SW96 neuronal explants to ghrelin blunted axonal growth and blocked the neurotrophic effect of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin . Moreover , chronic ghrelin exposure in neonatal mice also attenuated leptin-induced P40763 signaling in Q5SW96 neurons . Collectively , these data reveal that ghrelin plays an inhibitory role in the development of hypothalamic neural circuits and suggest that proper expression of ghrelin during neonatal life is pivotal for lifelong metabolic regulation . Niacin reduces plasma P11597 levels by diminishing liver macrophage content in P11597 transgenic mice . The anti-dyslipidemic drug niacin has recently been shown to reduce the hepatic expression and plasma levels of P11597 . Since liver macrophages contribute to hepatic P11597 expression , we investigated the role of macrophages in the P11597 -lowering effect of niacin in mice . In vitro studies showed that niacin does not directly attenuate P11597 expression in macrophages . Treatment of normolipidemic human P11597 transgenic mice , fed a Western-type diet with niacin for 4 weeks , significantly reduced the hepatic cholesterol concentration ( -20 % ) , hepatic P11597 gene expression ( -20 % ) , and plasma P11597 mass ( -30 % ) . Concomitantly , niacin decreased the hepatic expression of P34810 ( -44 % ) and P45844 ( -32 % ) , both of which are specific markers for the hepatic macrophage content . The decrease in hepatic P11597 expression was significantly correlated with the reduction of hepatic macrophage markers . Furthermore , niacin attenuated atherogenic diet-induced inflammation in liver , as evident from decreased expression of P01375 ( -43 % ) . Niacin similarly decreased the macrophage markers and absolute macrophage content in hyperlipidemic P02649 *3-Leiden. P11597 transgenic mice on a Western-type diet . In conclusion , niacin decreases hepatic P11597 expression and plasma P11597 mass by attenuating liver inflammation and macrophage content in response to its primary lipid-lowering effect , rather than by attenuating the macrophage P11597 expression level . Microsomal transfer protein ( P55157 ) inhibition-a novel approach to the treatment of homozygous hypercholesterolemia . Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) represents the most severe lipoprotein disorder , generally attributable to mutation(s) of the low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDL-R ) , i.e. autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia type 1 ( P07327 ) . Much lower percentages are due to alterations of apolipoprotein B ( P00325 ) , or gain-of-function mutations of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) ( P00326 ) . In certain geographical areas a significant number of patients may be affected by an autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia ( Q5SW96 ) . Mutations may be also combined ( two mutations of the same gene , compound heterozygosity ) , or two in different genes ( double heterozygosity ) . Among the most innovative therapeutic approaches made available recently , inhibitors of the microsomal transfer protein ( P55157 ) system have shown a high clinical potential . P55157 plays a critical role in the assembly/secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins ( VLDL ) , and its absence leads to apo B deficiency . P55157 antagonists dramatically lower LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) in animals , although a reported increase of liver fat delayed their clinical development . DB08827 , the best-studied P55157 inhibitor , reduces LDL-C by 50 % or more in HoFH patients , with modest , reversible , liver steatosis . Recent US approval has confirmed an acceptable tolerability , provided patients adhere to a strictly low-fat regimen . There are no clinical data on atherosclerosis reduction/regression , but animal models provide encouraging results . c-Fes tyrosine kinase binds to and activates P40763 after granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulation . Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) induces proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells and also activates neutrophils . In order to investigate the pleiotropic effects of GM- P04141 stimulation , we examined the signaling pathways of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) in GM- P04141 -dependent proliferation of leukemia cells . Using TF-1 , a GM- P04141 -dependent human erythroleukemia cell line , we found that GM- P04141 enhanced DNA-binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of P40763 . GM- P04141 receptor ( GM-CSFR ) and c-Fes tyrosine kinase were also activated upon GM- P04141 stimulation . Furthermore , c-Fes formed a complex with P40763 . Experiments using a c-Fes mutant that lacked tyrosine kinase activity revealed that the activation of P40763 is kinase-dependent , but that the c-Fes- P40763 interaction is not affected by c-Fes tyrosine kinase activity . The results suggest that P40763 is activated by c-Fes tyrosine kinase through direct interaction during hematopoietic cell proliferation induced by GM- P04141 . Inhibition of histamine H1 receptor activity modulates proinflammatory cytokine production of dendritic cells through c-Rel activity . BACKGROUND : DB11320 exerts diverse effects on immune regulation through four types of histamine receptors ( HRs ) . Among them , type 1 receptor ( P35367 ) plays an important role in allergic inflammation . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) , which express at least three types of HRs , are professional antigen-presenting cells controlling the development of allergic inflammation . However , the molecular mechanisms involved in P35367 -mediated NF-ĸB signaling of DCs remain poorly defined . METHODS : Bone-marrow ( BM ) -derived DCs ( BM-DCs ) were treated with P35367 inverse agonists to interrupt basal P35367 -mediated signaling . The crosstalk of P35367 -mediated signaling and the NF-ĸB pathway was examined by NF-ĸB cellular activity using a luciferase reporter assay , NF-ĸB subunit analysis using Western blotting and P01375 -α promoter activity using chromatin immunoprecipitation . RESULTS : Blockage of P35367 signaling by inverse agonists significantly inhibited P01375 -α and P05231 production of BM-DCs . P35367 -specific agonists were able to enhance P01375 -α production , but this overexpression was significantly inhibited by NF-ĸB inhibitor . The P35367 inverse agonist ketotifen also suppressed cellular NF-ĸB activity , suggesting crosstalk between P35367 and NF-ĸB signaling in DCs . After comprehensive analysis of NF-ĸB subunits , c-Rel protein expression was significantly down-regulated in ketotifen-treated BM-DCs , which led to inhibition of the promoter activity of P01375 -α . Finally , adoptive transfer of the ketotifen-treated BM-DCs did not induce significant allergic airway inflammation compared to that of control cells in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that c-Rel controls P35367 -mediated proinflammatory cytokine production in DCs . This study provides a potential mechanism of P35367 -mediated signaling and NF-ĸB pathway crosstalk in allergic inflammation . Forced retinoic acid receptor alpha homodimers prime mice for APL-like leukemia . P10276 becomes an acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) oncogene by fusion with any of five translocation partners . Unlike RARalpha , the fusion proteins homodimerize , which may be central to oncogenic activation . This model was tested by replacing P29590 with dimerization domains from p50NFkappaB ( p50-RARalpha ) or the rapamycin-sensitive dimerizing peptide of P62942 ( P13726 -RARalpha ) . The X-RARalpha fusions recapitulated in vitro activities of P29590 -RARalpha . For P13726 -RARalpha , these properties were rapamycin sensitive . Although in vivo the artificial fusions alone are poor initiators of leukemia , p50-RARalpha readily cooperates with an activated mutant P32927 to induce APL-like disease . These results demonstrate that the dimerization interface of RARalpha fusion partners is a critical element in APL pathogenesis while pointing to other features of P29590 for enhancing penetrance and progression . The low-potency , voltage-dependent Q12809 blocker propafenone -- molecular determinants and drug trapping . The molecular determinants of high-affinity human ether-a-go-go-related gene ( Q12809 ) potassium channel blockade by methanesulfonanilides include two aromatic residues ( Phe656 and Tyr652 ) on the inner helices ( S6 ) and residues on the pore helices that face into the inner cavity , but determinants for lower-affinity Q12809 blockers may be different . In this study , alanine-substituted Q12809 channel mutants of inner cavity residues were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and were used to characterize the Q12809 channel binding site of the antiarrhythmic propafenone . DB01182 's blockade of Q12809 was strongly dependent on residue Phe656 but was insensitive or weakly sensitive to mutation of Tyr652 , Thr623 , Ser624 , Val625 , Gly648 , or Val659 and did not require functional inactivation . Homology models of Q12809 based on KcsA and MthK crystal structures , representing the closed and open forms of the channel , respectively , suggest propafenone is trapped in the inner cavity and is unable to interact exclusively with Phe656 in the closed state ( whereas exclusive interactions between propafenone and Phe656 are found in the open-channel model ) . These findings are supported by very slow recovery of wild-type Q12809 channels from block at -120 mV , but extremely rapid recovery of D540K channels that reopen at this potential . The experiments and modeling suggest that the open-state propafenone binding-site may be formed by the Phe656 residues alone . The binding site for propafenone ( which may involve pi-stacking interactions with two or more Phe656 side-chains ) is either perturbed or becomes less accessible because of closed-channel gating . This provides further evidence for the existence of gating-induced changes in the spatial location of Phe656 side chains . Generation of Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes resistant to the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus ( FK506 ) . Adoptive transfer of autologous Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( EBV-CTLs ) to solid organ transplant ( SOT ) recipients has been shown safe and effective for the treatment of EBV-associated posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLDs ) . SOT recipients , however , require the continuous administration of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent graft rejection , and these agents may significantly limit the long-term persistence of transferred EBV-CTLs , precluding their use as prophylaxis . DB00864 ( FK506 ) is one of the most widely used immunosuppressive agents in SOT recipients , and its immunosuppressive effects are largely dependent on its interaction with the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein ( P62942 ) . We have knocked down the expression of P62942 in EBV-CTLs using a specific small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) stably expressed from a retroviral vector and found that P62942 -silenced EBV-CTLs are FK506 resistant . These cells continue to expand in the presence of the drug without measurable impairment of their antigen specificity or cytotoxic activity . We confirmed their FK506 resistance and anti-PTLD activity in vivo using a xenogenic mouse model , suggesting that the proposed strategy may be of value to enhance EBV-specific immune surveillance in patients at high risk of PTLD after transplantation . Serotonin receptor activation leads to neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival . Serotonin 5-HT1 receptors are implicated in anxiety and depression . These receptors belong to the family A of G-protein-coupled receptors and couple to inhibitory G-proteins . Recent studies show that chronic activation of P08908 receptors leads to proliferation of hippocampal neurons suggesting that neurogenesis contributes to the effects of antidepressants . However , the molecular mechanisms and pathways involved are not understood . We used Neuro 2A cells transfected with P08908 receptors and SK-N-SH cells endogenously expressing the receptor to examine the effect of receptor activation on neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth . We find that receptor activation leads to increased neurite outgrowth that can be blocked by the receptor selective antagonist and by treatment with pertussis toxin or lactacystin implicating inhibitory G-proteins and proteasomal degradation in this process . Interestingly , the small G-protein Rap and the transcription factor P35610 -3 are also involved since reducing the levels of Rap1 ( using small interfering RNA ) or P35610 -3 ( using dominant negative P40763 ) significantly blocks P08908 -receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth . The observed increase in the phosphorylation of Src and P35610 -3 , at sites leading to their activation , further supports a crucial role for these proteins in neurite outgrowth . We also find that prolonged activation of endogenous P08908 receptors leads to increased cell survival even under starving conditions ; this is completely blocked by co-treatment with the antagonist . Taken together , these findings indicate that activation of the P08908 receptor leads to a number of neurotropic events by activating a series of signal transduction molecules leading to long-term changes required for neurogenesis . Circulating apoptotic proteins are increased in long-term disease-free breast cancer survivors . Circulating apoptotic proteins are increased in patients with heart failure . We evaluated whether circulating soluble ( s ) apoptosis-related proteins and inflammation markers are increased in long-term disease free breast cancer survivors and associated with cardiotoxicity , and if subgroups could be identified based on the applied treatments . Circulating tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha , sTNF-receptor ( sTNF-R ) 1 and 2 , sFas , sFas ligand , sTNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand ( sTRAIL ) and serum P04626 were measured with immunoassay . High-sensitivity P02741 ( HS-CRP ) , fibrinogen , plasma B-type and N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide ( NT- P01160 and DB04899 ) were also determined . Thirty-four patients with median 6.0 years follow-up and 12 healthy age-matched women were enrolled . Chemotherapy , consisting of five cycles fluorouracil , epirubicin ( 90 mg/m(2) ) , cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) ( n=14 ) or four cycles FEC followed by myeloablation with high-dose carboplatin , cyclophosphamide , thiotepa ( n=20 ) , preceded irradiation and tamoxifen . Circulating apoptosis markers were higher in patients than in controls . No associations with cardiac dysfunction were observed . sFas ligand and sTRAIL were higher in the high-dose than in the standard-dose group . In conclusion , we observed increased circulating apoptotic protein levels in long-term disease-free breast cancer survivors , treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy , particularly after myeloablative chemotherapy . The potential relation with late cardiotoxicity of antineoplastic therapy deserves further study . Curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate inhibit the cancer stem cell phenotype via down-regulation of P40763 -NFκB signaling . BACKGROUND/AIM : The cancer stem cell ( CSC ) model postulates the existence of a small proportion of cancer cells capable of sustaining tumor formation , self-renewal and differentiation . Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( P40763 ) signaling is known to be selectively activated in breast CSC populations . However , it is yet to be determined which molecular mechanisms regulate P40763 signaling in CSCs and what chemopreventive agents are effective for suppressing CSC growth . The aim of this study was to examine the potential efficacy of curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) against CSC and to uncover the molecular mechanisms of their anticancer effects . MATERIALS AND METHODS : To suppress the CSC phenotype , two breast cancer cell lines ( MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF7 cells transfected with P04626 ) were treated with curcumin ( 10 μM ) with or without EGCG ( 10 μM ) for 48 h . We used tumor-sphere formation and wound-healing assays to determine CSC phenotype . To quantify CSC populations , Fluorescence-activated cell sorting profiling was monitored . P40763 phosphorylation and interaction with Nuclear Factor-kB ( NFkB ) were analyzed by performing western blot and immunoprecipitation assays . RESULTS : Combined curcumin and EGCG treatment reduced the cancer stem-like Cluster of differentiation 44 ( P16070 ) -positive cell population . Western blot and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that curcumin and EGCG specifically inhibited P40763 phosphorylation and P40763 -NFkB interaction was retained . CONCLUSION : This study suggests that curcumin and EGCG function as antitumor agents for suppressing breast CSCs . P40763 and NFκB signaling pathways could serve as targets for reducing CSCs leading to novel targeted-therapy for treating breast cancer . Human cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced in vitro by P40189 stimulation . OBJECTIVES : Recent in vivo and in vitro studies in animals have demonstrated that cytokines of the P05231 family are involved in cardiac hypertrophy and in protection of cardiomyocytes against apoptosis . The present study aims to analyse the capacity of human atrial cardiac cells ( i.e. , cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts ) to display the P40189 receptor subunit , and to evaluate its functionality . METHODS : Twenty human atrial biopsies were used for immunohistochemistry , in situ hybridisation , and western blot analysis or dissociated for isolation and primary culture of cardiac cells . RESULTS : Fibroblasts present in tissue or maintained in primary culture clearly express P40189 whereas the signal in cardiomyocytes is weaker . Culture of cardiac cells with a P40189 agonist antibody enhances atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , beta myosin heavy chain ( beta-MHC ) expression in cardiomyocytes , and significantly increases the cell surface area microm(2) ) . This process could involve P40763 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate that P40189 activation in human cardiac cells leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy . We discuss several hypotheses on the role of P05231 -type cytokines on cardiomyocyte functions . A new algorithm for weekly phenprocoumon dose variation in a southern Brazilian population : role for P11712 , P08684 /5 and Q9BQB6 genes polymorphisms . DB00946 is widely used in prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders . However , its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics vary according to several genetic and non-genetic factors . DB00946 metabolism is mediated by P11712 and CYP3A enzymes . Moreover , Q9BQB6 is phenprocoumon target of action . Therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in Q9BQB6 , P11712 , P08684 and P20815 genes with the variance of weekly phenprocoumon dose as well as to develop an algorithm for dose prediction based on genetic and environmental factors . A total of 198 patients with stable phenprocoumon dose , 81 % of European ancestry , were investigated . Genotypes were determined by allelic discrimination with TaqMan assays . Polymorphisms -1639G > A and 1173C > T in Q9BQB6 and the presence of P11712 *2 and/or P11712 *3 are associated with lower doses . On the other hand , 3730G > A in Q9BQB6 gene is associated with higher doses . No association was found between P08684 *1B , P20815 *3 and P20815 *6 polymorphisms . Among non-genetic factors , gender , height , age and use of captopril , omeprazole , simvastatin and β-blockers are associated with dose . Two algorithms were derived : one for the whole sample explained 42 % of dose variation and one for patients of European ancestry only which explained 46 % of phenprocoumon dose . The mean absolute difference between observed and predicted dose was low in both models ( 3.92 mg/week and 3.54 mg/week , for models 1 and 2 , respectively ) . However , more studies with other genes and environmental factors are needed to test and to improve the algorithm . Opposing actions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) in regulating microtubule stabilization during cardiac hypertrophy . Excessive proliferation and stabilization of the microtubule ( MT ) array in cardiac myocytes can accompany pathological cardiac hypertrophy , but the molecular control of these changes remains poorly characterized . In this study , we examined MT stabilization in two independent murine models of heart failure and revealed increases in the levels of post-translationally modified stable MTs , which were closely associated with P40763 activation . To explore the molecular signaling events contributing to control of the cardiac MT network , we stimulated cardiac myocytes with an α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine ( PE ) , and observed increased tubulin content without changes in detyrosinated ( glu-tubulin ) stable MTs . In contrast , the hypertrophic interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) family cytokines increased both the glu-tubulin content and glu-MT density . When we examined a role for P29323 in regulating cardiac MTs , we showed that the MEK/ P29323 -inhibitor U0126 increased glu-MT density in either control cardiac myocytes or following exposure to hypertrophic agents . Conversely , expression of an activated Q02750 mutant reduced glu-tubulin levels . Thus , P29323 signaling antagonizes stabilization of the cardiac MT array . In contrast , inhibiting either O60674 with AG490 , or P40763 signaling with Stattic or siRNA knockdown , blocked cytokine-stimulated increases in glu-MT density . Furthermore , the expression of a constitutively active P40763 mutant triggered increased glu-MT density in the absence of hypertrophic stimulation . Thus , P40763 activation contributes substantially to cytokine-stimulated glu-MT changes . Taken together , our results highlight the opposing actions of P40763 and P29323 pathways in the regulation of MT changes associated with cardiac myocyte hypertrophy . Binding of C/EBPbeta to the P02741 ( CRP ) promoter in Hep3B cells is associated with transcription of CRP mRNA . Expression of the acute phase protein P02741 ( CRP ) is tightly regulated in hepatocytes . Although very little CRP mRNA is transcribed normally , inflammatory stimuli are followed by a dramatic increase in mRNA synthesis and accumulation . P05231 and IL-1beta are believed to be the major cytokines responsible for induction of CRP and other acute phase proteins . Our previous studies , using transient transfection and EMSA experiments , implicated involvement of the transcription factors C/EBPbeta , P40763 , Rel p50 , and c-Rel in CRP induction . In the current study we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to determine the kinetics of transcription factor occupancy of these transcription factors on the endogenous CRP promoter . All of these transcription factors were found bound to the endogenous CRP promoter in the absence of cytokines , but cytokine treatment markedly increased binding of only C/EBPbeta . In addition , c-Rel and TATA box-binding protein ( P20226 ) appeared to occupy the promoter in parallel in the presence of cytokines . In the absence of cytokines , CRP mRNA accumulation was not measurable but began to increase by 3 h after exposure of cells to IL-1beta plus P05231 , peaking at 12 h with secondary peaks at 18 and 24 h . The secondary peaks in mRNA expression paralleled the pattern of binding of c-Rel and P20226 to the CRP promoter . We conclude that the CRP promoter has a low level of transcription factor occupancy in the absence of cytokines and induction occurs with binding of C/EBP , and that c-Rel and P20226 are important for modulating CRP expression . Effect of interferon-gamma and P01375 on P15941 mucin expression in ovarian carcinoma cell lines . In view of the potential uses of cell surface tumour associated antigens in novel anticancer treatment , a study was designed to investigate whether the biological response modifiers interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) could effect the expression of an epitope on the tumour associated P15941 epithelial mucin . Four ovarian carcinoma cell lines showing high ( OAW42 and GG ) and low ( JAM and PE01 ) basal expression of P15941 were treated with 10-1000 U/mL of P01579 or P01375 for one or five days . Changes in P15941 expression in cells exposed to P01579 or P01375 were monitored using an ELISA technique with the monoclonal antibody O43633 which reacts with a core protein epitope on the P15941 mucin , and then corrected for the number of viable cells present . P01375 had little effect on P15941 expression , but one or five days exposure to P01579 significantly increased P15941 expression ( p < 0.01 ) in all cell lines including the two cell lines that initially showed little or no expression . Loss of androgen receptor expression promotes a stem-like cell phenotype in prostate cancer through P40763 signaling . P10275 ( AR ) signaling is important for prostate cancer progression . However , androgen-deprivation and/or AR targeting-based therapies often lead to resistance . Here , we demonstrate that loss of AR expression results in P40763 activation in prostate cancer cells . AR downregulation further leads to development of prostate cancer stem-like cells ( CSC ) , which requires P40763 . In human prostate tumor tissues , elevated cancer stem-like cell markers coincide with those cells exhibiting high P40763 activity and low AR expression . AR downregulation-induced P40763 activation is mediated through increased interleukin ( IL ) -6 expression . Treating mice with soluble P05231 receptor fusion protein or silencing P40763 in tumor cells significantly reduced prostate tumor growth and CSCs . Together , these findings indicate an opposing role of AR and P40763 in prostate CSC development . Prolonged treatment with bicalutamide induces androgen receptor overexpression and androgen hypersensitivity . BACKGROUND : Various hormone refractory prostate cancer cell models have been established with androgen depletion and have helped to clarify the mechanism for the transition into androgen-depletion independent status . However , the mechanism of bicalutamide resistance remains unclear because few cell models have been generated . METHODS : We generated a bicalutamide-resistant subline , LNCaP- O43633 , from LNCaP after prolonged treatment with bicalutamide . Androgen and/or bicalutamide responsiveness for proliferation and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) secretion were examined in vitro and in vivo . DB00624 and dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) levels in xenografted tumors were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry . P10275 ( AR ) gene mutation and amplification and AR and pAR(210) expression were determined . RESULTS : LNCaP- O43633 did not grow in an androgen-depleted medium and proliferation was stimulated in a tenfold lower concentration of androgen than that of LNCaP . LNCaP- O43633 grew in castrated male mice , and the DB02901 level in grafted LNCaP- O43633 tumors was 7.7-fold lower than in LNCaP tumors . DB01128 stimulated LNCaP- O43633 proliferation and PSA secretion in vitro and the antitumor activity of bicalutamide against LNCaP- O43633 was weaker than that of LNCaP in vivo . Additional AR mutation and AR gene amplification were not detected in LNCaP- O43633 , but AR and pAR(210) expression and PSA secretion in LNCaP- O43633 were higher than in LNCaP . CONCLUSIONS : DB01128 -resistant LNCaP- O43633 exhibited AR overexpression and hypersensitivity to low levels of androgen . Our data suggests that AR overexpression is a significant mechanism of bicalutamide resistance similar to resistance from chronic androgen depletion . In addition , pAR(210) overexpression could be a potential mechanism for hypersensitivity to low androgen in LNCaP- O43633 . P15056 inhibitors suppress apoptosis through off-target inhibition of JNK signaling . DB08881 and dabrafenib selectively inhibit the P15056 ( P15056 ) kinase , resulting in high response rates and increased survival in melanoma . Approximately 22 % of individuals treated with vemurafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cSCC ) during therapy . The prevailing explanation for this is drug-induced paradoxical P29323 activation , resulting in hyperproliferation . Here we show an unexpected and novel effect of vemurafenib/PLX4720 in suppressing apoptosis through the inhibition of multiple off-target kinases upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , principally Q9NYL2 . JNK signaling is suppressed in multiple contexts , including in cSCC of vemurafenib-treated patients , as well as in mice . Expression of a mutant Q9NYL2 that can not be inhibited reverses the suppression of JNK activation and apoptosis . Our results implicate suppression of JNK-dependent apoptosis as a significant , independent mechanism that cooperates with paradoxical P29323 activation to induce cSCC , suggesting broad implications for understanding toxicities associated with P15056 inhibitors and for their use in combination therapies . DOI : http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00969.001 . Very early-onset lone atrial fibrillation patients have a high prevalence of rare variants in genes previously associated with atrial fibrillation . BACKGROUND : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia . Currently , 14 genes important for ion channel function , intercellular signaling , and homeostatic control have been associated with AF . OBJECTIVE : We hypothesized that rare genetic variants in genes previously associated with AF had a higher prevalence in early-onset lone AF patients than in the background population . METHODS : Sequencing results of P51787 , Q12809 , Q14524 , P22460 , Q9UK17 , P15382 , 2 , 5 , P63252 , P35498 -3B , P01160 , and P36382 from 192 early-onset lone AF patients were compared with data from the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Exome Variant Server consisting of 6503 persons from 18 different cohort studies . RESULTS : Among the lone AF patients , 29 ( 7.6 % ) alleles harbored a novel or very rare variant ( minor allele frequency < 0.1 in the Exome Variant Server ) , a frequency that was significantly higher than what was found in the reference database ( 4.1 % ; with minor allele frequency < 0.1 ; P = .0012 ) . Previously published electrophysiological data showed that 96 % ( n = 23 ) of the rare variants that has been functionally investigated ( n = 24 ) displayed significant functional changes . CONCLUSIONS : We report a much higher prevalence of rare variants in genes associated with AF in early-onset lone AF patients than in the background population . By presenting these data , we believe that we are the first to provide quantitative evidence for the role of rare variants across AF susceptibility genes as a possible pathophysiological substrate for AF . DB06589 inhibits the activation of P09619 β-expressing astrocytes in the brain metastatic microenvironment of breast cancer cells . Brain metastases occur in more than one-third of metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress P04626 or are triple negative . Brain colonization of cancer cells occurs in a unique environment , containing microglia , oligodendrocytes , astrocytes , and neurons . Although a neuroinflammatory response has been documented in brain metastasis , its contribution to cancer progression and therapy remains poorly understood . Using an experimental brain metastasis model , we characterized the brain metastatic microenvironment of brain tropic , P04626 -transfected MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells ( 231-BR- P04626 ) . A previously unidentified subpopulation of metastasis-associated astrocytes expressing phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor β ( at tyrosine 751 ; p751- P09619 β ) was identified around perivascular brain micrometastases . p751- P09619 β(+) astrocytes were also identified in human brain metastases from eight craniotomy specimens and in primary cultures of astrocyte-enriched glial cells . Previously , we reported that pazopanib , a multispecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor , prevented the outgrowth of 231-BR- P04626 large brain metastases by 73 % . Here , we evaluated the effect of pazopanib on the brain neuroinflammatory microenvironment . DB06589 treatment resulted in 70 % ( P = 0.023 ) decrease of the p751- P09619 β(+) astrocyte population , at the lowest dose of 30 mg/kg , twice daily . Collectively , the data identify a subpopulation of activated astrocytes in the subclinical perivascular stage of brain metastases and show that they are inhibitable by pazopanib , suggesting its potential to prevent the development of brain micrometastases in breast cancer patients .
Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone ( P01148 ) -I antagonist cetrorelix inhibits myeloma cell growth in vitro and in vivo . The objective of this study was to determine the effects of an luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) -I antagonist , DB00050 , on human multiple myeloma ( MM ) cells and to elucidate the mechanisms of action . We showed that P01148 -I and P22888 -I genes were expressed in MM cell lines and primary MM cells . Treatment with DB00050 inhibited growth and colony-forming ability of myeloma cells , including cell lines resistant to arsenic trioxide , bortezomib , or lenalidomide . DB00050 induced apoptosis in myeloma cells including primary myeloma cells . In addition , DB00050 inhibited the growth of human myeloma cells xenografted into mice without any apparent side effects . DB00050 downregulated the nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB ) pathway activity and the expression of cytokines , including interleukin 6 , insulin-like growth factor 1 , P15692 , and stromal-derived factor 1 , important for myeloma cell growth and survival in myeloma cells and/or marrow stromal cells from myeloma patients . DB00050 decreased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 and P40763 in myeloma cells , two crucial pathways for myeloma cells growth and survival . Moreover , the expression of P38936 and p53 was increased , whereas that of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) was reduced by DB00050 . Our findings indicate that DB00050 induces cytotoxicity in myeloma cells through various mechanisms and provide a rationale for investigating DB00050 for the treatment of MM . Mutations of the Wilms tumor 1 gene ( P19544 ) in older patients with primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia : a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study . We previously reported the adverse prognostic impact of Wilms tumor 1 gene ( P19544 ) mutations in younger adult cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia ( CN-AML ) . Here , we investigated 243 older ( > or = 60 years ) primary CN-AML patients . P19544 mutated ( WT1mut ) patients ( 7 % ) had P36888 -ITD more frequently ( P < .001 ) , lower hemoglobin ( P = .01 ) , higher white blood cell count ( P = .03 ) and percentage blood blasts ( P = .03 ) , and a shorter overall survival ( P = .08 ) than P19544 wild-type ( WT1wt ) patients . Comparing older and younger WT1mut patients , they had similar pretreatment characteristics and outcome . By contrast , among WT1wt CN-AML , younger patients had a significantly better outcome . A P19544 mutation-associated gene-expression signature , reported here for the first time , included P40200 , a leukemia stem cell-specific marker , and genes involved in gene regulation ( eg , Q03164 , P29590 , and P63162 ) and in proliferative and metabolic processes ( eg , P06213 , Q9Y4H2 , and Q13131 ) , supporting the role of mutated P19544 in deregulating multiple homeostatic processes . Our results indicate that WT1mut CN-AML represents a distinct entity with poor treatment response across age groups . This study has been registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT00900224 . Transcript and protein profiling identifies signaling , growth arrest , apoptosis , and NF-κB survival signatures following P01148 receptor activation . P01148 significantly inhibits proliferation of a proportion of cancer cell lines by activating P01148 receptor ( P30968 ) -G protein signaling . Therefore , manipulation of P30968 signaling may have an under-utilized role in treating certain breast and ovarian cancers . However , the precise signaling pathways necessary for the effect and the features of cellular responses remain poorly defined . We used transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to characterize the effects of P30968 activation in sensitive cells ( HEK293- P30968 , SCL60 ) in vitro and in vivo , compared to unresponsive HEK293 . Analyses of gene expression demonstrated a dynamic response to the P01148 superagonist DB06825 . Early and mid-phase changes ( 0.5-1.0 h ) comprised mainly transcription factors . Later changes ( 8-24 h ) included a P01148 target gene , P01215 , and up- or downregulation of transcripts encoding signaling and cell division machinery . Pathway analysis identified altered MAPK and cell cycle pathways , consistent with occurrence of G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) pathway gene transcripts were differentially expressed between control and DB06825 -treated SCL60 cultures . Reverse-phase protein and phospho-proteomic array analyses profiled responses in cultured cells and SCL60 xenografts in vivo during DB06825 anti-proliferation . Increased phosphorylated NF-κB ( p65 ) occurred in SCL60 in vitro , and p-NF-κB and IκBε were higher in treated xenografts than controls after 4 days DB06825 . NF-κB inhibition enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of DB06825 in SCL60 cultures . This study reveals details of pathways interacting with intense P30968 signaling , identifies potential anti-proliferative target genes , and implicates the NF-κB survival pathway as a node for enhancing P01148 agonist-induced anti-proliferation . DB01370 alters iron and manganese uptake and regulation of surface transferrin receptors in primary rat oligodendrocyte cultures . P02787 ( Tf ) is a major transport protein for both iron ( Fe ) and aluminum ( Al ) , as well as manganese ( Mn ) and it can mediate cellular uptake of these elements via cell surface Tf receptors . To study the effect of Al-Tf on Tf receptor regulation , primary oligodendrocyte cultures were prepared from cortices of newborn rats . The effects of Al-Tf on 54Mn and 59Fe uptake were compared to those of apo- , Fe- , or Mn-Tf ( 1.25 microM ) . To examine changes in cell surface Tf binding capacity , preincubation ( 4 h , 37 degrees C ) was performed with apo- , Al- or Fe-Tf and homologous receptor binding studies were subsequently conducted with 125I-Fe-Tf at 4 degrees C . Incubation with Al-Tf , but not with equimolar amounts of Al chloride or Al citrate , led to dose-related increases in cellular Al . Incubation with either Al- or Fe-Tf decreased 59Fe uptake , while incubation with either Al- or Mn-Tf decreased 54Mn uptake . Surface Tf receptor sites/cell were 1.05 , 0.60 and 0.46 x 10(5) after incubations with equivalent amounts of apo- , Fe- , and Al-Tf respectively . The data suggest that Al-Tf down-regulates surface Tf receptors on oligodendrocytes and can limit Fe and Mn uptake through this mechanism . A study on co-localization of DB00094 and its receptor in rat hippocampus . It has been known that DB00644 , LH and their receptors exist in hippocampal neurons . However , whether DB00094 and its receptor also exist in hippocampal neurons remained unknown yet . In situ hybridization , double-labeled immunofluorescence stain and double-labeled immunohistochemistry stain in adjacent sections were used in our research to study the distribution , co-localization of DB00094 and its receptor and co-localization of DB00094 and P30968 in rat hippocampus . The result found that pyramidal neurons from P00915 to P22748 region and granule neurons in dentate gyrus could express DB00094 and its receptor , majority of hippocampal neurons co-expressed DB00094 and its receptor , DB00094 and P30968 . These suggested that hippocampal neurons not only express DB00094 but also act as DB00094 target cells . DB00094 may regulate the function of hippocampal neurons by ways of paracrine or autocrine . At the same time , DB00644 may regulate the function of DB00094 neuron in hippocampus through P30968 . Novel structural features of CDK inhibition revealed by an ab initio computational method combined with dynamic simulations . The rational development of specific inhibitors for the approximately 500 protein kinases encoded in the human genome is impeded by a poor understanding of the structural basis for the activity and selectivity of small molecules that compete for DB00171 binding . Combining classical dynamic simulations with a novel ab initio computational approach linear-scalable to molecular interactions involving thousands of atoms , we have investigated the binding of five distinct inhibitors to the cyclin-dependent kinase P24941 . We report here that polarization and dynamic hydrogen bonding effects , so far undetected by crystallography , affect both their activity and selectivity . The effects arise from the specific solvation patterns of water molecules in the DB00171 binding pocket or the intermittent formation of hydrogen bonds during the dynamics of CDK/inhibitor interactions and explain the unexpectedly high potency of certain inhibitors such as 3-(3H-imidazol-4-ylmethylene)-5-methoxy-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one ( DB03428 ) . The Lys89 residue in the DB00171 -binding pocket of P24941 is observed to form temporary hydrogen bonds with the three most potent inhibitors . This residue is replaced in P11802 by Thr89 , whose shorter side-chain can not form similar bonds , explaining the relative selectivity of the inhibitors for P24941 . Our results provide a generally applicable computational method for the analysis of biomolecular structures and reveal hitherto unrecognized features of the interaction between protein kinases and their inhibitors . The Lyme disease vaccine takes its toll . Vaccination with Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein ( Osp ) A can induce a protective response against Lyme disease and serves as a model to understand the generation of protective immune responses against the spirochete . The innate response to pathogens is activated by specific Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) that recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns . O60603 is of particular interest for B. burgdorferi research because O60603 recognizes several pathogen-associated molecular patterns , including lipoproteins . O60603 may form heterodimers with Q9Y2C9 to identify diacylated lipoproteins , while O60603 works in concert with Q15399 to recognize triacylated lipoproteins such as OspA . We will discuss the role of Q15399 /2 in the development of responses to OspA in Q15399 -and O60603 -deficient mice , and in selected individuals that received the OspA vaccine . While > 95 % of human OspA-based Lyme disease vaccine recipients develop OspA antibodies , a very small group of individuals did not develop detectable humoral responses against OspA . We demonstrated that this hyporesponsiveness to OspA vaccination was associated with decreased cell surface expression of Q15399 . Moreover , Q15399 - and O60603 -deficient mice did not develop significant levels of OspA antibodies following vaccination with OspA , providing a correlation with human hyporesponsiveness to OspA . These data suggest that defects in the Q15399 /2 signaling pathway are associated with an impaired ability to generate antibodies following immunization with DB00045 . Chronic delivery of a thrombospondin-1 mimetic decreases skeletal muscle capillarity in mice . Angiogenesis is an essential process for normal skeletal muscle function . There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that thrombospondin-1 ( P07996 -1 ) , a potent antiangiogenic protein in tumorigenesis , is an important regulator of both physiological and pathological skeletal muscle angiogenesis . We tested the hypothesis that chronic exposure to a P07996 -1 mimetic ( DB05434 ) , which targets the P16671 P07996 -1 receptor , would decrease skeletal muscle capillarity as well as alter the balance between positive and negative angiogenic proteins under basal conditions . Osmotic minipumps with either DB05434 or vehicle ( 5 % dextrose ) were implanted subcutaneously in the subscapular region of C57/BL6 mice for 14 days . When compared to the vehicle treated mice , the DB05434 group had a 20 % decrease in capillarity in the superficial region of the gastrocnemius ( GA ) , 11 % decrease in the plantaris ( Q02083 ) , and a 35 % decrease in the soleus ( SOL ) . DB05434 also decreased muscle protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) in both the GA ( -140 % ) and SOL ( -62 % ) ; however there was no change in P15692 in the Q02083 . Serum P15692 was not altered in DB05434 treated animals . Endogenous P07996 -1 protein expression in all muscles remained unaltered . Tunnel staining revealed no difference in muscle apoptosis between DB05434 and vehicle treated groups . These data provide evidence that the anti-angiogenic effects of P07996 -1 are mediated , at least in part , via the P16671 receptor . It also suggests that under physiologic conditions the P07996 -1/ P16671 axis plays a role in regulating basal skeletal muscle microvessel density . Comparison of lipopeptide-based immunocontraceptive vaccines containing different lipid groups . We have previously shown that incorporating the lipid moiety dipalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine ( Pam2Cys ) into peptide structures effectively adjuvants otherwise weak immunogens . In this study lipopeptides based on luteinising hormone releasing hormone ( P01148 ) as a B cell epitope , [ B ] , were synthesised in tandem with a 17-residue T-helper epitope , [ T ] , derived from the fusion protein of the morbillivirus canine distemper virus . In this way vaccine candidates with the structure [ T ] -[B] were produced . These peptides were then lipidated with different diacylated moieties . The acyl moieties used were : palmitic acid ( C16 ) to give Pam2Cys , stearic acid ( C18 ) to give Ste2Cys , lauric acid ( C12 ) to give Lau2Cys and DB04519 ( Q99618 ) to give Oct2Cys . We compared the immunogenicities of these simple lipopeptides in BALB/c mice by measuring their ability to induce anti- P01148 antibodies and found that immunogenicity was dependent on the length of the alkane chains of the incorporated lipid moieties with the hierarchy C16=C18 > C12 > Q99618 . The antibody levels elicited by the lipopeptides also correlated with their ability to inhibit the reproductive capability of female mice in fertility trials . Furthermore , the C16 lipopeptide was the most effective in activating dendritic cells , measured by up regulation of surface MHC Class II molecules , and also in activating NF-kappaB in a Toll-like receptor-2 ( O60603 ) -dependent manner . Effects of phenacetin and its metabolite p-phenetidine on P23219 and P35354 activities and expression in vitro . The present study was aimed to test the possible cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1/ P35354 selectivity of the old analgesic drug phenacetin and its metabolite p-phenetidine , which exhibits high renal toxicity . DB00316 ( acetaminophen ) , the main metabolite of phenacetin with low renal toxicity , and indomethacin were selected as reference compounds . Collagen-stimulated platelet thromboxane B2 ( TxB2 ) production and phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced neutrophil prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) synthesis were used as indicators for P23219 and P35354 activity , respectively . DB03783 was even less potent than paracetamol to reduce the production of both TxB2 and DB00917 , and no clear preference for either of the P36551 -enzymes was seen . P-phenetidine was a more potent inhibitor , already at nanomolar level , of the synthesis of these prostanoids than indomethacin and showed some preference to P35354 inhibition . Somewhat higher , micromolar , concentrations of p-phenetidine also reduced P35354 expression in neutrophils . We suggest that the very potent inhibitory activity of p-phenetidine on DB00917 synthesis combined with the reduction of P35354 expression could explain the renal papillary necrosis in phenacetin kidney . DB00644 1 directly affects corpora lutea lifespan in Mediterranean buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis ) during diestrus : presence and in vitro effects on enzymatic and hormonal activities . The expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) receptor ( P30968 ) and the direct role of P01148 on corpora lutea function were studied in Mediterranean buffalo during diestrus . Immunohistochemistry evidenced at early , mid , and late luteal stages the presence of P30968 only in large luteal cells and P01148 in both small and large luteal cells . Real-time PCR revealed P30968 and P01148 mRNA at the three luteal stages , with lowest values in late corpora lutea . In vitro corpora lutea progesterone production was greater in mid stages and lesser in late luteal phases , whereas prostaglandin F2 alpha ( PGF2alpha ) increased from early to late stages , and DB00917 was greater in the earlier-luteal phase . Cyclooxygenase 1 ( prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 ; P23219 ) activity did not change during diestrus , whereas P35354 increased from early to late stages , and DB00917 -9-ketoreductase ( DB00917 -9-K ) was greater in late corpora lutea . P23219 activity was greater than P35354 in early corpora lutea and lesser in late luteal phase . In corpora lutea cultured in vitro , the P01148 analog ( buserelin ) reduced progesterone secretion and increased PGF2alpha secretion as well as P35354 and DB00917 -9-K activities at mid and late stages . DB00917 release and P23219 activity were increased by buserelin only in late corpora lutea . These results suggest that P01148 is expressed in all luteal cells of buffalo , whereas P30968 is only expressed in large luteal phase . Additionally , P01148 directly down-regulates corpora lutea progesterone release , with the concomitant increases of PGF2alpha production and P35354 and DB00917 -9-K enzymatic activities . Activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors induces a long-term enhancement of excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors in the rat hippocampus . Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from P00915 pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus to study the modulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) on synaptic transmission mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors . DB00007 ( 10(-9)-10(-7) M ) , a specific DB00644 analog , concentration-dependently elicited a long-lasting potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors . P30968 -induced synaptic potentiation was blocked by 1 microM [ Acetyl-3,4-dehydro-Pro1,D-p-F-Phe2,D-Trp3,6 ] - P01148 , a specific P30968 antagonist . Furthermore , P30968 -induced synaptic potentiation was associated with the stimulation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , being considerably attenuated by a potent PKC inhibitor ( 30 microM H-7 ) . The results suggest a long-term enhanced modulation of DB00644 on synaptic transmission mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors , possibly via the actions of PKC in the hippocampus that is an important integrative system in the regulation of reproductive processes . P05019 stimulates human intestinal smooth muscle cell growth by regulation of P55008 phase cell cycle proteins . Autocrine production of insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) regulates growth of human intestinal muscle cells by activation of distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 -kinase ) -dependent and P27361 /2-dependent pathways . The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanisms by which P05019 regulates the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and muscle cell proliferation . Incubation of quiescent cells with P05019 stimulated time-dependent cell cycle progression measured by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine . Studies using a microarray-based approach were used initially to identify genes expressed in human intestinal muscle encoding proteins known to participate in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle that were regulated by P05019 . Incubation of muscle cells for 24 h with P05019 elicited greater than fivefold increase in the expression of cyclin D1 and greater than twofold increase in retinoblastoma protein ( Rb1 ) . P05019 elicited a time-dependent increase in cyclin D1 protein levels mediated jointly by P27361 /2-dependent and P19957 -kinase-dependent mechanisms . Increase in cyclin D1 levels was accompanied by a time-dependent increase in cyclin D1-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase-4 ( P11802 ) activity . P05019 also elicited a rapid time-dependent increase in Rb-(Ser807/811) phosphorylation , the specific target of the cyclin D(1)-dependent P11802 kinase , and a slower increase in total Rb protein levels . We conclude that P05019 stimulates G(1) phase progression , DNA synthesis , and cell proliferation of human intestinal smooth muscle cells . Effects of P05019 on proliferation are mediated jointly by P27361 /2-dependent and P19957 -kinase-dependent pathways that regulate cyclin D1 levels , P11802 activity , and Rb activity . DB00644 agonists reduce the migratory and the invasive behavior of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by interfering with the activity of P05019 . Androgen-independent prostate carcinoma is characterized by a high proliferation rate and by a strong metastatic behavior . We have previously shown that DB00644 agonists exert a direct and specific inhibitory action on the proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells ( DU 145 ) . These compounds mainly act by interfering with the mitogenic activity of growth factors , such as the insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) . The present experiments were performed to clarify whether DB00644 agonists might also affect the migratory and the invasive behavior of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and to define their mechanism of action . First we showed that the DB00644 agonist DB00007 reduces the migration of DU 145 cells towards a chemoattractant and their ability to invade a reconstituted basement membrane . Experiments were then performed to clarify whether the DB00644 agonist might act by interfering with the pro-metastatic activity of P05019 . We found that , in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells , DB00007 : a ) interferes with the P05019 system ( receptor protein expression and tyrosine-phosphorylation ) ; b ) abrogates the P05019 -induced phosphorylation of Akt ( a kinase previously shown by us to mediate the pro-metastatic activity of P05019 in prostate cancer cells ) ; c ) counteracts the migration and the invasive activity of the cells stimulated by P05019 ; d ) abolishes the effects of P05019 on cell morphology , on actin cytoskeleton organization and on alphavbeta3 integrin expression/cellular localization . These data indicate that DB00644 agonists , in addition to their well known antiproliferative effect , can also exert a significant inhibitory activity on the migratory and invasive behavior of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells , expressing the P30968 . DB00644 agonists act by interfering with the pro-metastatic activity of the growth factor P05019 . The bovine 5' AMPK gene family : mapping and single nucleotide polymorphism detection . The DB00131 -activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) family is an ancient stress response system whose primary function is regulation of cellular DB00171 . Activation of AMPK , which is instigated by environmental and nutritional stresses , initiates energy-conserving measures that protect the cell by inhibition and phosphorylation of key enzymes in energy-consuming biochemical pathways . The seven genes that comprise the bovine AMPK family were mapped in cattle by using a radiation hybrid panel . The seven genes mapped to six different cattle chromosomes , each with a LOD score greater than 10.0 . Q13131 mapped to BTA 20 , P54646 and O43741 to BTA 3 , Q9Y478 to BTA 17 , P54619 to BTA 5 , Q9UGJ0 to BTA 4 , and Q9UGI9 to BTA 2 . Five of the seven genes mapped to regions expected from human/cattle comparative maps . O43741 and Q9UGI9 , however , have not been mapped in humans . We predict these genes to be located on HSA 1 and 2 , respectively . Additionally , one synonymous and one non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) were detected in Q9UGI9 in Bos taurus cattle . In an effort to determine ancestral origins , various herds of mixed breed cattle as well as other ruminant species were characterized for sequence variation in this region of Q9UGI9 . Owing to the physiological importance of this gene family , we believe that its individual genes are candidate genes for conferring resistance to diseases in cattle . Physiological and enzymatic properties of the ram epididymal soluble form of germinal angiotensin I-converting enzyme . The 94-kDa ram epididymal fluid form of the sperm membrane-derived germinal angiotensin I-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) was purified by chromatography , and some of its enzymatic properties were studied . For the artificial substrate furanacryloyl-L-phenylalanylglycylglycine ( FAPGG ) , the enzyme exhibited a Michaelis constant ( K(m) ) of 0.18 mM and a V(max) of 34 micromoles/ ( min x mg ) and for hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine a K(m) of 2.65 mM and a V(max) of 163 micromoles/ ( min x mg ) under the defined standard conditions ( 300 mM NaCl and 50 mM DB03754 ; pH 7.5 and 8.3 , respectively ) . The FAPGG hydrolysis was decreased by 82.5 % and 67.5 % by DB00974 and dithioerythritol , respectively , and was totally inhibited by specific P12821 inhibitors such as captopril , P- DB00142 - DB00150 -Pro- DB00125 -Pro- DB00142 - DB00167 -Pro-Pro , and lisinopril . Optimum activity for FAPGG was with pH 6.0 , 50 mM chloride , and 500 microM zinc . Under the various conditions tested , bradykinin , angiotensin ( Ang ) I , Ang II , and P01148 were competitors for FAPGG . Bradykinin and angiotensin I were the best competitors . The enzyme cleaved Ang I into Ang II , and the optimal conditions were with pH 7.5 and 300 mM chloride . The relationship between the carboxypeptidase activity in seminal plasma and the prediction of fertility of young rams was also studied . These results indicated a correlation between sperm concentration and P12821 activity in semen but showed no statistically significant correlation between such activity and fertility of the animal . Finally , we tested the role of P12821 in fertilization ; no difference in the in vitro fertilization rate was observed in the presence of 10(-4) M captopril . Structures of murine carbonic anhydrase IV and human carbonic anhydrase II complexed with brinzolamide : molecular basis of isozyme-drug discrimination . P22748 ( CAIV ) is a membrane-associated enzyme anchored to plasma membrane surfaces by a phosphatidylinositol glycan linkage . We have determined the 2.8-angstroms resolution crystal structure of a truncated , soluble form of recombinant murine CAIV . We have also determined the structure of its complex with a drug used for glaucoma therapy , the sulfonamide inhibitor brinzolamide ( DB01194 ) . The overall structure of murine CAIV is generally similar to that of human CAIV ; however , some local structural differences are found in the active site resulting from amino acid sequence differences in the " 130 's segment " and the residue-63 loop ( these may affect the nearby catalytic proton shuttle , DB00117 -64 ) . Similar to human CAIV , the C-terminus of murine CAIV is surrounded by a substantial electropositive surface potential that may stabilize the interaction with the phospholipid membrane . Binding interactions observed for brinzolamide rationalize the generally weaker affinity of inhibitors used in glaucoma therapy toward CAIV compared with CAII . P00797 -angiotensin system modulation : the weight of evidence . Modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is considered to be the most complete way to manage high-risk patients including those with hypertension . P12821 ( P12821 ) inhibitors are effective at reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients with overt clinical heart failure , asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction , and uncomplicated myocardial infarction . Furthermore , recent trials like the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluations ( HOPE ) study and the EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with DB00790 in stable coronary Artery disease ( EUROPA ) support extending the use of P12821 inhibitors to the routine/first-line treatment of patients with an increased global cardiovascular risk . Although some investigators have seen the development of angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs ) as a more effective and tolerable way of reproducing the benefits of P12821 inhibition , there remain important concerns regarding the distinct pharmacologic profiles and modes of action of these two classes of drugs . Careful evaluation of data from recent large-scale studies revealed that , unlike P12821 inhibitors , ARBs are either neutral or may actually increase rates of myocardial infarction despite similar levels of blood pressure reduction . The fact that this effect is most apparent when ARBs are compared with placebo in the absence of concomitant P12821 inhibitors suggests that differential effects on the angiotensin II type 2 ( AT(2) ) receptors may be important . Other important pharmacologic differences are also known to be present and may be of direct relevance . The weight of available evidence therefore supports the use of appropriate P12821 inhibitor regimens , although not ARBs , in the treatment of global cardiovascular risk . Use of plasma somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I measurements to monitor the response to nutritional repletion in malnourished patients . Changes in plasma somatomedia-C/insulin-like growth factor I ( Sm-C/ P05019 ) concentrations are a sensitive indicator of the anabolic response of normal human volunteers to alterations in nutritional intake . To determine if measurement of this peptide could be used to monitor the response to nutritional repletion in malnourished patients , six patients were studied while receiving nutritional support for periods of 10-16 days . Plasma Sm-C/ P05019 increased from a mean basal level of 0.67 +/- 0.15 U/ml ( +/-1 SD ) to a peak of 1.80 +/- 0.44 U/ml on day 10 , then declined to a concentration of 1.28 +/- 0.49 U/ml by day 16 . All patients entered positive nitrogen balance by day 2 and nitrogen accretion continued throughout the study . Changes in serum concentrations of prealbumin , transferrin , and retinol-binding protein were compared to changes in Sm-C/ P05019 during nutritional support . P02766 increased to a posttreatment mean of 121 +/- 23 % of control by the end of the study ( p greater than 0.05 , NS ) . Likewise , there was minimal change in retinol-binding protein , a peak value of 118 +/- 21 % of control being reached by day 12 of treatment ( p greater than 0.05 , NS ) . P02787 also showed minimal change , increasing to a mean value of 110 % +/- 13 % of control by day 12 ( p greater than 0.05 , NS ) . Measurement of plasma Sm-C/ P05019 concentrations appears to be a much more sensitive index of acute directional changes in nutritional status than other plasma proteins commonly used to monitor nutritional responses . The increase of Sm-C/ P05019 correlated temporally with entry into positive nitrogen balance. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Twisting immune responses for allogeneic stem cell therapy . Stem cell-derived tissues and organs have the potential to change modern clinical science . However , rejection of allogeneic grafts by the host 's immune system is an issue which needs to be addressed before embryonic stem cell-derived cells or tissues can be used as medicines . Mismatches in human leukocyte class I antigens and minor histocompatibility antigens are the central factors that are responsible for various graft-versus-host diseases . Traditional strategies usually involve suppressing the whole immune systems with drugs . There are many side effects associated with these methods . Here , we discuss an emerging strategy for manipulating the central immune tolerance by naturally " introducing " donor antigens to a host so a recipient can acquire tolerance specifically to the donor cells or tissues . This strategy has two distinct stages . The first stage restores the thymic function of adult patients with sex steroid inhibitory drugs ( P01148 -A ) , keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) , interleukin 7 ( P13232 ) and P07333 -like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) . The second stage introduces hematopoietic stem cells and their downstream progenitors to the restored thymus by direct injection . Hematopoietic stem cells are used to introduce donor antigens because they have priority access to the thymus . We also review several clinical cases to explain this new strategy .
DB00741 is a suppressor of apoptosis in bovine corpus luteum . Glucocorticoid ( GC ) acts as a modulator of physiological functions in several organs . In the present study , we examined whether GC suppresses luteolysis in bovine corpus luteum ( CL ) . DB00741 ( an active GC ) reduced the mRNA expression of caspase 8 ( Q14790 ) and caspase 3 ( P42574 ) and reduced the enzymatic activity of P42574 and cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and interferon gamma ( P01579 ) in cultured bovine luteal cells . mRNAs and proteins of GC receptor ( P04150 ) , 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( P28845 ) , and P80365 were expressed in CL throughout the estrous cycle . Moreover , the protein expression and the enzymatic activity of P28845 were high at the early and the midluteal stages compared to the regressed luteal stage . These results suggest that cortisol suppresses P01375 - P01579 -induced apoptosis in vitro by reducing apoptosis signals via Q14790 and P42574 in bovine CL and that the local increase in cortisol production resulting from increased P28845 at the early and midluteal stages helps to maintain CL function by suppressing apoptosis of luteal cells . FTY720 induces apoptosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells via dual activation of O43521 and P55957 and overcomes various types of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . PP2A activator FTY720 has been shown to possess the anti-leukemic activity for chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , however , the cell killing mechanism underlying its anti-leukemic activity has remained to be verified . We investigated the precise mechanisms underlying the apoptosis induction by FTY720 , especially focusing on the roles of BH3-only proteins , and the therapeutic potency of FTY720 for CML . Enforced expression of either P10415 or the dominant-negative protein of Q13158 ( Q13158 .DN ) partly protected CML cells from apoptosis by FTY720 , indicating the involvement of both cell extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways . FTY720 activates pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins : O43521 , which is essential for apoptosis by P11274 - P00519 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , and P55957 , which accelerates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway . Gene knockdown of either O43521 or P55957 partly protected K562 cells from apoptosis by FTY720 , but the extent of cell protection was not as much as that by overexpression of either P10415 or Q13158 .DN . Moreover , knockdown of both O43521 and P55957 did not provide additional protection compared with knockdown of only O43521 or P55957 , indicating that O43521 and P55957 complement each other in apoptosis by FTY720 , especially when either is functionally impaired . FTY720 can overcome TKI resistance caused by P00519 kinase domain mutations , dysfunction of O43521 resulting from gene deletion polymorphism , and galectin-3 overexpression . In addition , DB05764 , a BH3-mimetic , significantly augmented cell death induction by FTY720 both in TKI-sensitive and -resistant leukemic cells . These results provide the rationale that FTY720 , with its unique effects on O43521 and P55957 , could lead to new therapeutic strategies for CML . Normal and perturbed endothelial cells from canine femoral arteries and femoral veins exhibit heterogeneity in hemostatic properties and growth characteristics . BACKGROUND : We sought to examine the heterogeneity of endothelial cells from the same anatomic site but different vascular systems and described P04275 ( P04275 ) release and morphological change in response to injury-associated factor in femoral vessels from canine in vitro . METHODS : Levels of hemostatic factors ( P04275 , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1( P05121 ) , antithrombin III ( P01008 ) , in tissue sections and cultured endothelial cells of canine femoral arteries and canine femoral veins were compared by the immunohistochemistry technique . In addition to comparing cell growth density and cell protein contents , cultured femoral arterial endothelial cells ( FAECs ) and cultured femoral venous endothelial cells ( FVECs ) were incubated with a series concentration of basic fibroblast factor ( P09038 ) ( 1 , 10 , 100 ng/ml ) for up to 48 hours to test the amount of P04275 secretion and morphological change . RESULTS : Both in tissue sections and cultured cells , the levels of P04275 are higher in FVECs than in FAECs . We were unable to differentiate the level of P05121 and P01008 difference between FAECs and FVECs. P09038 ( 10 ng/ml ) significantly increased P04275 secretion from cultured FAECs but not from FVECs . The size of cultured FAECs is smaller than of FVECs ; however , FAECs have higher amounts of protein contents than FVECs . CONCLUSIONS : These comparative studies provide evidence indicating that the characteristics of FVECs differ from those of FAECs . These differences may be indicated heterogeneity with either inherited or acquired thrombotic disease . aChE and BuChE inhibition by rivastigmin have no effect on peripheral insulin resistance in elderly patients with Alzheimer disease . BACKGROUND : P01308 resistance ( IR ) may play a role in most pathogenic processes that promote the development of Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ( LOAD ) . This study was designed to determine the interaction between inhibition of both butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) and acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) with rivastigmine and peripheral insulin resistance ( IR ) in LOAD . METHODS : Seventy-Nine consecutive elderly patients , 31 late onset AD and 48 non-demented patients were evaluated . IR was calculated with HOMA . All of the patients were evaluated through comprehensive geriatric assessments at baseline and in the 6th and 12th months . RESULTS : End of the study , compared to the baseline values , there was a significant increase in the 6th month in both MMSE and IADL scores ( t =2.200 , p = 0.036 for MMSE and t =2.724 , p= 0.011 for IADL , respectively ) . DB00989 was improved both the scores of MMSE and IADL in elderly patients with LOAD , but there was no significance or correlation between HOMA scores and cognitive status . CONCLUSION : In conclusion , inhibition of both BuChE and P22303 with rivastigmine was improved the cognition without affecting on the peripheral IR in the elderly patients with LOAD by HOMA . Due to the complexity of disease pathogenesis , it is too early to make general comments , and further longitudinal and long-term studies on this issue are needed . Effect of canagliflozin on renal threshold for glucose , glycemia , and body weight in normal and diabetic animal models . BACKGROUND : DB08907 is a sodium glucose co-transporter ( SGLT ) 2 inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . METHODS : (14)C-alpha-methylglucoside uptake in Chinese hamster ovary-K cells expressing human , rat , or mouse SGLT2 or P13866 ; (3)H-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in Q9BTT4 myoblasts ; and 2-electrode voltage clamp recording of oocytes expressing human SGLT3 were analyzed . Graded glucose infusions were performed to determine rate of urinary glucose excretion ( UGE ) at different blood glucose ( BG ) concentrations and the renal threshold for glucose excretion ( RT(G) ) in vehicle or canagliflozin-treated Zucker diabetic fatty ( ZDF ) rats . This study aimed to characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of canagliflozin in vitro and in preclinical models of T2DM and obesity . RESULTS : Treatment with canagliflozin 1 mg/kg lowered RT(G) from 415±12 mg/dl to 94±10 mg/dl in ZDF rats while maintaining a threshold relationship between BG and UGE with virtually no UGE observed when BG was below RT(G) . DB08907 dose-dependently decreased BG concentrations in db/db mice treated acutely . In ZDF rats treated for 4 weeks , canagliflozin decreased glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and improved measures of insulin secretion . In obese animal models , canagliflozin increased UGE and decreased BG , body weight gain , epididymal fat , liver weight , and the respiratory exchange ratio . CONCLUSIONS : DB08907 lowered RT(G) and increased UGE , improved glycemic control and beta-cell function in rodent models of T2DM , and reduced body weight gain in rodent models of obesity . Activity of retinoic acid receptor-gamma selectively binding retinoids alone and in combination with interferon-gamma in breast cancer cell lines . Retinoids modulate several cell functions and especially inhibit the growth of a wide variety of cells including breast cancer . Retinoic acid receptor-gamma ( P13631 ) has been shown to mediate the antiproliferative activity of retinoids . To further test this hypothesis we examined the effects of different P13631 selectively binding retinoids ( CD2325 , CD2247 , CD666 and CD437 ) on breast cancer cell lines . With exception of CD2247 , all retinoids inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 , SKBR-3 , T47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines , similar to the natural compound all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) . In addition , all 4 compounds were able to act synergistically with interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) in all breast cancer cell lines including the retinoid-resistant BT-20 and 734-B lines . In functional transactivation assays we demonstrated that only in the MCF-7 cell line , TPA-mediated AP-1 activity was suppressed only by DB00755 and CD2325 , whereas in SKBR-3 , another RA-sensitive breast cancer cell line , it was not . The synergistic antiproliferative activity involving retinoids and P01579 could not be explained by an enhanced anti-AP-1 activity . No correlation was found between expression of RARs and cellular retinoic acid binding proteins ( CRABPs ) and antiproliferative effects of the retinoids . P13631 selectively binding retinoids are potent inhibitors of breast cancer cell proliferation , alone and in combination with P01579 . For this reason and because of a possible low toxicity , as compared with retinoic acid , we speculate that these P13631 selective binding retinoids might be of clinical importance . Antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy of P35354 specific inhibition : from investigational trials to clinical experience . Research strongly indicates that increased expression of the isoenzyme cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) is responsible for elevated production of prostaglandins in inflamed joint tissues and is involved in the mediation of pain . In contrast , P23219 is a constitutively produced isoenzyme that is involved in the synthesis of eicosanoids that have important homeostatic functions , for example , in the gastric mucosa and platelets . This new knowledge led to the development of drugs that are highly specific inhibitors of P35354 while not inhibiting P23219 at maximally efficacious dosages . The first P35354 specific agent approved for clinical use in the United States was celecoxib . Large multicenter trials have shown that celecoxib at dosages of 100 mg P55957 and 200 mg P55957 is as effective as naproxen 500 mg P55957 in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip . Another large multicenter trial also demonstrated that celecoxib 200 mg P43251 and 400 mg P55957 is as effective as naproxen 500 mg P55957 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . A comparative trial showed that celecoxib 200 mg P55957 is as effective as diclofenac SR 75 mg P55957 in patients with RA . The potential of P35354 specific inhibitors to provide antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy equivalent to that of conventional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs without the adverse gastrointestinal mucosal and platelet effects associated with nonspecific P36551 inhibitors promises to revolutionize the clinical care of arthritis patients . NT-702 ( parogrelil hydrochloride , DB05505 ) , a novel and potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor , improves reduced walking distance and lowered hindlimb plantar surface temperature in a rat experimental intermittent claudication model . NT-702 ( parogrelil hydrochloride , DB05505 ) , 4-bromo-6-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)propoxy]-5-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)amino]pyridazin-3(2H)-one hydrochloride , a novel phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) inhibitor synthesized as a potent vasodilatory and antiplatelet agent , is being developed for the treatment of intermittent claudication ( IC ) in patients with peripheral arterial disease . We assessed the efficacy of NT-702 in an experimental IC model as compared with cilostazol and additionally investigated the pharmacological property in vitro and ex vivo . NT-702 selectively inhibited PDE3 ( IC(50)=0.179 and 0.260 nM for Q14432 and 3B ) more potently than cilostazol ( IC(50)=231 and 237 nM for Q14432 and 3B ) among recombinant human PDE1 to PDE6 . NT-702 inhibited in vitro human platelet aggregation induced by various agonists ( IC(50)=11 to 67 nM ) and phenylephrine-induced rat aortic contraction ( IC(50)=24 nM ) . Corresponding results for cilostazol were 4.1 to 17 microM and 1.0 microM , respectively . NT-702 ( 3 mg/kg or more ) significantly inhibited ex vivo rat platelet aggregation after a single oral dose . For cilostazol , 300 mg/kg was effective . In a rat femoral artery ligation model , NT-702 at 5 and 10 mg/kg repeated oral doses twice a day ( P55957 ) for 13 days significantly improved the reduced walking distance while the lowered plantar surface temperature was improved at 2.5 mg/kg and more . DB01166 also improved the walking distance and surface temperature at 300 mg/kg P55957 but significant difference was only observed for surface temperature on day 8 . These results suggest that NT-702 can be expected to have therapeutic advantage for IC . Microarray analysis of cytokine activation of apoptosis pathways in the thyroid . It has been suggested that Fas-mediated apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases . Our previous studies have demonstrated that normal primary thyroid epithelial cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis , but the resistance can be overcome by pretreatment with a combination of interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) and IL-1beta . To understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the P01579 /IL-1beta effects , we profiled changes in the transcription induced by these two cytokines in normal human thyroid cells , using cDNA microarrays . We found that P01579 /IL-1beta showed a significant increase in apoptosis-related genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , receptor-interacting protein 2 ( O43353 ) , and caspases 10 . These increases were confirmed by other methods , including real-time PCR and Western blot . Furthermore , the sensitization of primary thyroid epithelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis by P01579 /IL-1beta was significantly blocked by a general caspase inhibitor , z-VAD , or by the combination of two specific individual caspase inhibitors . In addition , our results showed that P01579 /IL-1beta enhance p38 MAPK phosphorylation and that SB 203580 , a p38 MAPK inhibitor , can inhibit P01579 /IL-1beta-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation . SB 203580 also significantly prevented cytokine-induced P35228 expression and caspase activation and thus blocked Fas-mediated apoptosis of thyroid cells sensitized by P01579 /IL-1beta . In conclusion , our data suggest that both p38 MAPK and P35228 are involved in P01579 /IL-1beta-induced sensitization of the thyroid cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis via the activation of caspases 3 , 7 , and 10 and that this pathway may be further activated by P55957 . This hints that inflammatory cytokines regulate death-receptor-mediated apoptosis at multiple points in the process . DB00909 block of cloned human T-type voltage-gated calcium channels . DB00909 ( ZNS ) is a multi-target antiepileptic drug reported to be efficient in the treatment of both partial and generalized seizures , with T-type Ca(2+) channel blockade being one of its proposed mechanisms of action . In this study , we systematically investigated electrophysiological effects of ZNS on cloned human Ca(v)3.1-3.3 Ca(2+) channels in a heterologous P29320 -293 expression system using whole cell patch-clamp technique . Concentration-response studies were performed in the range from 5 microM to 2mM for Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) channels exhibiting a 15.4-30.8 % reduction of Ca(2+) influx within the maximum therapeutic plasma range ( 50-200 microM ZNS ) . The other T-type Ca(2+) channel entities , Ca(v)3.1 and Q9P0X4 , were even less sensitive to ZNS . Both voltage- and concentration-dependence of inactivation kinetics remained unchanged for Ca(v)3.2 VGCC , whereas Ca(v)3.1 and Q9P0X4 exhibited minor , though significant reduction of inactivation-tau . Interestingly , ZNS block of Ca(v)3.2 VGCCs was not use-dependent and remained unaffected by changes in the holding potential . Steady-state inactivation studies did not display a significant shift in steady-state availability of Ca(v)3.2 channels at 100 microM ZNS ( DeltaV(1/2)=3.1mV , p=0.071 ) . Our studies indicate that ZNS is a moderate blocker of human Ca(v)3 T-type Ca(2+) channels with little or no effect on Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) channel inactivation kinetics , use- and state-dependence of blockade . These results suggest that T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibition only partially contributes to the anti-absence activity of ZNS antiepileptic drug . Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT signaling promotes apoptosis of primary effusion lymphoma cells . PURPOSE : Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase ( P19957 '-kinase ) can be activated by the P04264 protein of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus ( KSHV ) . However , the role of P19957 '-kinase in KSHV-associated primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL ) is not known . To assess this , we studied survival and apoptosis in PEL cell lines following inhibition of P19957 '-kinase . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Constitutive activation of several targets of P19957 -kinase and apoptotic proteins were determined by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies . We used LY294002 to block P19957 '-kinase/AKT activation and assess apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis . RESULTS : Blocking P19957 '-kinase induced apoptosis in PEL cells , including BC1 , BC3 , BCBL1 , and HBL6 , whereas BCP1 was refractory to LY294002-induced apoptosis . LY294002-induced apoptosis did not seem to involve Fas/Fas-L but had an additive effect to CH11-mediated apoptosis . We also show that AKT/ P31749 is constitutively activated in all PELs and treatment with LY294002 causes complete dephosphorylation in all cell lines except BCP1 where a residual AKT phosphorylation remained after 24 hours of treatment . Q12778 and GSK3 were also constitutively phosphorylated in PELs and treatment with LY294002 caused their dephosphorylation . Although inhibition of P19957 '-kinase induced cleavage of P55957 in all cell lines , cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria and caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated in LY294002-induced apoptotic BC1 but not in resistant BCP1 . Similarly , P98170 , a target of AKT , was down-regulated after LY294002 treatment only in sensitive PEL cells . CONCLUSIONS : Our data show that the P19957 '-kinase pathway plays a major role in survival of PEL cells and suggest that this cascade may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in primary effusion lymphomas . DB01645 potentiates the P01160 effect on a K(+)-conductance in P29320 -293 cells . P29320 -293 cells are known to reflect many features of the late distal tubule . Furthermore , they have the ability to release urodilatin , the structural analog to P01160 . RT-PCR was performed to test for the expression of natriuretic peptide receptors . While the mRNA for the human P01160 receptor ( P16066 , P16066 ) could be amplified , the P09543 -specific receptor P20594 ( P20594 ) and the receptor specific for guanylins , P25092 , could not be detected . In patch clamp experiments the effects of P01160 ( 10 nM ) on membrane voltage ( V(m) ) were monitored and P29320 -293 cells depolarized by 2.3 +/- 0.5 mV ( n=14 ) . In the presence of the P01133 receptor blocker genistein ( 10 microM ) the effect of P01160 was increased by 65 % to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mV ( n=14 ) . After removal of genistein the P01160 -mediated depolarization further increased by 147 % to 5.7 +/- 1.0 mV ( n=14 ) . P01160 given repetitively without genistein had no increasing depolarizing effect in P29320 -293 cells with time . The P01160 effect could be fully blocked by 1 mM Ba(2+) and by 1 microM of the specific PKG inhibitor KT5823 indicating that P01160 inhibits a K(+)-conductance via a cGMP-dependent protein kinase . DB01645 itself hyperpolarized the membrane voltage of P29320 -293 cells by -3.9 +/- 0.6 mV ( n=11 ) and this effect could also be fully blocked by Ba(2+) ( -0.3 +/- 0.1 mV , n=5 ) , indicating that genistein activates a K(+)-conductance which contributes significantly to the membrane potential of P29320 -293 cells . Synergism between bosutinib ( DB06616 ) and the Chk1 inhibitor ( PF-00477736 ) in highly imatinib-resistant P11274 /ABL⁺ leukemia cells . Interactions between the dual P11274 / P00519 and Src inhibitor bosutinib and the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 were examined in P11274 / P00519 (+) leukemia cells , particularly imatinib-resistant cells , including those with the T315I mutation . Bosutinib blocked PF-00477736-induced P27361 /2 activation and sharply increased apoptosis in association with Mcl-1 inhibition , p34(cdc2) dephosphorylation , BimEL up-regulation , and DNA damage in imatinib-resistant CML or Ph(+) ALL cell lines . Inhibition of Src or Q02750 by shRNA significantly enhanced PF-0047736 lethality . Bosutinib/PF-00477736 co-treatment also potentiated cell death in P28906 (+) CML patient samples , including dasatinib-resistant blast crisis cells exhibiting both T315I and E355G mutations , but was minimally toxic to normal P28906 (+) cells . Finally , combined in vivo treatment significantly suppressed BaF3/T315I tumor growth and prolonged survival in an allogeneic mouse model . Together , these findings suggest that this targeted combination strategy warrants attention in IM-resistant CML or Ph(+) ALL . Prevention of thrombus formation and growth by antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II-dependent thrombin inhibitors : importance of heparin cofactor II . DB01109 ( HEP ) prevents thrombus formation ( TF ) and thrombus growth ( TG ) , by accelerating thrombin ( THR ) inhibition by antithrombin III ( P01008 ) . Recent studies suggest that dermatan sulphate which catalyzes thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II ( HCII ) , can inhibit TF and TG as effectively as HEP . This study compared the antithrombotic effects of HEP and another agent , DB06271 ( SLX ) which catalyzes thrombin inhibition by P01008 and HCII simultaneously . TF was induced in rabbit jugular veins , using the stasis/hypercoagulation model . TG was measured as the accretion of 125I-fibrin onto existing thrombi in rabbit jugular veins . HEP and SLX inhibited TF when given in doses of 10 and 5 anti-thrombin U/kg , respectively . SLX ( 16 anti-thrombin U/kg or 260 micrograms/kg ) was more effective than HEP ( 120 anti-thrombin U/kg or 800 micrograms/kg ) in preventing TG when administered either as a bolus or by continuous infusion . These data suggest that agents which accelerate THR inhibition by both P01008 and HCII simultaneously , can inhibit TF and TG with less systemic anticoagulation than comparable antithrombotic doses of HEP . DB00575 prevents insulin resistance and hypertension in obese dogs . The role that the central sympathetic nervous system plays in the development of obesity hypertension and insulin was evaluated by feeding dogs a high fat diet with or without clonidine treatment . Thirteen adult mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented and randomly assigned to receive either a high fat diet and no clonidine ( n=6 ) or a high fat diet plus clonidine ( n=7 ) , 0.3 mg P55957 . Blood pressure , heart rate , plasma insulin , and electrolytes were measured daily . P01308 resistance was assessed with a multiple-dose euglycemic clamp ( 1 , 2 , and 30 mU. kg-1. min-1 ) before and after 1 , 3 , and 6 weeks of the high fat diet . DB00575 prevented the hypertension , tachycardia , and insulin resistance associated with feeding dogs the high fat diet but did not affect weight gain . The present study suggests that the central sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in the development of both insulin resistance and hypertension associated with feeding dogs a high fat diet . Expression of angiogenesis- and apoptosis-related genes in chorionic villi derived from recurrent pregnancy loss patients . Angiogenesis takes place during embryogenesis , characterized by the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones . This biological process is also found in the female reproductive system , wound healing , and cancer development . Apoptosis , programmed cell death , is a physiological process in development , tissue homeostasis , and disease . Apoptosis is a normal event in several reproductive tissues including human placenta . In these studies , we investigated whether aberrant angiogenesis and apoptosis are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) . We compared the gene expression level for angiogenesis- and apoptosis-related genes in chorionic villi from RPL patients and those from normal controls . Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis revealed that 7 angiogenesis- and 12 apoptosis-related genes were abnormally expressed in chorionic villi from RPL patients . Angiogenesis-related genes that showed aberrant expression level are matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) , integrin , transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , and leptin receptor . Expression levels for these genes , except for leptin receptor , showed less in chorionic villi from RPL patients than those from normal controls . In contrast , higher expression levels of 12 apoptosis-related genes ( caspase 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , Q92934 , Q07812 , P55957 , Fas , and P48023 ) were shown in chorionic villi from RPL patients than those from normal controls . Taken all together , it is likely that the lower expression of angiogenesis-related genes and the excessive expression of apoptosis-related genes are associated with RPL . Salacia oblonga extract increases glucose transporter 4-mediated glucose uptake in Q9BTT4 rat myotubes : role of mangiferin . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : To evaluate if the antidiabetic properties of Salacia oblonga extract are mediated not only by inhibiting intestinal alpha-glycosidases but also by enhancing glucose transport in muscle and adipose cells . METHODS : S. oblonga extract effects on 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake were assayed in muscle Q9BTT4 -myotubes and 3T3-adipocytes . In Q9BTT4 -myotubes , the amount and translocation of glucose transporters were assayed . A fractionation of the extract was carried out to identify the active compounds . Furthermore , we analyzed the phosphorylation status of key components of signaling pathways that are involved in the molecular mechanisms regulating glucose uptake . RESULTS : S. oblonga extract increased 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake by 50 % in Q9BTT4 -myotubes and 3T3-adipocytes . In Q9BTT4 -myotubes , the extract increased up to a 100 % the P14672 content , activating P14672 promoter transcription and its translocation to the plasma membrane . Mangiferin was identified as the bioactive compound . Furthermore , mangiferin effects were concomitant with the phosphorylation of DB00131 -activated protein kinase without the activation of P31749 /Akt . The effect of mangiferin on 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was blocked by GW9662 , an irreversible P37231 antagonist . CONCLUSIONS : S. oblonga extract and mangiferin may exert their antidiabetic effect by increasing P14672 expression and translocation in muscle cells . These effects are probably mediated through two independent pathways that are related to DB00131 -activated protein kinase and P37231 . DB00316 -inhibitable P35354 . Although paracetamol potently reduces pain and fever , its mechanism of action has so far not been satisfactorily explained . It inhibits both P23219 and P35354 weakly in vitro , but reduces prostaglandin synthesis markedly in vivo . In mouse macrophage J774.2 cells , P35354 induced for 48 hr with high concentrations of NSAIDs is more sensitive to inhibition with paracetamol than endotoxin-induced P35354 . In the rat pleurisy model of inflammation , a second peak of P35354 protein appears 48 hr after administration of the inflammatory stimulus , during the resolution phase of the inflammatory process . Inhibition of the activity of this late-appearing P35354 with indomethacin or a selective P35354 inhibitor , delays resolution and the inflammation is prolonged . Cultured lung fibroblasts also express P35354 activity after stimulation with IL-1beta which is highly sensitive to inhibition with paracetamol . Thus , evidence is accumulating for the existence of a P35354 variant or a new P36551 enzyme which can be inhibited with paracetamol . DB01285 releasing hormone ( P06850 ) antagonist attenuates adjuvant induced arthritis : role of P06850 in peripheral inflammation . OBJECTIVE : To determine whether a corticotropin releasing hormone ( P06850 ) type 1-specific receptor antagonist , antalarmin , would alter the progression of inflammation in adjuvant induced arthritis ( AIA ) susceptible LEW/N rats by blocking local P06850 mediated inflammatory responses or render AIA resistant F344/N rats more susceptible to AIA by blocking central P06850 , thus reducing secretion of endogenous glucocorticoids . METHODS : F344/N and LEW/N rats were assigned to either drug or vehicle groups and treated with 20 mg/kg antalarmin or vehicle alone P55957 for 25 days by intraperitoneal injection . Arthritis was induced in both antalarmin and vehicle treated LEW/N and F344/N rats by subcutaneous injections at the base of the tail of incomplete Freund 's adjuvant containing 10 mg/ml heat killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Control F344/N and LEW/N rats were maintained on either antalarmin or vehicle . RESULTS : Chronic blockade of P34998 with systemic antalarmin significantly ameliorated AIA in LEW/N rats , reducing the severity of inflammation in peripheral joints , evidenced by clinical and histopathology scores , and weight loss associated with disease onset . Antalarmin neither induced nor exacerbated arthritis expression in F344/N or LEW/N rats , despite suppression of levels of adjuvant induced corticosterone , the major antiinflammatory glucocorticoid in rats . CONCLUSION : Systemic blockade of P06850 -RI appeared to predominantly block peripheral proinflammatory effects of immune P06850 , rather than the systemic glucocorticoid mediated antiinflammatory effects of hypothalamic P06850 . Results indicate that chronic treatment with a P06850 antagonist attenuates progressive inflammation induced degeneration of synovia , cartilage , and bone in arthritic joints , suggesting that antalarmin may have therapeutic potential in treatment of human autoimmune and inflammatory disorders . P50591 -activated stress kinases suppress apoptosis through transcriptional upregulation of Q8WXI8 -1 . P01375 -related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( P50591 ) is a potentially useful anticancer agent with exquisite selectivity for cancer cells . Unfortunately , many cancers show or acquire resistance to P50591 . In this study we report that P50591 activates a O43318 --> mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) kinase 3 ( P46734 ) / P52564 --> p38 pathway in prostate cancer cells that transcriptionally upregulates expression of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member Q8WXI8 -1 . P50591 alone triggered robust formation of the ' death-inducing signaling complex ' ( DISC ) , activation of the initiator caspase-8 , and truncation of the Q7L3V2 P55957 ( tBID ) . Nevertheless , simultaneous disruption of the p38 MAPK pathway was required to suppress Q8WXI8 -1 expression , thereby allowing tBID to activate the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member Q16611 and stimulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization ( MOMP ) . Release of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis ( IAP ) antagonist , Q9NR28 / Q9NR28 , from the intermembrane space was sufficient to promote P50591 -induced apoptosis , whereas release of cytochrome c and activation of the apoptosome was dispensable . Even after MOMP , however , mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) activated a secondary signaling pathway , involving c-Jun N-terminal kinases ( JNKs ) , that similarly upregulated Q8WXI8 -1 expression and partially rescued some cells from death . Thus , stress kinases activated at distinct steps , before and after mitochondrial injury , mediate P50591 resistance through maintenance of Q8WXI8 -1 expression . Hepatocellular apoptosis in mice is associated with early upregulation of mitochondrial glucose metabolism . Hepatocyte death due to apoptosis is a hallmark of almost every liver disease . Manipulation of cell death regulatory steps during the apoptotic process is therefore an obvious goal of biomedical research . To clarify whether metabolic changes occur prior to the characteristic apoptotic events , we used ex vivo multinuclear NMR-spectroscopy to study metabolic pathways of [U-(13)C]glucose in mouse liver during Fas-induced apoptosis . We addressed whether these changes could be associated with protection against apoptosis afforded by Epidermal Growth Factor ( P01133 ) . Our results show that serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels , caspase-3 activity , P55957 cleavage and changes in cellular energy stores were not observed before 3 h following anti-Fas injection . However , as early as 45 min after anti-Fas treatment , we observed upregulation of carbon entry ( i.e. flux ) from glucose into the Krebs-cycle via pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) and pyruvate carboxylase ( PC ) ( up to 139 % and 123 % of controls , respectively , P < 0.001 ) . This was associated with increased glutathione synthesis . P01133 treatment significantly attenuated Fas-induced apoptosis , liver injury and the late decrease in energy stores , as well as the early fluxes through PDH and PC which were comparable to untreated controls . Using ex vivo multinuclear NMR-spectroscopic analysis , we have shown that Fas receptor activation in mouse liver time-dependently affects specific metabolic pathways of glucose . These early upregulations in glucose metabolic pathways occur prior to any visible signs of apoptosis and may have the potential to contribute to the initiation of apoptosis by maintaining mitochondrial energy production and cellular glutathione stores .
Polymorphisms of human histamine receptor H4 gene are associated with breast cancer in Chinese Han population . Previous investigations indicated that histamine receptor H4 ( Q9H3N8 ) played important roles in many aspects of breast cancer pathogenesis , and that the polymorphisms of Q9H3N8 gene may result in expression and functional changes of Q9H3N8 proteins . However , the relationship between polymorphisms of Q9H3N8 and breast cancer risk and malignant degree is unclear . In the present study , we conducted a case-control investigation among 185 Chinese Han breast cancer patients and 199 ethnicity-matched health controls . Four tag-SNPs ( i.e. rs623590 , rs16940762 , rs11662595 and rs1421125 ) of Q9H3N8 were genotyped and association analysis was performed . Odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were used to assess the association . We found that the T allele of rs623590 had a decreased risk of breast cancer ( adjusted OR , 0.667 ; 95 % CI , 0.486-0.913 ; P=0.012 ) while the A allele of rs1421125 had an increased risk ( adjusted OR , 1.653 ; 95 % CI , 1.139-2.397 ; P=0.008 ) . Further haplotype analysis showed that the CAA haplotype of rs623590-rs11662595-rs1421125 was more frequent among patients with breast cancer ( adjusted OR , 1.856 ; 95 % CI , 1.236-2.787 ; P=0.003 ) . Additionally , polymorphisms of rs623590 and rs11662595 were also correlated with clinical stages , lymph node involvement , and P04626 status . These findings indicated that the variants of rs623590 , rs11662595 and rs1421125 genotypes of Q9H3N8 gene were significantly associated with the risk and malignant degree of breast cancer in Chinese Han populations , which may provide us novel insight into the pathogenesis of breast cancer although further studies with larger participants worldwide are still needed for conclusion validation . Synthetic delivery system for tuberculosis vaccines : immunological evaluation of the M. tuberculosis 38 kDa protein entrapped in biodegradable P00747 microparticles . Tuberculosis remains a major public health burden which could be ameliorated by effective and well-defined subunit vaccines , particularly because the protective efficacy of current M. bovis BCG vaccines is both unpredictable and variable . The immunodominant 38 kDa antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was entrapped in biodegradable poly ( DL-lactide co-glycolide ) ( P00747 ) microparticles which served as a delivery system . Both cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed and compared with those obtained after immunization with the 38 kDa protein emulsified in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ( IFA ) . Vaccination of mice with a single dose of antigen-loaded microparticles resulted in specific IgG titres peaking after five weeks comparable to those achieved after vaccination with protein emulsified in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ( IFA ) . T-cell responses were found to be superior to those induced with antigen/IFA . The T- and B-cell epitope specificities ad judged with synthetic peptides were identical following immunization with antigen in microparticles or IFA . Differences in adjuvanticity were revealed by measuring antigen-specific IgG1 , IgG2a and antigen-induced P01579 secretion in vitro : substantially higher titres of IgG2a were observed following immunization with antigen/microparticles than with 38 kDa protein/IFA . This was paralleled by a tenfold higher secretion of P01579 in mice injected with antigen/microparticles . Reduction in colony-forming units was not consistent in mice immunized with 38 kDa protein entrapped in microparticles which were subsequently infected with live tubercle bacilli . Taken together these results indicate that biodegradable P00747 microparticles constitute a favorable candidate vaccine delivery system worthy of further assessment in the quest to develop better and defined agents protecting against tuberculosis . Chronic daily tadalafil prevents the corporal fibrosis and veno-occlusive dysfunction that occurs after cavernosal nerve resection . OBJECTIVES : To determine whether a long-term single daily oral dose of a longer half-life phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) inhibitor , tadalafil , has a similar effect to that of the shorter half-life O76074 inhibitors sildenafil and vardenafil , and can prevent the fibrosis and resultant corporal veno-occlusive dysfunction ( CVOD ) occurring after cavernosal nerve ( CN ) injury . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Male rats ( 10 per group ) had either a sham operation , unilateral CN resection ( P21554 ) or bilateral P21554 , and were left untreated or given retrolingually 5 mg/kg per day of tadalafil . After 45 days , CVOD was assessed via cavernosometry , and the underlying corporal tissue changes were examined by immunohistochemistry and histochemistry ( followed by quantitative image analysis ) , Western blots , and ad hoc methods . RESULTS : DB00820 treatment normalized the low response to papaverine and high drop rate in the intracavernosal pressure measured by cavernosometry after P21554 compared with sham-operated rats . DB00820 also normalized the increase in penile shaft collagen content , and the reduction in corporal smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) content , SMC/collagen , and replication index , and improved the lower collagen III/I ratio and the increase in apoptotic index , caused by P21554 , compared with sham operation . There were no effects of tadalafil on increased transforming growth factor beta1 , inducible nitric oxide synthase and xanthine oxidoreductase levels . CONCLUSIONS : A long-term single daily dose of tadalafil prevented CVOD and the underlying corporal fibrosis in the rat caused by CN damage , as effectively as the previously reported continuous treatment with vardenafil or sildenafil , through a cGMP-related mechanism that appears to be independent of inducible nitric oxide synthase induction . [ Effects of plasminogen and streptokinase on the vital functions of nervous tissue cells in culture ] . In the protein-deficient media plasminogen stimulated the vital functions of cells and in concentrations 10(-7)-10(-10) M it protected cells of sympathetic ganglia , neocortex and continues cell lines under damaging actions of H2O2 ( 0.0001 M ) , NH4CI ( 0.01 M ) and cooling . DB00086 essentially influenced the mode of damaging effect of DB00171 ( 0.001 M ) . Even a short-term exposition ( 20 min ) of PC12 cells with both proteins ( each in the concentration 10(-9) M ) led to sharp alterations in intracellular DB00171 - or Ca(2+)-activated proteolysis . In some cases plasminogen and streptokinase provided acceleration of cultured tissue maturation , improvement of cell adhesion , high survival rate , the increase in quantity and length of processes and their arborisation . Electronic microscopy established the character of structural rearrangements of nervous tissue cells ( neurons , astrocytes , oligodendrocytes ) , reflecting the protective action of plasminogen and streptokinase . In the presence of plasminogen and especially streptokinase , the total number of cultured glioma P13671 and neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells , the intracellular contents of protein , RNA and DNA increased several-fold . Addition of plasminogen promoted formation of processes by neuroblastoma cells , this suggests initiation of differentiation of cellular elements . In cultures of sensitive and sympathetic ganglia streptokinase increased proliferation of Schwann cells . These proteins did not cause transformation of PC12 enterochromaffine cells to neurons , though plasminogen facilitated it . P00747 addition to cell cultures did not increase fibrinolytic activity of the culture medium in the culture medium , and streptokinase did not lose its plasminogen-activating capacity . Maximizing clinical benefit with trastuzumab . To optimize patient management in breast cancer a number of factors are considered , including hormone receptor and P04626 status . A feasible approach for women with less aggressive , estrogen receptor/ P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer is to consider trastuzumab ( Herceptin ; F. Hoffmann-La Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) combined with endocrine therapy . Randomized clinical trials are ongoing to assess the combination of trastuzumab with aromatase inhibitors . In patients with aggressive P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer , trastuzumab/chemotherapy combination regimens are warranted . When administered first line in combination with a taxane , trastuzumab improves all clinical outcome parameters , including survival , in such patients . DB00072 adds little to the toxicity profile of taxanes , and trastuzumab combination therapy is associated with improvements in quality of life when compared with chemotherapy alone . There is encouraging evidence of improved efficacy when trastuzumab is combined with other cytotoxic agents with proven single-agent activity in breast cancer , including capecitabine ( DB01101 ; F. Hoffmann-La Roche ) , gemcitabine , and vinorelbine . DB00072 is also being investigated as part of triplet drug regimens . DB00072 has good single-agent activity in first-line therapy . This is of relevance to women with P04626 -positive disease who are not suitable for , or do not wish to receive , cytotoxic chemotherapy . The benefits noted with trastuzumab-containing regimens were documented in clinical trials where trastuzumab was given until disease progression . A further rationale exists to continue trastuzumab beyond progression . Data from retrospective reviews indicate that this strategy is feasible . Dynamic genetic linkage of intermediate blood pressure phenotypes during postural adaptations in a founder population . Blood pressure ( BP ) is a dynamic phenotype that varies rapidly to adjust to changing environmental conditions . Standing upright is a recent evolutionary trait , and genetic factors that influence postural adaptations may contribute to BP variability . We studied the effect of posture on the genetics of BP and intermediate BP phenotypes . We included 384 sib-pairs in 64 sib-ships from families ascertained by early-onset hypertension and dyslipidemia . Blood pressure , three hemodynamic and seven neuroendocrine intermediate BP phenotypes were measured with subjects lying supine and standing upright . The effect of posture on estimates of heritability and genetic covariance was investigated in full pedigrees . Linkage was conducted on 196 candidate genes by sib-pair analyses , and empirical estimates of significance were obtained . A permutation algorithm was implemented to study the postural effect on linkage . ADRA1A , APO , CAST , Q9Y5Q5 , P34998 , P24530 , P09038 , GC , P17302 , Q92953 , P08254 , P01303 , P08235 , P26678 , P37173 , P25445 , and P34981 showed evidence of linkage with any phenotype in the supine position and not upon standing , whereas P15121 , P16671 , P25101 , P12259 , P14780 , PKD2 , P27169 , P37231 , Q9UBK2 , P17252 , and P07949 were specifically linked to standing phenotypes . Genetic profiling was undertaken to show genetic interactions among intermediate BP phenotypes and genes specific to each posture . When investigators perform genetic studies exclusively on a single posture , important genetic components of BP are missed . Supine and standing BPs have distinct genetic signatures . Standardized maneuvers influence the results of genetic investigations into BP , thus reflecting its dynamic regulation . DB00472 induces preventive and complex effects against colon cancer development in epithelial and stromal areas in rats . DB00472 ( FLX ) is a drug commonly used as antidepressant . However , its effects on tumorigenesis remain controversial . Aiming to evaluate the effects of FLX treatment on early malignant changes , we analyzed serotonin ( 5-HT ) metabolism and recognition , aberrant crypt foci ( Q9NQ94 ) , proliferative process , microvessels , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression in colon tissue . Male Wistar rats received a daily FLX-gavage ( 30mgkg(-1) ) and , a single dose of 1,2 dimethylhydrazine ( Q03001 ; i.p. , 125mgkg(-1) ) . After 6 weeks of FLX-treatment , our results revealed that FLX and nor-fluoxetine ( N-FLX ) are present in colon tissue , which was related to significant increase in serotonin ( 5-HT ) levels ( P < 0.05 ) possibly through a blockade in P31645 mRNA ( serotonin reuptake transporter ; P < 0.05 ) resulting in lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-HIAA ) levels ( P < 0.01 ) and , P28335 receptor mRNA expressions . FLX-treatment decreased dysplastic Q9NQ94 development ( P < 0.01 ) and proliferative process ( P < 0.001 ) in epithelia . We observed a significant decrease in the development of malignant microvessels ( P < 0.05 ) , P15692 ( P < 0.001 ) , and P35354 expression ( P < 0.01 ) . These findings suggest that FLX may have oncostatic effects on carcinogenic colon tissue , probably due to its modulatory activity on 5-HT metabolism and/or its ability to reduce colonic malignant events . P62158 and troponin C : affinity chromatographic study of divalent cation requirements for troponin I inhibitory peptide ( residues 104-115 ) , mastoparan and fluphenazine binding . The different conformations induced by the binding of Mg2+ or Ca2+ to troponin C ( TnC ) and calmodulin ( P62158 ) results in the exposure of various interfaces with potential to bind target compounds . The interaction of TnC or P62158 with three affinity columns with ligands of either the synthetic peptide of troponin I ( TnI ) inhibitory region ( residues 104-115 ) , mastoparan ( a wasp venom peptide ) , or fluphenazine ( a phenothiazine drug ) were investigated in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ . TnC and P62158 in the presence of either Ca2+ or Mg2+ bound to the TnI peptide 104-115 . The cation specificity for this interaction firmly establishes that the TnI inhibitory region binds to the high affinity sites of TnC ( most likely the N-terminal helix of site III ) and presumably the homologous region of P62158 . Mastoparan interacted strongly with both proteins in the presence of Ca2+ but , in the presence of Mg2+ , did not bind to TnC and only bound weakly to P62158 . DB00623 bound to TnC and P62158 only in the presence of Ca2+ . When the ligands interacted with either proteins there was an increase in cation affinity , such that TnC and P62158 were eluted from the TnI peptide or mastoparan affinity column with 0.1 M DB00974 compared with the 0.01 M DB00974 required to elute the proteins from the fluphenazine column . The interaction of these ligands with their receptor sites on TnC and P62158 require a specific and spatially correct alignment of hydrophobic and negatively charged residues on these proteins. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Retinoblastoma and the related pocket protein P28749 act as coactivators of Q13562 to enhance gene transcription . Gene inactivation studies have suggested that the product of the retinoblastoma gene , P06400 , is particularly limiting in pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) -expressing cell lineages . Indeed , in P06400 knock-out mice , these cells develop tumors with high frequency . To understand the implication of limiting P06400 expression in these cells , we investigated the action of P06400 and its related pocket proteins , P28749 and Q08999 , on P01189 gene transcription . This led to the identification of the neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor , Q13562 , as a target of P06400 action . P06400 and to a lesser extent P28749 , but not Q08999 , enhance Q13562 -dependent transcription , and this activity appears to depend on direct protein interactions between the P06400 pocket and the helix-loop-helix domain of Q13562 . In vivo , Q13562 is found in a complex that includes P06400 and also the orphan nuclear receptor NGFI-B , which mediates corticotropin-releasing hormone activation of P01189 transcription . The formation of a similar complex in vitro requires the presence of P06400 as a bridge between Q13562 and NGFI-B . In P01189 -expressing AtT-20 cells , P06400 and P28749 are present on the P01189 promoter and inhibition of their expression through small interfering RNA decreases P01189 mRNA levels . The action of P06400 and its related proteins on P01189 transcription may contribute to the establishment and/or maintenance of the differentiation phenotype . Gender difference in the activity but not expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in human lung adenocarcinoma cells . The higher frequency of lung adenocarcinoma in women smokers than in men smokers suggests a role for gender-dependent factors in the etiology of lung cancer . We evaluated estrogen receptor ( ER ) alpha and beta expression and activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and normal lung fibroblasts . Q8N1N2 -length ERalpha and ERbeta proteins were expressed in all cell lines with higher ERbeta than ERalpha . Although estradiol ( E(2) ) binding was similar , E(2) stimulated proliferation only in cells from females , and this response was inhibited by anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( DB04468 ) and DB00947 . In contrast , E(2) did not stimulate replication of lung adenocarcinoma cells from males and DB04468 or ICI did not block cell proliferation . Similarly , transcription of an estrogen response element-driven reporter gene was stimulated by E(2) in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females , but not males . P06401 ( PR ) expression was increased by E(2) in two out of five adenocarcinoma cell lines from females , but none from males . E(2) decreased P12830 protein expression in some of the cell lines from females , as it did in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , but not in the cell lines from males . Thus , ERalpha and ERbeta expression does not correlate with the effect of ER ligands on cellular activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells . On the other hand , coactivator Q15648 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females versus males and higher in adenocarcinoma cells than in normal human bronchial epithelial cells . Q15648 and other ER coregulators may contribute to differences in estrogen responsiveness between lung adenocarcinoma cells in females and males . Central neuropeptide Y enhances bile secretion through vagal and muscarinic but not nitric oxide pathways in rats . Neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) acts in the central nervous system to regulate gastrointestinal functions in rats and dogs . The effects of intracisternal injection of P01303 on bile secretion and biliary components were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats with bile duct cannula . Intracisternal P01303 ( 0.02-0.12 nmol ) dose-dependently increased bile secretion by 9. P98173 .5 % . The secretory response occurred within the first 20-40 min and lasted for the 120-min observation period . Intravenous injection of P01303 ( 0.12 nmol ) did not modify bile secretion under identical conditions . Biliary bile acid , phospholipid , and cholesterol secretion were not modified by intracisternal injection of P01303 ( 0.12 nmol ) , whereas bicarbonate was increased by 19.0 +/- 1.7 % from 40 to 120 min after P01303 injection . Cervical cord transection at the P13671 level , acute bilateral adrenalectomy ( -120 min ) , or injection of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( 10 mg/kg , IV , -15 min ) , an inhibitor of nitric oxide biosynthesis , did not alter intracisternal P01303 ( 0.12 nmol ) -induced stimulation of bile secretion . Atropine ( 2.0 mg/kg , IP , -30 min ) and bilateral cervical vagotomy ( -120 min ) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of intracisternal P01303 ( 0.12 nmol ) on bile secretion . These findings indicate that P01303 acts in the brain to stimulate bicarbonate-dependent bile secretion through vagal and muscarinic pathways and suggest that peptides in the central nervous system may be involved in the vagal regulation of bile secretion . DB06698 treatment in managing vertigo and improving vestibular compensation : clarification . DB06698 dihydrochloride ( betahistine ) is currently used in the management of vertigo and vestibular pathologies with different aetiologies . The main goal of this review is to clarify the mechanisms of action of this drug , responsible for the symptomatic relief of vertigo and the improvement of vestibular compensation . The review starts with a brief summary recalling the role of histamine as a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter in the control of the vestibular functions , and the role of the histaminergic system in vestibular compensation . Then are presented data recorded in animal models demonstrating that betahistine efficacy can be explained by mechanisms targeting the histamine receptors ( HRs ) at three different levels : the vascular tree , with an increase of cochlear and vestibular blood flow involving the P35367 ; the central nervous system , with an increase of histamine turnover implicating the Q9Y5N1 , and the peripheral labyrinth , with a decrease of vestibular input implying the Q9Y5N1 / Q9H3N8 . Clinical data from vestibular loss patients show the impact of betahistine treatment for the long-term control of vertigo , improvement of balance and quality of life that can be explained by these mechanisms of action . However , two conditions , at least , are required for reaching the betahistine therapeutic effect : the dose and the duration of treatment . Experimental and clinical data supporting these requirements are exposed in the last part of this review . Successful thrombolysis of a stroke with a pulmonary embolism in a young woman . BACKGROUND : Paradoxical embolism is a rare event , accounting for < 2 % of all arterial emboli . The diagnosis is often difficult , and consequences for the patient can be severe . CASE REPORT : We describe the case of a 35-year-old female physician who presented to our Emergency Department ( ED ) in severe hemodynamic compromise , with an altered level of consciousness and major expressive aphasia 1 day after undergoing a leg varicosal stripping procedure under regional anesthesia . She was successfully thrombolyzed with 0.9 mg/kg of Recombinant Tissue P00747 Activator ( rtPA , DB00009 ) and had a full recovery . CONCLUSION : To our knowledge , this is the first description of a case of massive pulmonary embolism associated with a paradoxical stroke related to patent foramen ovale that was thrombolyzed for both conditions with a " neurological dose " of rtPA . Although thrombolysis was completely successful in this case , indications and contraindications should be thoroughly respected . A more conservative approach with anticoagulation , or a more aggressive approach with surgical thrombectomy , can each potentially have a place in particular cases . Intra-arterial catheter-directed thrombolysis and percutaneous embolectomy are additional options to be considered when available , especially if there are contraindications for systemic thrombolysis . DB05039 inhibits tumor cell invasiveness and P14780 expression by suppressing IKK/NF-κB activation . The β2 adrenergic receptor ( P07550 ) is a G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor expressed in the human respiratory tract and widely recognized as a pharmacological target for treatments of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( P48444 ) . Although a number of P07550 agonists have been developed for use in asthma therapy , indacaterol is the only ultra-long-acting inhaled β2-agonist ( LABA ) approved by the FDA for relieving the symptoms in P48444 patients . The precise molecular mechanism underlying the pharmacological effect of indacaterol , however , remains unclear . Here , we show that β-arrestin-2 mediates the internalization of P07550 following indacaterol treatment . Moreover , we demonstrate that indacaterol significantly inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) -induced NF-κB activity by reducing levels of both phosphorylated-IKK and -IκBα , thereby decreasing NF-κB nuclear translocation and the expression of P14780 , an NF-κB target gene . Subsequently , we show that indacaterol significantly inhibits P01375 -α/NF-κB-induced cell invasiveness and migration in a human cancer cell line . In conclusion , we propose that indacaterol may inhibit NF-κB activity in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner , preventing further lung damage and improving lung function in P48444 patients . Stimulation of epithelial repair is a likely mechanism for the action of mifepristone in reducing duration of bleeding in users of progestogen-only contraceptives . Many women using progestogen ( P ) -only contraceptives experience uterine bleeding problems . In clinical trials , a single low dose of mifepristone , given to DB00294 users at the beginning of a bleeding episode reduced the number of bleeding days by approximately 50 % compared with controls . In this study , a single dose of mifepristone was administered to etonogestrel ( P17813 ) -exposed pseudo-pregnant mice , 5 days after artificial decidualization was induced when the endometrium showed signs of bleeding . Control mice received vehicle alone . Mice were culled 12- , 18- , 24- and 48-h post-treatment . In the continued presence of P17813 , a single dose of mifepristone stimulated tissue breakdown followed by very rapid repair : most treated tissues were fully restored to the pre-decidualized state by 48 h post-treatment . During repair , proliferating cells ( Ki67 immunostained ) were localized to a band of cells around the basal area in breaking down tissues and to the repairing luminal epithelium and glands . P06401 -positive cells were largely localized to the basal area of the breaking down tissue in treated mice compared with decidual cells in controls . Oestrogen receptor-positive cells were observed in the repairing luminal epithelium and glands compared with the decidua and the basal region in control tissues . It is concluded that mifepristone treatment stimulates rapid restoration of luminal epithelial integrity : such action may be a key event in reducing the number of bleeding days observed in women using DB00294 who were treated with a single dose of mifepristone . Reduced levels of P12830 correlate with progression of corticotroph pituitary tumours . OBJECTIVES : Loss of P12830 is an important marker of epithelial tumour progression . The aims of this study were to explore whether P12830 expression and localization correlate to corticotroph tumour progression , relate the expression of the P12830 gene ( CDH1 ) to immunohistochemical P12830 staining pattern , and study whether the P12830 levels were correlated to methylation status of the CDH1 promoter region . DESIGN : Immunohistochemical analyses of P12830 protein were performed , as was RT-qPCR of the CDH1 and the P01189 genes . Methylation pattern of the promoter region of CDH1 was measured using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA . PATIENTS : Forty-five patients operated at a tertiary referral centre in Oslo , Norway . Adenoma tissue sections and RNA samples from patients with verified Cushing 's disease or Nelson 's syndrome were collected . MEASUREMENTS : Expression of P12830 mRNA and protein in pituitary corticotroph adenomas and average percentage of methylated cytosines in a cytosine-phosphate-guanosine island of the CDH1 promoter . RESULTS : Correlations were observed between tumour progression and both nuclear expression of P12830 and reduced CDH1 mRNA . The P12830 expression was not determined by the methylation pattern of the CDH1 promoter . CONCLUSIONS : Corticotroph tumour progression was associated with reduced expression of the epithelial marker P12830 . Sex steroid receptors , secondary bile acids and colorectal cancer . A possible mechanism of interaction . AIM : The aim of the work was to study in colon-rectum cancer mucosae the binding charateristics , as sex steroid receptors . METHODS : Specific androgen ( AR ) , estrogen ( ER ) and progesterone ( PgR ) receptors were measured in the tissue samples of 35 patients ( 15 males , 20 females ) undergoing colectomy or coloproctectomy for adenocarcinoma . The characteristics of androgen receptor ( AR , DB02901 -R : dihydrotestosterone receptor ) were also investigated using competitive activity of cyproterone acetate , cortisol , aldosterone and steroid-like substances such as deoxycholic and lithocholic acid , present in the milieu of the considered organ . Binding assays and competition tests were conducted using a charcoal dextran method . RESULTS : When present ( 50 % ) , ER and PgR receptors showed very low levels and no difference was noted between cancerous and the surrounding healthy mucosa . AR were found in all samples from both neoplastic and non neoplastic surrounding mucosa , with no significant difference . P10275 however exhibited an altered binding activity in cancer specimens . DB04839 did not displace DB02901 from AR while significant displacing activity was elicited by DB02901 , testosterone , as well as by lithocholic acid , but not by deoxycholic acid . CONCLUSION : In cancerous large bowel mucosa , androgen receptors show altered binding characteristics . The selective binding of lithocholic acid to AR supports the hypothesis that diet-related endoluminal substances may play a role in cancer development model where molecular alterations such as DNA damage or mutation is the 1st event . Neuropeptide Y induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via calcineurin signaling in rats . Neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) has been shown to participate in cardiac hypertrophy . However , the mechanisms by which P01303 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy are poorly understood . This study tested the hypothesis that P01303 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent calcineurin ( CaN ) pathway in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes . After 24-h treatment , P01303 ( 100 nM ) significantly increased 3H-leucine incorporation and c-Jun mRNA expression , concomitant with augment of CaN activity and protein level in cardiomyocytes compared to those cells without P01303 treatment . The enhancement of 3H-leucine incorporation and c-Jun mRNA expression in cardiomyocytes treated with P01303 were markedly inhibited by cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) , a selective inhibitor of CaN . We also investigated the effect of P01303 on intracellular Ca2+ level in cardiomyocytes . There were no obvious changes in intracellular Ca2+ level of cytoplasm and nucleus in cardiomyocytes treated with P01303 ( 100 nM ) for 10 min . However , P01303 significantly increased intracellular Ca2+ level of cytoplasm and nucleus in cardiomyocytes after 24-h treatment . The result suggested that P01303 could induce hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes via Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent CaN signal pathway . The enhancement of [Ca2+]i caused by P01303 may activate CaN signal pathways to mediate cardiac hypertrophy . Regulation of Con A-dependent cytokine production from P01730 + and CD8+ T lymphocytes by autosecretion of histamine . OBJECTIVES : Previously we have shown that both P01730 + T cells and CD8+ T cells produce histamine when activated with Con A . The aim of this study was to examine whether cytokine production by these cells is regulated by autosecretion of histamine . MATERIALS : P01730 + and CD8+ T cells were separated from spleen cells of C57BL/6 mice and mice lacking the H1 receptor ( P35367 ) or P25021 , using anti- P01730 +- and anti-CD8+-coupled magnetic beads , respectively . RESULTS : Depletion of the P35367 resulted in decreases in the release of P60568 and P22301 from both P01730 + and CD8+ cells and increases in the release of P05112 from P01730 + T cells and P01579 from CD8+ cells . Mice lacking the P25021 showed up-regulation of P01579 secretion from CD8+ cells and of P05112 from P01730 + and CD8+ T cells . Release of P60568 and P22301 from P01730 + as well as CD8+ cells was down-regulated in these mice . Both P01730 + and CD8+ T cell fractions synthesized histamine , which was enhanced in the P35367 -deficient CD8+ T cells . Treatment of the cells with alpha-fluoromethyl-histidine , a specific inhibitor of HDC , or histaminase increased P01579 from CD8+ cells , whereas it had no appreciable effect on P05112 secretion from P01730 + cells . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that cytokine production by P01730 + and CD8+ T lymphocytes is regulated by autosecretion of histamine . Fluvoxamine exerts anorexic effect in P28335 receptor mutant mice with heterozygous mutation of beta-endorphin gene . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-HT ) 2C receptors and the downstream melanocortin pathway are suggested to mediate the anorexic effects of m-chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP ) and fenfluramine . We previously reported that fluvoxamine , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , together with pharmacological inactivation of P28335 receptors exert feeding suppression through activation of P28222 receptors in mice . Here , we report that fluvoxamine exerted anorexic effects in P28335 receptor mutant mice with heterozygous mutation of beta-endorphin gene ( 2CREnd mice ) , whereas fluvoxamine had no effect on food intake in age-matched wild-type mice and P28335 receptor mutant mice , which are associated with decreases in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) expression . mCPP suppressed food intake in P28335 receptor mutant mice , 2CREnd mice and age-matched wild-type mice . These results suggest that fluvoxamine-induced feeding suppression requires a perturbation of P28335 receptor and beta-endorphin signalling plus functional hypothalamic P01189 activity , whereas mCPP-induced feeding suppression does not always require functional P28335 receptor , beta-endorphin , and P01189 activity in mice . DB06698 ameliorates olanzapine-induced weight gain through modulation of histaminergic , P01303 and AMPK pathways . Olanzapine is widely used to treat schizophrenia and other disorders , but causes adverse obesity and other metabolic side-effects . Both animal and clinical studies have shown that co-treatment with betahistine ( a histaminergic H1 receptor agonist and H3 receptor antagonist ) is effective for ameliorating olanzapine-induced weight gain/obesity . To reveal the mechanisms underlying these effects , this study investigated the effects of co-treatment of olanzapine and betahistine ( O+B ) on expressions of histaminergic H1 receptor ( P35367 ) , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) , and proopiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) in the hypothalamus associated with reducing olanzapine-induced weight gain . Olanzapine significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of P35367 , while O+B co-treatment significantly downregulated the P35367 levels , compared to the olanzapine-only treatment group . The P01303 mRNA expression was significantly enhanced by olanzapine , but it was significantly reversed by O+B co-treatment . The hypothalamic P35367 expression was positively correlated with total food intake , and P01303 expression . Olanzapine also increased AMPKα activation measured by the AMPKα phosphorylation ( pAMPKα ) /AMPKα ratio compared with controls , whereas O+B co-treatment decreased the pAMPKα/AMPKα ratio , compared with olanzapine only treatment . The pAMPKα/AMPKα ratio was positively correlated with total food intake and P35367 expression . Although olanzapine administration decreased the P01189 mRNA level , this level was not affected by O+B co-treatment . Therefore , these results suggested that co-treatment with betahistine may reverse olanzapine-induced body weight gain via the P35367 - P01303 and P35367 -pAMPKα pathways . The role of tumor suppressor dysregulation in prostate cancer progression . P10275 activity is essential for prostate cancer development and progression . While there are classically defined roles for the retinoblastoma ( P06400 ) and p53 tumor suppressor pathways in maintenance of cell cycle control and the DNA damage response , recent studies have demonstrated a direct role of these two pathways in regulating AR expression and function . While the role of Pten deregulation in prostate cancer has provided much insight in to the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer initiation and progression , emerging roles for P06400 and p53 are likely to further expand upon our understanding of tumor suppressor/nuclear receptor interaction . As disconnecting mitogenic signaling from AR-mediated gene transcription underlies the progression to castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , functional inactivation of these two tumor suppressor pathways represents one mechanism through which AR protein levels can be upregulated and AR-mediated gene transcription can become aberrant . Importantly , recent advances in small molecule inhibitor design and discovery have led to the identification of agents capable of targeting these two prominent pathways and restoring the function of deregulated wild-type P06400 and p53 protein . While such agents have undergone extensive study in many solid tumor types , the additional importance of P06400 and p53 in restraining transcription of the AR gene within the prostate provides impetus for examining how loss of these two tumor suppressor proteins can facilitate transition of prostate cancers to CRPC . As will be reviewed in this article , restoration of P06400 and p53 functions are not only important in regard to shortterm cell cycle regulation and response to genomic stresses , but likely have direct implications for deregulation of the AR locus . Pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence : target symptoms and target mechanisms . Alcoholism is a major public health problem and resembles , in many ways , other chronic relapsing medical conditions . At least 2 separate dimensions of its symptomatology offer targetable pathophysiological mechanisms . Systems that mediate positive reinforcement by alcohol are likely important targets in early stages of the disease , particularly in genetically susceptible individuals . In contrast , long term neuroadaptive changes caused by chronic alcohol use primarily appear to affect systems mediating negative affective states , and gain importance following a prolonged history of dependence . Feasibility of pharmacological treatment in alcoholism has been demonstrated by a first wave of drugs which consists of 3 currently approved medications , the aldehyde dehydrogenase blocker disulfiram , the opioid antagonist naltrexone ( NTX ) and the functional glutamate antagonist acamprosate ( ACM ) . The treatment toolkit is likely to be expanded in the near future . This will improve overall efficacy and allow individualized treatment , ultimately taking in account the patient 's genetic makeup . In a second wave , early human efficacy data are available for the 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron , the GABA-B agonist baclofen and the anticonvulsant topiramate . The third wave is comprised of compounds predicted to be effective based on a battery of animal models . Using such models , a short list of additional targets has accumulated sufficient preclinical validation to merit clinical development . These include the cannabinoid P21554 receptor , receptors modulating glutamatergic transmission ( Q14416 , 3 and 5 ) , and receptors for stress-related neuropeptides corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF ) , neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) and nociceptin . Once novel treatments are developed , the field faces a major challenge to assure their delivery to patients .
Target genes discovery through copy number alteration analysis in human hepatocellular carcinoma . High-throughput short-read sequencing of exomes and whole cancer genomes in multiple human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cohorts confirmed previously identified frequently mutated somatic genes , such as P04637 , P35222 and O15169 , and identified several novel genes with moderate mutation frequencies , including O14497 , Q68CP9 , Q03164 , MLL2 , Q8NEZ4 , MLL4 , P14316 , Q13315 , CDKN2A , O95750 , P42336 , P51812 , P23458 , Q14145 , Q16236 , Q7Z3J2 , LEPR , P15153 , and P40189 . Functional classification of these mutated genes suggested that alterations in pathways participating in chromatin remodeling , Wnt/β-catenin signaling , JAK/ P35610 signaling , and oxidative stress play critical roles in HCC tumorigenesis . Nevertheless , because there are few druggable genes used in HCC therapy , the identification of new therapeutic targets through integrated genomic approaches remains an important task . Because a large amount of HCC genomic data genotyped by high density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is deposited in the public domain , copy number alteration ( Q08209 ) analyses of these arrays is a cost-effective way to reveal target genes through profiling of recurrent and overlapping amplicons , homozygous deletions and potentially unbalanced chromosomal translocations accumulated during HCC progression . Moreover , integration of CNAs with other high-throughput genomic data , such as aberrantly coding transcriptomes and non-coding gene expression in human HCC tissues and rodent HCC models , provides lines of evidence that can be used to facilitate the identification of novel HCC target genes with the potential of improving the survival of HCC patients . beta-Carotene induces apoptosis and up-regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression and reactive oxygen species production in MCF-7 cancer cells . Although the pharmacological role of beta-carotene in the prevention and treatment of many cancer cells has received increasing attention , the molecular mechanisms underlying such chemopreventive activity are not clear . Since peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( P37231 ) has been implicated in regulating breast cancer cell differentiation and apoptosis , the effects of beta-carotene on the P37231 -mediated pathway and its association with reactive oxygen species production in MCF-7 cells were investigated in the present study . The results demonstrated that beta-carotene significantly increased P37231 mRNA and protein levels in time-dependent manner . In addition , beta-carotene increased the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) expression and decreased the prostanoid synthesis rate-limiting enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 expression . DB07863 ( GW9662 ) , an irreversible P37231 antagonist , partly attenuated the cell death caused by beta-carotene . Further , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production was induced by beta-carotene , resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome C release . DB00143 ( DB00143 ) treatment decreases the intracellular ROS and prevents cytochrome C release and cell apoptosis induced by beta-carotene . In total , these observations suggest that the synergistic effect of P37231 expression and ROS production may account for beta-carotene-mediated anticancer activities . Glucocorticoids enhance regeneration of murine olfactory epithelium . CONCLUSION : Glucocorticoid ( GC ) administration enhanced apoptotic changes in mature olfactory receptor neurons ( ORNs ) . GC administration may enhance regeneration of olfactory epithelium ( OE ) . OBJECTIVES : The mechanism underlying olfactory epithelial cells turnover involves apoptosis replaced by new ORNs . On regeneration of OE , we evaluated the apoptotic changes in OE . Our aim was to corroborate the enhancement of apoptosis of ORNs induced by GCs that are generally administered locally or systemically to patients with olfactory dysfunction . MATERIALS AND METHODS : For the in vitro study , we established cultured murine ORNs . DB00620 acetonide was added to culture supernatants . ORNs were then cultured for another 2 weeks . In the in vivo study , triamcinolone acetonide was administered to mice 5 or 10 times . The mice were dissected 3 days after the final injection , and the olfactory regions were removed and embedded in paraffin . All samples were examined by immunohistochemical staining and the TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling ( TUNEL ) method . RESULTS : P04150 ( GR ) expression of cultured murine ORNs was observed among ORNs at the mature stage . Expression of GRs by murine OE was localized on mature ORNs and supporting cells . Administration of GC to both cultured ORNs and mice resulted in proportions of apoptotic cells that were significantly higher than those in the control groups . Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 : a novel therapeutic target in necrotizing enterocolitis . Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is the most common gastrointestinal disease of infancy , afflicting 11 % of infants born 22-28 wk GA . Both inflammation and oxidation may be involved in NEC pathogenesis through reactive nitrogen species production , protein oxidation , and DNA damage . Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) is a critical enzyme activated to facilitate DNA repair using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) as a substrate . However , in the presence of severe oxidative stress and DNA damage , P09874 overactivation may ensue , depleting cells of NAD+ and DB00171 , killing them by metabolic catastrophe . Here , we tested the hypothesis that NO dysregulation in intestinal epithelial cells during NEC leads to marked P09874 expression and that administration of a P09874 inhibitor ( nicotinamide ) attenuates intestinal injury in a newborn rat model of NEC . In this model , 56 % of control pups developed NEC ( any stage ) versus 14 % of pups receiving nicotinamide . Forty-four percent of control pups developed high-grade NEC ( grades 3-4 ) , whereas only 7 % of pups receiving nicotinamide developed high-grade NEC . DB02701 treatment protects pups against intestinal injury incurred in the newborn rat NEC model . We speculate that P09874 overactivation in NEC may drive mucosal cell death in this disease and that P09874 may be a novel therapeutic target in NEC . Effects of inhaled prostacyclin analogue on chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension . Inhaled DB01240 has been reported to elicit pulmonary vasodilation , but whether it is also effective in treating chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension is still uncertain . We designed this study to address the in vivo effectiveness of inhaled DB05229 , a stable DB01240 analogue , on pulmonary vascular tone during hypoxic exposure in normoxic ( N ) and chronically hypoxic ( CH ) rats . Pulmonary vasodilation was observed by low-dose inhaled DB05229 in N rats , but not in CH rats . It was not until higher doses of DB05229 were given that pulmonary vasodilation was obtained in CH rats . When the agent was continuously administered by an intravascular route at the inhaled dose , it elicited no vasodilation in N rats . On the contrary , it elicited profound vasodilation in CH rats , although a concomitant systemic hypotension was observed . The P43119 mRNA expression was unchanged in the lungs of CH rats compared with that of N rats . We conclude that low doses of aerosolized DB05229 may reduce pulmonary vascular tone in rats without preexisting lung diseases . In contrast , when hypoxic pulmonary hypertension is present , the threshold of DB05229 inhalation was elevated to provoke pulmonary vasodilation . 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone suppress Janus kinase- P35610 inflammatory signaling through induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( O15524 ) and O14543 in glia . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma agonists are now emerging as therapeutic drugs for various inflammatory diseases . However , their molecular mechanism of action remains to be elucidated . Here we report a novel mechanism that underlies the P37231 agonist-mediated suppression of brain inflammation . We show that 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J(2) ( 15d-PGJ(2) ) and rosiglitazone reduce the phosphorylation of P42224 and P40763 as well as P23458 ( P23458 ) and O60674 in activated astrocytes and microglia . The P37231 agonist-mediated reduction in phosphorylation leads to the suppression of JAK- P35610 -dependent inflammatory responses . The effects of 15d-PGJ(2) and rosiglitazone are not mediated by activation of P37231 . 15d-PGJ(2) and rosiglitazone rapidly induce the transcription of suppressor of cytokine signaling ( Q9NSE2 ) 1 and 3 , which in turn inhibit JAK activity in activated glial cells . In addition , Src homology 2 domain-containing protein phosphatase 2 ( SHP2 ) , another negative regulator of JAK activity , is also involved in their anti-inflammatory action . Our data suggest that 15d-PGJ(2) and rosiglitazone suppress the initiation of JAK- P35610 inflammatory signaling independently of P37231 , thus attenuating brain inflammation . P09874 deficiency blocks P05113 expression through calpain-dependent degradation of P35610 -6 in a murine asthma model . BACKGROUND : We recently showed that poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) may play a role in allergen (ovalbumin)-induced airway eosinophilia , potentially through a specific effect on P05113 production . We also reported that while P05113 replenishment promotes reversal of eosinophilia in lungs of P09874 (-/-) mice , P05112 or Immunoglobulin E replenishment do not , suggesting a potentially significant regulatory relationship between P09874 and P05113 . OBJECTIVE : To explore the mechanism by which P09874 regulates P05113 production and to determine how P09874 inhibition blocks allergen-induced eosinophilia . METHODS : This study was conducted using a murine model of allergic airway inflammation and primary splenocytes . RESULTS : P09874 knockout-associated reduction in P05113 upon allergen exposure occurs at the mRNA level . Such an effect appears to take place after P05112 receptor activation as P09874 inhibition exerted no effect on P23458 / P52333 activation . Signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 ( P35610 -6 ) protein was severely downregulated in spleens of P09874 (-/-) mice without any effect on mRNA levels , suggesting an effect on protein integrity rather than gene transcription . Interestingly , the degradation of P35610 -6 in P09874 (-/-) mice required allergen stimulation . Additionally , P09874 enzymatic activity appears to be required for P35610 -6 integrity . The downregulation of P35610 -6 coincided with mRNA and protein reduction of GATA-binding protein-3 and occupancy of its binding site on the P05113 gene promoter . P05112 was sufficient to induce P35610 -6 downregulation in both P09874 (-/-) mice and isolated splenocytes . Such degradation may be mediated by calpain , but not by proteasomes . CONCLUSION : These results demonstrate a novel function of P09874 in regulating P05113 expression during allergen-induced inflammation and explain the underlying mechanism by which P09874 inhibition results in P05113 reduction . The polymorphisms S503P and Q576R in the interleukin-4 receptor alpha gene are associated with atopy and influence the signal transduction . P05112 ( P05112 ) plays a major role in immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) production . Its signal is conferred to effector cells through binding to the alpha chain of the P05112 receptor ( IL-4Ralpha ) . We present further evidence for polymorphisms in the IL-4Ralpha gene having an effect on IgE regulation . For two of four common polymorphisms , S503P and Q576R , we found an association with lowered total IgE concentrations ( P=0.0008 if occurring together ) . The polymorphism S503P has not yet been described and is located within the I4R motif of the receptor . In vitro analyses using synthetic peptides of this region showed that the tyrosine kinase P23458 ( P23458 ) , as well as P35568 and Q9Y4H2 bind to the I4R motif irrespective of the polymorphism or a tyrosine phosphorylation . In vivo immunoassays using T cells of four different groups of individuals ( S503/Q576 ; P503/Q576 ; S503/R576 ; P503/R576 ) revealed that only in case of both polymorphisms the phosphorylation of P35568 and Q9Y4H2 , but not P23458 was increased . We found no binding of P42226 to the I4R synthetic peptides ; however , the phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of any of the two polymorphisms , including P503 alone . We discuss possible conformational changes of the receptor leading to the observed effects on the phosphorylation status of P35568 , Q9Y4H2 and P42226 , in addition to previous findings that Q576R alters P42226 binding . We conclude that P503 and R576 influence the signal transduction pathways through the IL-4Ralpha , an effect that is magnified by the presence of both polymorphisms . This could explain the observed association effects with lowered total IgE concentrations . Differential role of two P11473 coactivators , Q15648 and Q9Y6Q9 , in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation . Cell programs such as proliferation and differentiation involve the selective activation and repression of gene expression . The vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , through 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) , controls the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes . Previously , we have identified two P11473 binding coactivator complexes . In proliferating keratinocytes P11473 bound preferentially to the DRIP complex , whereas in differentiated keratinocytes the P12931 complex was preferred . We proposed that different coactivators are required for sequential gene regulation in the transition from proliferation to differentiation . Here we examined the roles of Q15648 and Q9Y6Q9 in this transition . Silencing of Q15648 and P11473 caused hyperproliferation of keratinocytes , demonstrated by increased XTT and BrdU incorporation . Q9Y6Q9 silencing , on the other hand , did not have an effect on proliferation . In contrast , Q9Y6Q9 as well as Q15648 and P11473 silencing blocked keratinocyte differentiation as shown by decreased expression of keratin 1 and filaggrin . These results are consistent with the differential localization of Q15648 and Q9Y6Q9 in skin . These results indicate that Q15648 is required for keratinocyte proliferation . Both Q15648 and Q9Y6Q9 are required for the keratinocyte differentiation . These results support the concept that the selective use of coactivators by P11473 underlies the selective regulation of gene expression in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation . DB08877 for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis . PURPOSE : The pharmacology , pharmacokinetics , pharmacogenomics , clinical efficacy , and safety profile of ruxolitinib for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis are reviewed . SUMMARY : DB08877 , an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the Janus-associated kinases ( JAKs ) 1 and 2 , has been recently approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis . Unlike previous treatment options for patients with myelofibrosis , ruxolitinib offers a targeted therapy option for these patients who often suffer with severe and debilitating symptoms associated with the disease process . After oral administration , ruxolitinib is rapidly absorbed and can be given without regard to meals . DB08877 is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 ( CYP ) 3A4 isoenzyme system ; therefore , if concomitant use with a strong P08684 inhibitor is unavoidable , an initial dosage reduction is warranted . Two Phase III randomized trials comparing ruxolitinib to either placebo or best available therapy found a rapid and sustained response in the reduction of spleen size and improvements in constitutional symptoms and quality of life , with one study demonstrating an improvement in overall survival . The most commonly reported serious adverse effects of ruxolitinib are anemia and thrombocytopenia . DB08877 is administered as an oral tablet given twice daily , with the initial starting dosage based on the baseline platelet count . Dosage reductions are based on the development of thrombocytopenia . CONCLUSION : By directly targeting both P23458 and O60674 through small-molecule inhibition , ruxolitinib elicits a reduction in splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms in patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile and a low treatment-discontinuation rate . P43119 -induced P40763 phosphorylation in human erythroleukemia cells is mediated via Galpha(s) and Galpha(16) hybrid signaling . Human prostacyclin receptor ( hIP ) stimulates P40763 via pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins in human erythroleukemia ( HEL ) cells . Since hIP can utilize G(s) and G(q) proteins for signal transduction and that both G proteins can induce P40763 phosphorylation and activation via complex signaling networks , we sought to determine if one of them is predominant in mediating the hIP signal . Stimulation of P40763 DB00135 (705) and DB00133 (727) phosphorylations by the IP-specific agonist , cicaprost , was sensitive to inhibition of protein kinase A , phospholipase Cbeta , protein kinase C , calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and O60674 /3 . Unlike Galpha(16)-mediated regulation of P40763 in the same cells , cicaprost-induced P40763 DB00135 (705) phosphorylation was resistant to inhibition of Src and MEK while P40763 DB00133 (727) phosphorylation distinctly required phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase . This unique inhibitor-sensitivity pattern of P40763 phosphorylation was reproduced in HEL cells by stimulating the G(16)-coupled C5a receptor in the presence of dibutyryl- DB02527 , suggesting that the change in inhibitor-sensitivity was due to activation of the G(s) pathway . This postulation was confirmed by expressing constitutively active Galpha(16)QL and Galpha(s)QL in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the inhibitor-sensitivity of Galpha(16)QL-induced P40763 phosphorylations could be converted by the mere presence of Galpha(s)QL to resemble that obtained with cicaprost in HEL cells . In addition , the restoration of the Galpha(16)-mediated inhibitor-sensitivity upon cicaprost induction in Galpha(s)-knocked down HEL cells again verified the pivotal role of G(s) signal . Taken together , our observations illustrate that co-stimulation of G(s) and G(q) can result in the fine-tuning of P40763 activation status , and this may provide the basis for cell type-specific responses following activation of hIP . Met326Ile aminoacid polymorphism in the human p85 alpha gene has no major impact on early insulin signaling in type 2 diabetes . Class I alpha phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 3-kinase is an important enzyme in the early insulin signaling cascade , and plays a key role in insulin-mediated glucose transport . Despite extensive investigation , the genes responsible for the development of the common forms of type 2 diabetes remain unknown . This study was performed to identify variants in the coding region of p85 alpha , the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase . Fibroblasts from skin biopsies from type 2 diabetics and controls were established to address this issue . P85 alpha cDNA was sequenced , and a single point mutation at codon 326 was found . This mutation resulted in a homozygous missense amino acid change DB00134 --> DB00167 in one subject with type 2 diabetes and heterozygous variant in two other diabetic patients and one with severe insulin resistance . Interestingly , those patients revealed an impaired insulin-mediated insulin receptor substrate ( P41252 ) -1 binding to p85 alpha without any alteration in Q9Y4H2 /p85 alpha association . Furthermore , P35568 , Q9Y4H2 , p85 alpha and MAPK protein contents were not significantly changed , and neither were MAPK or Akt phosphorylation . We conclude from our data that this variant may have only minor impact on signaling events ; however , in combination with variants in other genes encoding signaling proteins , this may have a functional impact on early insulin signaling . Retinoic acid receptors in retinoid responsive ovarian cancer cell lines detected by polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription . The growth inhibitory effects of all-trans and 13-cis retinoic acid ( RA ) and of the synthetic retinoids DB02877 , DB02877 -ethylester and TTNN were studied on seven human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and one ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line . Six of seven ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines were inhibited in their growth by RA and by synthetic retinoids in a dose dependent manner . No response to these substances was observed for the ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line . The knowledge that RA and retinoids exert their action on the cells via nuclear receptors led us to examine the expression of P10276 , -beta and -gamma mRNA by these cell lines by polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription . All cell lines expressed P10276 and -gamma mRNA and six of the eight cell lines were found to express additionally P10826 mRNA , among them the ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line . Our data indicate that there was no direct association between the presence of RAR subtype transcripts and the response to retinoids in ovarian cancer cell lines . Interactions Between Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Kinase Inhibition , Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 Inhibition and P38398 Status in Breast Cancer Cells . BACKGROUND : Cells harboring P38398 / P51587 mutations are hypersensitive to inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) . We recently showed that interference with P09874 activity by DB02690 is strongly cytotoxic for P38398 -positive BT-20 cells but not P38398 -deficient SKBr-3 cells . These unexpected observations prompted speculation that other P09874 inhibitor(s) may be more cytotoxic towards SKBr-3 cells . In addition , interference with the DNA damage signaling pathway via ( for instance ) Q13315 ( Q13315 ) kinase inhibition may induce synthetic lethality in DNA repair-deficient breast cancer cells and pharmacological interference with Q13315 activity may sensitize breast cancer cells to P09874 inactivation . METHODS : We determined drug cytotoxicity in human MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells using the CellTiterGLO Luminescent cell viability assay and a Tecan multi-label , multitask plate counter to measure generated luminescence . Changes in cell cycle progression were monitored by flow cytometric measurement of DNA content in cells stained with propidium iodide . RESULTS : Unlike DB02690 , AZD2461 , a new P09874 inhibitor , markedly reduced the numbers of living MCF-7 and SKBr-3 cells . Q13315 kinase inhibition ( CP466722 ) was also cytotoxic for both MCF-7 and SKBr-3 cells . Furthermore , AZD2461 enhanced the cytotoxicity of CP466722 in both cell lines by inducing apoptosis , and concurrent inhibition of Q13315 and P09874 reduced cell proliferation more strongly than either single treatment . CONCLUSIONS : Our data show that inhibition of P09874 by AZD2461 is synthetically lethal for DB02690 -resistant MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells . They also indicate that DNA damage signaling is essential for survival of both SKBr-3 and MCF-7 cells , especially after inactivation of P09874 . Inhibition of related JAK/ P35610 pathways with molecular targeted drugs shows strong synergy with ruxolitinib in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm . This study aimed to assess the antitumour effects , molecular mechanisms of action , and potential synergy of ruxolitinib with sorafenib , KNK437 , dasatinib , and perifosine , in Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms ( Q9BQR3 ) . Cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of the different compounds were determined in the O60674 V617F-positive cell lines , HEL and Ba/ P13726 ( JAK2V617F P19235 ) , and in primary mononuclear and bone marrow P28906 -positive cells from 19 Q9BQR3 patients . DB08877 [ 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) (PV) = 15 nmol/l ] , as well as sorafenib ( IC50 PV=8μmol/l ) , KNK437 ( IC50 PV=100μmol/l ) , and perifosine ( IC50 PV=15μmol/l ) , were able to inhibit proliferation in cell line models and in primary cells from Q9BQR3 patients . Dasatinib , KNK437 , and sorafenib showed a strong synergistic effect in combination with ruxolitinib [ combination index ( CI ) (PV) < 0·3 ] . Western blot confirmed that ruxolitinib blocked P29323 , and consequently P42229 activation , sorafenib inhibited P29323 , O75791 and P42229 , dasatinib blocked P12931 and P42229 , and KNK437 decreased the stability of the O60674 protein , reducing its expression . Inhibiting O60674 -related proliferative pathways has the potential to inhibit cell proliferation in MPNs . Furthermore , the combination of ruxolitinib with inhibitors that target these pathways has a strong synergistic effect , which may be due to decreased activation of the common effector , P42229 . Conditional ablation of mediator subunit MED1 ( MED1/ Q15648 ) gene in mouse liver attenuates glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone-induced hepatic steatosis . P04150 ( GR ) agonist dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) induces hepatic steatosis and enhances constitutive androstane receptor ( CAR ) expression in the liver . CAR is known to worsen hepatic injury in nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis . Because transcription coactivator MED1/ Q15648 gene is required for GR- and CAR-mediated transcriptional activation , we hypothesized that disruption of MED1/ Q15648 gene in liver cells would result in the attenuation of DB00514 -induced hepatic steatosis . Here we show that liver-specific disruption of MED1 gene ( MED1 ( delta Liv ) ) improves DB00514 -induced steatotic phenotype in the liver . In wild-type mice DB00514 induced severe hepatic steatosis and caused reduction in medium- and short-chain acyl- DB01992 dehydrogenases that are responsible for mitochondrial beta-oxidation . In contrast , DB00514 did not induce hepatic steatosis in mice conditionally null for hepatic MED1 , as it failed to inhibit fatty acid oxidation enzymes in the liver . MED1 ( delta Liv ) livers had lower levels of GR-regulated CAR mRNA compared to wild-type mouse livers . Microarray gene expression profiling showed that absence of MED1 affects the expression of the GR-regulated genes responsible for energy metabolism in the liver . These results establish that absence of MED1 in the liver diminishes DB00514 -induced hepatic steatosis by altering the GR- and CAR-dependent gene functions . The JAK inhibitor , tofacitinib , reduces the T cell stimulatory capacity of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells . OBJECTIVE : DB08895 , which is a Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor , has shown clinical effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . JAKs are important kinases in lymphocyte differentiation ; however , their function in dendritic cells ( DCs ) is unknown . In this study , the function of JAKs in DCs was investigated with tofacitinib . METHODS : The effects of tofacitinib on the maturation of human monocyte-derived DCs induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation were investigated . In addition , its effects on T cell stimulatory capability was investigated by coculturing with naïve CD45RA-positive T cells . RESULTS : DB08895 decreased expression of P33681 / P42081 in a concentration-dependent manner in LPS-stimulated DCs ; however , it did not affect HLA-DR expression . DB08895 suppressed tumour necrosis factor , interleukin ( IL ) -6 and IL-1β production without affecting transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β and P22301 production . Meanwhile , P33681 / P42081 expression in DCs was enhanced by type I interferon ( IFN ) stimulation , and the LPS-induced P33681 / P42081 expression was inhibited by an antibody to type I IFN receptor . Furthermore , tofacitinib suppressed production of type I IFN and activation of interferon regulatory factor ( Q969Q1 ) -7 , which is a transcription factor involved in P33681 / P42081 and type I IFN expression . DB08895 also decreased the T cell stimulatory capability of DCs and increased expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( P14902 ) -1 and Q6ZQW0 . CONCLUSIONS : DB08895 , a P23458 / P52333 inhibitor , affected the activities of human DCs . It decreased P33681 / P42081 expression and T cell stimulatory capability through suppression of type I IFN signalling . These results suggest a novel mode of action for tofacitinib and a pivotal role for JAKs in the differentiation of DCs . Sequencing a mouse acute promyelocytic leukemia genome reveals genetic events relevant for disease progression . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . It is characterized by the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2) chromosomal translocation that creates the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α ( P29590 - P10276 ) fusion oncogene . Although this fusion oncogene is known to initiate APL in mice , other cooperating mutations , as yet ill defined , are important for disease pathogenesis . To identify these , we used a mouse model of APL , whereby P29590 - P10276 expressed in myeloid cells leads to a myeloproliferative disease that ultimately evolves into APL . Sequencing of a mouse APL genome revealed 3 somatic , nonsynonymous mutations relevant to APL pathogenesis , of which 1 ( Jak1 V657F ) was found to be recurrent in other affected mice . This mutation was identical to the P23458 V658F mutation previously found in human APL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples . Further analysis showed that P23458 V658F cooperated in vivo with P29590 - P10276 , causing a rapidly fatal leukemia in mice . We also discovered a somatic 150-kb deletion involving the lysine ( K ) -specific demethylase 6A ( Kdm6a , also known as Utx ) gene , in the mouse APL genome . Similar deletions were observed in 3 out of 14 additional mouse APL samples and 1 out of 150 human AML samples . In conclusion , whole genome sequencing of mouse cancer genomes can provide an unbiased and comprehensive approach for discovering functionally relevant mutations that are also present in human leukemias . The heme oxygenase system rescues hepatic deterioration in the condition of obesity co-morbid with type-2 diabetes . The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease ( NAFLD ) is increasing globally . NAFLD is a spectrum of related liver diseases that progressive from simple steatosis to serious complications like cirrhosis . The major pathophysiological driving of NAFLD includes elevated hepatic adiposity , increased hepatic triglycerides/cholesterol , excessive hepatic inflammation , and hepatocyte ballooning injury is a common histo-pathological denominator . Although heme-oxygenase ( HO ) is cytoprotective , its effects on hepatocyte ballooning injury have not been reported . We investigated the effects of upregulating HO with hemin or inhibiting it with stannous-mesoporphyrin ( DB04912 ) on hepatocyte ballooning injury , hepatic adiposity and inflammation in Zucker-diabetic-fatty rats ( ZDFs ) , an obese type-2-diabetic model . DB03404 administration to ZDFs abated hepatic/plasma triglycerides and cholesterol , and suppressed several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including , P01375 -α , P05231 , IL-1β , macrophage-inflammatory-protein-1α ( MIP-1α ) and macrophage-chemoattractant-protein-1 ( P13500 ) , with corresponding reduction of the pro-inflammatory M1-phenotype marker , Q92838 and hepatic macrophage infiltration . Correspondingly , hemin concomitantly potentiated the protein expression of several markers of the anti-inflammatory macrophage-M2-phenotype including ED2 , P22301 and CD-206 , alongside components of the HO-system including P09601 , HO-activity and cGMP , whereas the HO-inhibitor , DB04912 abolished the effects . Furthermore , hemin attenuated liver histo-pathological lesions like hepatocyte ballooning injury and fibrosis , and reduced extracellular-matrix/profibrotic proteins implicated in liver injury such as osteopontin , TGF-β1 , fibronectin and collagen-IV . We conclude that hemin restore hepatic morphology by abating hepatic adiposity , suppressing macrophage infiltration , inflammation and fibrosis . The selective enhancement of anti-inflammatory macrophage-M2-phenotype with parallel reduction of pro-inflammatory macrophage-M1-phenotype and related chemokines/cytokines like P01375 -α , P05231 , IL-1β , MIP-1α and P13500 are among the multifaceted mechanisms by which hemin restore hepatic morphology . Constitutive NF-kappaB activation confers interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) independence and resistance to dexamethasone and Janus kinase inhibitor DB08877 in murine plasmacytoma cells . Myeloma cells are dependent on P05231 for their survival and proliferation during the early stages of disease , and independence from P05231 is associated with disease progression . The role of the NF-κB pathway in the P05231 -independent growth of myeloma cells has not been studied . Because human herpesvirus 8-encoded P13646 selectively activates the NF-κB pathway , we have used it as a molecular tool to examine the ability of the NF-κB pathway to confer P05231 independence on murine plasmacytomas . We demonstrated that ectopic expression of P13646 , but not its NF-κB-defective mutant or a structural homolog , protected plasmacytomas against P05231 withdrawal-induced apoptosis and resulted in emergence of P05231 -independent clones that could proliferate long-term in vitro in the absence of P05231 and form abdominal plasmacytomas with visceral involvement when injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic mice . These P05231 -independent clones were dependent on NF-κB activity for their survival and proliferation but were resistant to dexamethasone and DB08877 , a selective P23458 /2 inhibitor . Ectopic expression of human T cell leukemia virus 1-encoded Tax protein , which resembles P13646 in inducing constitutive NF-κB activation , similarly protected plasmacytoma cells against P05231 withdrawal-induced apoptosis . Although P13646 is known to up-regulate P05231 gene expression , its protective effect was not due to induction of endogenous P05231 production but instead was associated with sustained expression of several antiapoptotic members of the Bcl2 family upon P05231 withdrawal . Collectively , these results demonstrate that NF-κB activation can not only promote the emergence of P05231 independence during myeloma progression but can also confer resistance to dexamethasone and DB08877 .
P00797 angiotensin system modulates P42345 pathway through AT2R in HIVAN . P42345 ( P42345 ) has been reported to contribute to the development of HIV-associated nephropathy ( HIVAN ) . We hypothesized that HIV may be activating renal tissue P42345 pathway through renin angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) via Angiotensin Receptor Type II receptor ( AT2R ) . Renal tissues of Vpr transgenic and Tg26 ( HIVAN ) mice displayed enhanced phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K . DB09026 , a renin inhibitor attenuated phosphorylation of both P42345 and p70S6K in renal tissues of HIVAN mice . Interestingly , Angiotensin Receptor Type I ( AT1R ) blockade did not modulate renal tissue phosphorylation of P42345 in HIVAN mice ; on the other hand , AT2R blockade attenuated renal tissue phosphorylation of P42345 in HIVAN mice . In vitro studies , both renin and Ang II displayed enhanced mouse tubular cell ( P04629 ) phosphorylation of p70S6K in a dose dependent manner . HIV/ P04629 also displayed enhanced phosphorylation of both P42345 and p70S6K ; interestingly this effect of HIV was further enhanced by losartan ( an AT1R blocker ) . On the other hand , AT2R blockade attenuated HIV-induced tubular cell phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K , whereas , AT2R agonist enhanced phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K . These findings indicate that HIV stimulates P42345 pathway in HIVAN through the activation of renin angiotensin system via AT2R . First report of warfarin dose requirements in patients possessing the P11712 *12 allele . BACKGROUND : DB00682 is the most frequently prescribed anticoagulant in North America and Europe . It is administered as a racemate , but S-warfarin is principally responsible for its anticoagulant activity . Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C9 is the enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolism of S-warfarin . Numerous variant alleles of P11712 have been identified . The P11712 *12 ( rs9332239 ) allele harbors a P489S substitution in P11712 which has been shown to result in a 40 % decline in catalytic activity in vitro . CASES : Four Caucasian patients with a low mean weekly warfarin dose ( MWWD ) were genotyped for P11712 , Q9BQB6 and P02649 variant alleles . None of the four patients carried the common P11712 variant alleles ( *2 , *3 , *5 , *6 , *7 , *8 , *9 , *11 , *13 ) despite a relatively low MWWD ( 23.4±7.94 mg ) compared to 208 patients carrying the CYP29C9*1 genotype ( 32.2±12.65 mg ) . Given that P11712 *12 confers decreased in vitro activity to the enzyme , we investigated whether these patients carried this allele . All four patients were P11712 *12 CT heterozygotes . Individual comparisons with patients possessing the same Q9BQB6 and P02649 genotypes also demonstrated lower dose requirements in the patients that possessed P11712 *12 allele . CONCLUSIONS : There are no reports of the clinical impact of rs9332239 on P11712 substrates . This is the first report of patients with the rare P11712 *12 genotype and lower warfarin dose requirements . Novel systemic markers for patients with Alzheimer disease ? - a pilot study . Almost 2 % of the population of western industrialized countries are affected by Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Nevertheless the pathogenetic process leading to this neurodegenerative disease is widely unknown . Thus , we focus on novel pathophysiological aspects of AD . We hypothesize that AD patients reveal increased levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) expressing proinflammatory ( P35354 , P01375 , P25942 ) , proapoptotic ( P09874 ) , adhesion-relevant ( P28907 ) or AD associated ( C99 , P56817 , P49768 ) proteins as well as elevated proinflammatory biochemical plasma parameters . Therefore , PBMCs of AD patients and age-matched control subjects were studied by two color fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis . Furthermore , concentration of plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) and P01375 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found a significantly increased percentage of P01375 , P35354 , P09874 , P28907 , C99 or presenilin-1 positive PBMCs in AD patients compared with healthy subjects . FACS analyses revealed that the percentage of C99 or presenilin-1 positive PBMCs , which also express P01375 , P35354 , P09874 or P28907 is also increased in AD patients . Additionally , AD patients had significantly increased plasma oxLDL and P01375 levels . Furthermore , we found positive correlations between plasma oxLDL or P01375 concentrations and the percentage of TNFalpha+ , P35354 + or P09874 + , as well as P49768 + , C99+ or P56817 + PBMCs . Our findings suggest that immunocytological investigations , based on immunophenotyping of AD relevant proteins combined with measurement of proinflammatory , proapoptotic and adhesion-relevant proteins in PBMCs may provide more insight into the pathophysiology of AD . Accumulation of autophagosomes contributes to enhanced amyloidogenic P05067 processing under insulin-resistant conditions . Alzheimer disease ( AD ) is sometimes referred to as type III diabetes because of the shared risk factors for the two disorders . P01308 resistance , one of the major components of type II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , is a known risk factor for AD . P01308 resistance increases amyloid-β peptide ( Aβ ) generation , but the exact mechanism underlying the linkage of insulin resistance to increased Aβ generation in the brain is unknown . In this study , we investigated the effect of insulin resistance on amyloid β ( A4 ) precursor protein ( P05067 ) processing in mice fed a high-fat diet ( HFD ) , and diabetic db/db mice . We found that insulin resistance promotes Aβ generation in the brain via altered insulin signal transduction , increased P56817 /β-secretase and γ-secretase activities , and accumulation of autophagosomes . Using an in vitro model of insulin resistance , we found that defects in insulin signal transduction affect autophagic flux by inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway . The insulin resistance-induced autophagosome accumulation resulted in alteration of P05067 processing through enrichment of secretase proteins in autophagosomes . We speculate that the insulin resistance that underlies the pathogenesis of T2DM might alter P05067 processing through autophagy activation , which might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD . Therefore , we propose that insulin resistance-induced autophagosome accumulation becomes a potential linker between AD and T2DM . [ Quantitative analysis of P11387 activity in human and rat glioma : characterization and mechanism of resistance to antitopoisomerase chemical , camptothecin-11 ] . DB00762 ( CPT-11 ) is a new derivation of camptothecin , a plant alkaloid antitumor agent . Previous studies indicated that antitumor activity of CPT-11 was mediated through interaction of the drugs with its target enzyme , P11387 ( topo I ) . In this study , we studied the relation between sensitivity to CPT-11 and topo I activity of glioma cells . Furthermore , we established CPT-11 resistant cell lines in order to elucidate potential mechanisms of drug resistance . A clear correlation between the sensitivities to CPT-11 and topo I activities in surgical glioma specimens was demonstrated . Activities of topo I in CPT-11 sensitive group ( IC50 values for CPT-11 ; < 50 micrograms/ml ) tended to be higher than those in CPT-11 resistant group ( IC50 values ; > or = 50 ) . Topo I activity may serve as a novel marker to predict the sensitivity of gliomas to topo inhibitors . CPT-11 resistance cell lines ( T98G/CPT-11 and P13671 ) respectively exhibit a 5.4- and 7.3-fold increase in resistance to CPT-11 . No differences in topo I activity and intracellular accumulation of CPT-11 were observed between parent and CPT-11 resistant lines . On the other hand , topo I from T98G/CPT-11 and P13671 /CPT-11 cells were at least 4- and 2-fold resistant to the inhibitory effect of the CPT-11 on the relaxation activity of topo I in comparison with their parent lines . This enzymological difference may be responsible for the resistance to CPT-11 . DB01098 , a new P04035 inhibitor , reduces the colonic inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice . The aim of the present study was to elucidate the beneficial effects of rosuvastatin , a new P04035 inhibitor , on colonic mucosal damage and on the inflammatory response in a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) colitis model . Acute colitis was induced using 8 % DSS in female BALB/c mice . Colonic mucosal inflammation was evaluated clinically , biochemically , and histologically . Mucosal protein contents and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha were determined by immunoassay and real time-PCR . The mRNA levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) were determined by real-time PCR . Disease activity scores in DSS-induced colitis model mice , as determined by weight loss , stool consistency , and blood in stool , were significantly lower in the rosuvastatin-treated mice than in control mice . Shortening of the colon was significantly reversed by rosuvastatin . Increases in tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances after DSS administration were both significantly inhibited by treatment with rosuvastatin . DB01098 also inhibited increases in intestinal P01375 protein and mRNA expression after DSS administration , respectively . The mucosal mRNA levels of P29474 were decreased after DSS administration , but preserved in mice treated with rosuvastatin . These results suggest that rosuvastatin prevents the development of DSS-induced colitis in mice via the inhibition of mucosal inflammatory responses associated with the preservation of P29474 transcription . Genetic factors influencing outcome from neurotrauma . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Clinical outcome after neurotrauma is considerably variable and can only partly be explained by known prognostic factors . There is converging evidence from genetic research that a number of genetic variants may contribute to this variability . This review provides recent data from human studies , published in the previous year , on genetic factors influencing outcome after neurotrauma . The bibliographic databases MEDLINE , EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched to identify relevant studies . RECENT FINDINGS : Genetic susceptibility to various aspects of clinical outcome after neurotrauma was reported in recent clinical studies . Genetic loci investigated include polymorphisms in P02649 , P21397 , P23560 , NOS3 , P05231 , P12036 , P31645 , P21964 , P48454 and Q8IX03 genes . The importance of these findings and future directions are discussed . SUMMARY : Recent genetic studies have revealed emerging aspects and extended the existing knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of neurotrauma and the genetic influence on phenotypic diversity . A better understanding of the underlying biological pathways and molecular mechanisms of an individual 's response to neurotrauma may hold the promise of novel treatment strategies and improved clinical outcome . Potentiator ivacaftor abrogates pharmacological correction of ΔF508 P13569 in cystic fibrosis . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) . Newly developed " correctors " such as DB09280 ( VX-809 ) that improve P13569 maturation and trafficking and " potentiators " such as ivacaftor ( VX-770 ) that enhance channel activity may provide important advances in CF therapy . Although VX-770 has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in the small subset of patients with a mutation ( G551D ) that affects only channel activity , a single compound is not sufficient to treat patients with the more common P13569 mutation , ΔF508 . Thus , patients with ΔF508 will likely require treatment with both correctors and potentiators to achieve clinical benefit . However , whereas the effectiveness of acute treatment with this drug combination has been demonstrated in vitro , the impact of chronic therapy has not been established . In studies of human primary airway epithelial cells , we found that both acute and chronic treatment with VX-770 improved P13569 function in cells with the G551D mutation , consistent with clinical studies . In contrast , chronic VX-770 administration caused a dose-dependent reversal of VX-809-mediated P13569 correction in ΔF508 homozygous cultures . This result reflected the destabilization of corrected ΔF508 P13569 by VX-770 , markedly increasing its turnover rate . Chronic VX-770 treatment also reduced mature wild-type P13569 levels and function . These findings demonstrate that chronic treatment with P13569 potentiators and correctors may have unexpected effects that can not be predicted from short-term studies . Combining these drugs to maximize rescue of ΔF508 P13569 may require changes in dosing and/or development of new potentiator compounds that do not interfere with P13569 stability . Ceramide stabilizes beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 and promotes amyloid beta-peptide biogenesis . The lipid second messenger ceramide regulates several biochemical events that occur during aging . In addition , its level is highly elevated in the amyloid-burdened brains of Alzheimer 's disease patients . Here , we analyzed the impact of aberrant ceramide levels on amyloid beta-peptide ( Abeta ) generation by using a cell-permeable analog of ceramide , P13671 -ceramide , and several biochemical inhibitors of the sphingomyelin/glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway . We found that P13671 -ceramide increased the biogenesis of Abeta by affecting beta-but not gamma-cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein . Similarly to P13671 -ceramide , increased levels of endogenous ceramide induced by neutral sphingomyelinase treatment also promoted the biogenesis of Abeta . Conversely , fumonisin B1 , which inhibits the biosynthesis of endogenous ceramide , reduced Abeta production . Exogenous P13671 -ceramide restored both intracellular ceramide levels and Abeta generation in fumonisin B1-treated cells . These events were specific for amyloid precursor protein and were not associated with apoptotic cell death . Pulse-chase and time-course degradation experiments showed that ceramide post-translationally stabilizes the beta-secretase P56817 . Taken together , these data indicate that the lipid second messenger ceramide , which is elevated in the brains of Alzheimer 's disease patients , increases the half-life of P56817 and thereby promotes Abeta biogenesis . Biophysical and pharmacological characterization of hypotonically activated chloride currents in cortical astrocytes . Rat cortical astrocytes regulate their cell volume in response to hypotonic challenge . This regulation is believed to depend largely on the release of chloride or organic osmolytes through anion channels . Using whole-cell recordings , we identified weakly outwardly rectifying chloride currents that could be activated in response to hypotonic challenge . These currents exhibited the following permeability sequence upon replacement of chloride in the bathing solution with various anions : I- > NO3- > Cl- > Gluc- > or = MeS- > Ise- . Interestingly , extracellular I- , albeit showing the greatest permeability , blocked the currents with an IC50 of approximately 50 mM . Currents were almost completely inhibited by 123 microM P16860 and partially inhibited by 200 microM niflumic acid or 200 microM DIDS . Additionally , the total number of Cl- ions effluxed through the hypotonically activated channels was markedly similar to the total solute efflux during volume regulation . We therefore propose the hypotonically activated chloride channel as a major contributor to volume regulation of astrocytes . To examine potential candidate chloride channel genes expressed by astrocytes , we employed RT-PCR to demonstrate the presence of transcripts for P51788 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 7 , as well as for P21796 and P13569 in cultured astrocytes . Moreover , we performed immunostaining with antibodies against each of these channels and showed the strongest expression of P51788 and P51790 , strong expression of P51795 and P21796 , weak expression of P51798 and very weak expression of P51793 and P13569 . Intriguingly , although we found at least seven Cl- channel proteins from three different gene families in astrocytes , none appeared to be active in resting cells . [ DB00707 sodium ( Photofrin-II ) ] . DB00707 sodium ( DB00707 ) is a photosensitizer which distributes selectively to tumor tissues , and causes tumor cell death by combination with light irradiation . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) by combination of porfimer sodium and laser was developed as a new cancer therapy . Tumor selectivity of porfimer sodium are based on the following reasons ; 1 ) high affinity for lipoprotein , especially , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , 2 ) elevation of P01130 activity in cancer tissue , and 3 ) lack or imcompleteness of lymphatic system in cancer tissue . DB00707 sodium is activated by laser irradiation at 630 nm , which can reacts with tissue oxygen to produce highly reactive excited siglet oxygen ( 1O2 ) . This highly reactive molecule is subsequently capable of killing tumor cells through oxidation of cellular component like mitochondrial enzymes . In addition , this highly reactive intermediate causes destruction of the tumor capillaries , which accelerates tumor cell death . The growth suppression or lethal damage to tumor cells by PDT of porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser were observed in experimental tumor models . In human clinical trials , the rates of complete response ( CR ) for roentgenographically occult lung cancer , stage I lung cancer , superficial esophageal cancer , superficial gastric cancer and carcinoma in situ or dysplasia of the cervix were 84.8 % , 50.0 % , 90.0 % , 87.5 % and 94.4 % , respectively . The major side effects were cutaneous symptoms e.g. photosensitivity , pigmentation , increasing GOT , GPT but these symptoms were not severe . PDT using porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser must be clinically useful for the treatment of inoperable early cancer or conservation of organ functions . Herpes simplex virus infection causes cellular beta-amyloid accumulation and secretase upregulation . It is uncertain whether environmental factors contribute to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , the abnormal features that define the Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) brain . We previously proposed that herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV1 ) is a strong risk factor for AD when it is present in the brains of people who possess the type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene ( P02649 -epsilon4 ) ; however a direct biochemical link between viral infection and the development of the AD pathological features has never previously been examined . Here we show that infection of cultured neuronal and glial cells with HSV1 leads to a dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) 1-40 and 1-42 , whilst levels of amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) in cells decrease . Similarly , Abeta1-42 deposits are present in mouse brain after HSV1 infection . In the cultured cells the mechanism involves increased Abeta production , rather than merely greater retention of cellular Abeta , as levels of beta-site P05067 -cleaving enzyme ( P56817 -1 ) and of nicastrin , a component of gamma-secretase , both increase in HSV1-infected cells . These novel data show that HSV1 can directly contribute to the development of senile plaques . The influence of costimulation and regulatory P01730 + T cells on intestinal IgA immune responses . It is thought that IgA B-cell differentiation is highly dependent on activated P01730 + T cells . In particular , cell-cell interactions in the Peyer 's patches involving P25942 and/or P33681 / P42081 have been implicated in germinal-center formation and IgA B-cell development . Also soluble factors , such as P05112 , P05113 , P05231 , and TGF beta may be critical for IgA B-cell differentiation in vivo . Here we report on some paradoxical findings with regard to IgA B-cell differentiation and specific mucosal immune responses that we have recently made using gene knockout mice . More specifically , we have investigated to what extent absence of P01730 + T cells , relevant cytokines , or T-cell-B-cell interactions would influence IgA B-cell differentiation in vivo . Using P01730 - or P05112 -gene knockout mice or mice made transgenic for DB01281 , we found that , although specific responses were impaired , total IgA production and IgA B-cell differentiation appeared to proceed normally . However , a poor correlation was found between , on the one hand , GC formation and IgA differentiation and , on the other hand , the ability to respond to T-cell-dependent soluble protein antigens in these mice . Thus , despite the various deficiencies in P01730 + T-cell functions seemingly intact IgA B-cell development was observed . P01130 -related protein promotes amyloid precursor protein trafficking to lipid rafts in the endocytic pathway . The major defining pathological hallmark of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is the accumulation of amyloid beta protein ( Abeta ) , a small peptide derived from beta- and gamma-secretase cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) . Recent studies have shown that beta- and gamma-secretase activities of P56817 and presenilin , respectively , are concentrated in intracellular lipid raft microdomains . However , the manner in which P05067 normally traffics to lipid rafts is unknown . In this study , using transient transfection and immuno-precipitation assays , we show that the cytoplasmic domain of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ( Q14764 ) interacts with P05067 and increases Abeta secretion and P05067 beta-CTF ( C-terminal fragment ) generation by promoting P56817 - P05067 interaction . We also employed discontinuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to show that the Q14764 cytoplasmic domain-mediated effect was accompanied by greatly increased localization of P05067 and P56817 to lipid raft membranes , where beta- and gamma-secretase activities are highly enriched . Moreover , we provide evidence that endogenous Q14764 is required for the normal delivery of P05067 to lipid rafts and Abeta generation primarily in the endocytic but not secretory pathway . These results may provide novel insights to block Abeta generation by targeting Q14764 -mediated delivery of P05067 to raft microdomains . Splice variants : a homology modeling approach . Splice variants play an important role within the cell in both increasing the proteome diversity and in cellular function . Splice variants are also associated with disease states and may play a role in their etiology . Information about splice variants has , until now , mostly been derived from the primary transcript or through cellular studies . In this study information from the transcript and other studies is combined with tertiary structure information derived from homology models . Through this method we have determined that it is possible to effectively model splice variants . Forty models of splice variants for fourteen proteins were produced . Analysis of the models shows that deletions produce superior model validation values . Additions to sequences where there is little homology become increasingly difficult to model with increasing sequence length . Many of the splicing events are associated with post-translational modification either in the N-terminal region by changing the signal peptide or by affecting the number or availability of glycosylation sites . Often the alternative exon combinations are associated with loss or gain of whole structural units , as opposed to just changing small loop regions . Losing part of the secondary structure may destabilize neighboring parts of the same secondary structure . Detailed analysis is given of four biomedically relevant proteins ( Beta-site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving enzyme ( P56817 ) , P05112 , Frataxin and Q30201 ) and their associated splice variant models . The visualization of these possible structures provides new insights about their functionality and the possible etiology of associated diseases . Fetzima ( levomilnacipran ) , a drug for major depressive disorder as a dual inhibitor for human serotonin transporters and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 . Pharmacological management of Major Depressive Disorder includes the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors which targets serotonin transporters ( P31645 ) to increase the synaptic concentrations of serotonin . Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 ( P56817 -1 ) is responsible for amyloid β plaque formation . Hence it is an interesting target for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) therapy . This study describes molecular interactions of a new Food and Drug Administration approved antidepressant drug named ' Fetzima ' with P56817 -1 and P31645 . Fetzima is chemically known as levomilnacipran . The study has explored a possible link between the treatment of Depression and AD . ' Autodock 4.2 ' was used for docking study . The free energy of binding ( ΔG ) values for ' levomilnacipran- P31645 ' interaction and ' levomilnacipran- P56817 ' interaction were found to be -7.47 and -8.25 kcal/mol , respectively . DB08918 was found to interact with S438 , known to be the most important amino acid residue of serotonin binding site of P31645 during ' levomilnacipran- P31645 ' interaction . In the case of ' levomilnacipran- P56817 ' interaction , levomilnacipran interacted with two very crucial aspartic acid residues of P56817 -1 , namely , D32 and D228 . These residues are accountable for the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and the subsequent formation of amyloid β plaques in AD brain . Hence , Fetzima ( levomilnacipran ) might act as a potent dual inhibitor of P31645 and P56817 -1 and expected to form the basis of a future dual therapy against depression and AD . It is an established fact that development of AD is associated with Major Depressive Disorder . Therefore , the design of new P56817 -1 inhibitors based on antidepressant drug scaffolds would be particularly beneficial . Apoptogenic interactions of plasmalemmal type-1 P21796 and Aβ peptides via GxxxG motifs induce Alzheimer 's disease - a basic model of apoptosis ? Human type-1 porin/ P21796 ( voltage-dependent anion channel ) carries a GxxxG motif in its N-terminal part , traversing the β-barrel , while the Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) relevant amyloid peptides Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 show a series of corresponding motifs close to their C-terminus . GxxxG motifs are established as aggregation/membrane perturbation motifs . These peptide primary structure data support a proposal I recently made on the basis of a synopsis of recent literature . Accordingly , amyloid Aβ , cut from P05067 by beta-secretase P56817 and gamma-secretase , has been insinuated to induce Alzheimer 's disease via apoptosis by opening type-1 porin/ P21796 in cell membranes of hypometabolic neuronal cells . Considering the ubiquitous expression modus of P05067 , beta- and gamma-secretases and type-1 P21796 /eukaryotic porin a basic model of apoptosis might be given . Is phentermine an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase ? A critical appraisal . DB00191 produces a spectrum of concentration-dependent biochemical effects . It interacts with NE transporters at 0.1 microM , DA transporters at about 1 microM , 5-HT transporters at 15 microM and P21397 at about 100 microM . When administered at typical anorectic doses , phentermine primarily interacts with DA and NE transporters and does not produce biochemical or neurochemical effects which would occur if it were inhibiting P21397 . Some other explanation other than MAO inhibition must be sought to explain how oral phentermine increases platelet 5-HT , since platelet P27338 does not metabolize platelet 5-HT , and since amphetamine-type drugs are even weaker inhibitors of P27338 than P21397 . Clinical studies in humans have shown that amphetamine , which is a more potent inhibitor of P21397 than phentermine , does not inhibit P21397 at therapeutic doses . Neither phentermine alone , fluoxetine alone or their combined use have been associated with cardiac valvulopathy , and clinical experience has shown their combined use to be free of significant adverse effects . Viewed collectively , there appears to be no data to support the hypothesis that phentermine inhibits MAO at typical therapeutic doses . Cluster analysis of risk factor genetic polymorphisms in Alzheimer 's disease . Multiple genetic variants may contribute to the risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease . We have analyzed polymorphisms in 9 genes to determine whether particular combinations would contribute to this risk . The genes were P02649 , LDLr , P01034 , P07339 , P01375 , P56817 , P10636 , Q8IWL8 , P29474 , and Q12800 . Three risk groups for the disease were identified . Risk group I was younger , was heterozygous for the P01034 ( GA ) , CTSD2936 ( AG ) , P01375 -308 ( AG ) genetic variants . Risk group II was older , was homozygous for the -427 P02649 promoter polymorphism ( TT ) , and heterozygous for the P10636 deletion and for the Q8IWL8 variant ( QR ) . Group III had both the youngest and oldest subjects , were heterozygous for the -863 ( AC ) and -1031 ( CT ) P01375 promoter polymorphisms . All three groups carried the P02649 4 allele and were heterozygous for both P56817 polymorphisms . The control groups were carriers of the P02649 3 allele and were homozygous for the P56817 genetic variants . DB00588 -induced regulation of the balance within macrophage subpopulations . In asthma , treatment with inhaled corticosteroids reduces chronic peribronchial inflammation and restores the balance within macrophage subpopulations . This study investigates whether corticosteroids can regulate monocyte differentiation in vitro and thereby influence the balance of functionally distinct macrophages . Graded doses of fluticasone propionate ( FP ) were added to cultures of normal peripheral blood monocytes in the presence or absence of P05112 . Cells were harvested after 7 days ' culture . Double immunofluorescence studies were performed on cytospins of differentiated macrophages using the MoAbs RFD1 and RFD7 to distinguish inductive and suppressive macrophages by their respective phenotypes . Macrophage function was determined by quantifying allostimulation in a mixed leucocyte reaction and by measuring tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) production . FP reduced the number of mature cells with a D1+ antigen-presenting phenotype and up-regulated the development of cells with the D1/D7+ and D7+ phenotypes . Functionally , this was associated with reduced stimulation of T cell proliferation in a mixed leucocyte reaction ( P08235 ) . DB00588 also reversed the increase in both D1+ expression and P01375 production induced by P05112 . The effect of FP persisted for 24 h after removal of FP from the culture medium . These results suggest that FP treatment of asthmatics may have a direct beneficial effect by normalizing the macrophage subset imbalance that contributes to the chronic peribronchial inflammation present in this condition .
P14416 signaling dynamics of dopamine D2-neurotensin 1 receptor heteromers . Biochemical , histochemical and coimmunoprecipitation experiments have indicated the existence of antagonistic dopamine D2 ( D2R ) and neurotensin 1 ( NTS1R ) receptor-receptor interactions in the dorsal and ventral striatum indicating a potential role of these receptor-receptor interactions in Parkinson 's disease and schizophrenia . By means of Bioluminiscence Resonance energy transfer ( BRET(2) ) evidence has for the first time been obtained in the current study for the existence of both D2LR/NTS1R and D2SR/NTS1R heteromers in living HEK293T cells . Through confocal laser microscopy the NTS1R(GFP2) and D2R(YFP) were also shown to be colocated in the plasma membrane of these cells . A bioinformatic analysis suggests the existence of a basic set of three homology protriplets ( TVM , DLL and/or LRA ) in the two participating receptors which may contribute to the formation of the D2R/NTS1R heteromers by participating in guide-clasp interactions in the receptor interface . The CREB reporter gene assay indicated that the neurotensin receptor agonist JMV 449 markedly reduced the potency of the D2R like agonist quinpirole to inhibit the forskolin induced increase of the CREB signal . In contrast , the neurotensin agonist was found to markedly increase the quinpirole potency to activate the MAPK pathway as also studied with luciferase reporter gene assay measuring the degree of SRE activity as well as with P27361 /2 phosphorylation assays . These dynamic changes in D2R signaling produced by the neurotensin receptor agonist may involve antagonistic allosteric receptor-receptor interactions in the D2LR-NTS1R heteromers at the plasma membrane level ( CREB pathway ) and synergistic interactions in PKC activation at the cytoplasmatic level ( MAPK pathway ) . Application of HapMap data to the evaluation of 8 candidate genes for pediatric slow transit constipation . BACKGROUND : Slow transit constipation ( P52823 ) affects up to 3 % of all children and is an increasingly recognized cause of chronic constipation in children . We conducted a pilot study to investigate whether genes encoding neurotransmitters ( P20366 , Q9UHF0 , P01282 , NOS1 ) and receptors ( P25103 , P21452 , P29371 , P10721 ) could be responsible for P52823 . METHODS : One hundred seventeen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , distributed among the candidate genes , were selected from HapMap data and genotyped using Sequenom ( San Diego , CA ) technology in 35 affected families . Evaluation of association was performed by transmission disequilibrium test and multilocus analysis . RESULTS : Five SNPs ( rs3771863 , rs4580655 , rs11722288 , rs4563545 , and rs3782221 ) in the P25103 , P29371 , P10721 , and NOS1 genes were found to be potentially associated with P52823 , although the significance of these results does not withstand correction for multiple testing . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicate that 5 SNPs in the NOS1 , P25103 , P29371 , and P10721 genes could be involved in P52823 , especially rs3771863 in intron 1 of P25103 , which showed the highest association . Effects of maternal smoking on the placental expression of genes related to angiogenesis and apoptosis during the first trimester . OBJECTIVE : Maternal cigarette smoking is reportedly associated with miscarriage , fetal growth restriction and placental abruption , and is paradoxically associated with a decreased risk of developing preeclampsia . In the present study , we investigated the gene expression levels of villous tissues in early gestation . We compared the expression levels of the genes related to angiogenesis and apoptosis in the villous tissues obtained from smoking and non-smoking pregnant women . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We collected villous tissue samples from 57 women requesting surgical termination due to non-medical reasons at 6-8 weeks of gestation . The maternal cigarette smoking status was evaluated by the level of serum cotinine and patients were divided into active smokers and non-smokers by the serum cotinine level . The placental levels of P15692 , P49763 , P17948 , Q16665 , P04637 , Q07812 and P10415 mRNA were quantified by real time PCR . RESULTS : The gene expression level of P49763 and Q16665 in the active smoker group was significantly higher than that in the non-smoker group . We did not observe any significant differences in the P15692 or P17948 expression between the groups . In active smoker group , the gene expression levels of P04637 and Q07812 were significantly higher than those in the non-smoker group . The ratio of Q07812 / P10415 mRNA in the active smoker group was significantly higher than that in the non-smoker group . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings revealed that smoking might affect the placenta during early pregnancy . Maternal cigarette smoking in early pregnancy may be associated with villus hypoxia , which may influence angiogenesis and apoptosis . Interaction of tacrolimus(FK506) and its metabolites with FKBP and calcineurin . DB00864 (FK506) is a strong immuno-suppressant and shows its activity through inhibiting P60568 mRNA transcription by forming pentameric complex with intracellular receptor ( FK506 binding protein 12 kDa or P62942 ) , Ca2+ , calmodulin , and calcineurin . Here , we report the binding activity to P62942 , the pentameric complex formation and Con-A response inhibiting activities of 7 metabolites . C15-demethylated metabolite(M-3) needed higher quantity to compete in Con-A assay and in pentamer formation assay , although it binds more strongly to P62942 . The result suggests that the ability to form a pentameric complex is not a two step reaction with the first binding to P62942 , but a single step reaction by components for the pentamer formation . Signatures of positive selection in genes associated with human skin pigmentation as revealed from analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms . Phenotypic variation between human populations in skin pigmentation correlates with latitude at the continental level . A large number of hypotheses involving genetic adaptation have been proposed to explain human variation in skin colour , but only limited genetic evidence for positive selection has been presented . To shed light on the evolutionary genetic history of human variation in skin colour we inspected 118 genes associated with skin pigmentation in the Perlegen dataset , studying single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , and analyzed 55 genes in detail . We identified eight genes that are associated with the melanin pathway ( Q9UMX9 , Q04671 , P17643 , P40126 , P21583 , P00533 , P14416 and Q03181 ) and presented significant differences in genetic variation between Europeans , Africans and Asians . In six of these genes we detected , by means of the EHH test , variability patterns that are compatible with the hypothesis of local positive selection in Europeans ( Q04671 , P17643 and P21583 ) and in Asians ( Q04671 , P40126 , P21583 , P00533 and P14416 ) , whereas signals were scarce in Africans ( P40126 , P00533 and P14416 ) . Furthermore , a statistically significant correlation between genotypic variation in four pigmentation candidate genes and phenotypic variation of skin colour in 51 worldwide human populations was revealed . Overall , our data also suggest that light skin colour is the derived state and is of independent origin in Europeans and Asians , whereas dark skin color seems of unique origin , reflecting the ancestral state in humans . Risk stratification of intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia : integrative analysis of a multitude of gene mutation and gene expression markers . Numerous molecular markers have been recently discovered as potential prognostic factors in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . It has become of critical importance to thoroughly evaluate their interrelationships and relative prognostic importance . Gene expression profiling was conducted in a well-characterized cohort of 439 AML patients ( age < 60 years ) to determine expression levels of EVI1 , P19544 , P10415 , P08183 , Q8WXS3 , P36888 , P28906 , P14902 , ERG and Q10571 . A variety of AML-specific mutations were evaluated , that is , P36888 , P06748 , N- DB01367 , K- DB01367 , O75874 , P48735 , and P49715 (DM/SM) ( double/single ) . Univariable survival analysis shows that ( 1 ) patients with P36888 (ITD) mutations have inferior overall survival ( OS ) and event-free survival ( O43281 ) , whereas P49715 (DM) and P06748 mutations indicate favorable OS and O43281 in intermediate-risk AML , and ( 2 ) high transcript levels of Q8WXS3 , P28906 , Q10571 , EVl1 , and ERG predict inferior OS and O43281 . In multivariable survival analysis , P28906 , ERG , and P49715 (DM) remain significant . Using survival tree and regression methodologies , we show that P49715 (DM) , P28906 , and P48735 mutations are capable of separating the intermediate group into 2 AML subgroups with highly distinctive survival characteristics ( OS at 60 months : 51.9 % vs 14.9 % ) . The integrated statistical approach demonstrates that from the multitude of biomarkers a greatly condensed subset can be selected for improved stratification of intermediate-risk AML . Dependence on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and DB01367 -RAF pathways drive the activity of RAF265 , a novel RAF/ P35968 inhibitor , and RAD001 ( DB01590 ) in combination . Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) -AKT and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue ( P01116 ) can induce cellular immortalization , proliferation , and resistance to anticancer therapeutics such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors or chemotherapy . This study assessed the consequences of inhibiting these two pathways in tumor cells with activation of P01116 , PI3K-AKT , or both . We investigated whether the combination of a novel RAF/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor , RAF265 , with a mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) inhibitor , RAD001 ( everolimus ) , could lead to enhanced antitumoral effects in vitro and in vivo . To address this question , we used cell lines with different status regarding P01116 , P42336 , and P15056 mutations , using immunoblotting to evaluate the inhibitors , and MTT and clonogenic assays for effects on cell viability and proliferation . Subcutaneous xenografts were used to assess the activity of the combination in vivo . RAD001 inhibited P42345 downstream signaling in all cell lines , whereas RAF265 inhibited RAF downstream signaling only in P15056 mutant cells . In vitro , addition of RAF265 to RAD001 led to decreased AKT , S6 , and P06730 binding protein 1 phosphorylation in HCT116 cells . In vitro and in vivo , RAD001 addition enhanced the antitumoral effect of RAF265 in HCT116 and H460 cells ( both P01116 mut , P42336 mut ) ; in contrast , the combination of RAF265 and RAD001 yielded no additional activity in A549 and MDAMB231 cells . The combination of RAF and P42345 inhibitors is effective for enhancing antitumoral effects in cells with deregulation of both DB01367 -RAF and PI3K , possibly through the cross-inhibition of 4E binding protein 1 and S6 protein . Fibroblast growth factor-2 in hyperplastic pituitaries of D2R knockout female mice . P14416 ( D2R ) knockout ( KO ) female mice develop chronic hyperprolactinemia and pituitary hyperplasia . Our objective was to study the expression of the mitogen fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) and its receptor , P11362 , comparatively in pituitaries from KO and wild-type ( WT ) female mice . We also evaluated P09038 subcellular localization and P09038 effects on pituitary function . P09038 -induced prolactin release showed a similar response pattern in both genotypes , even though basal and P09038 -stimulated release was higher in KO . P09038 stimulated pituitary cellular proliferation ( MTS assay and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation ) , with no differences between genotypes . P09038 concentration ( measured by ELISA ) in whole pituitaries or cultured cells was lower in KO ( P < 0.00001 and 0.00014 ) . Immunofluorescence histochemistry showed less P09038 in pituitaries from KO females and revealed a distinct P09038 localization pattern between genotypes , being predominantly nuclear in KO and cytosolic in WT pituitaries . Finally , P09038 could not be detected in the conditioned media from pituitary cultures of both genotypes . P11362 levels ( Western blot and immunohistochemistry ) were higher in pituitaries of KO . Basal concentration of phosphorylated ERKs was lower in KO cells ( P = 0.018 ) . However , when stimulated with P09038 , a significantly higher increment of P29323 phosphorylation was evidenced in KO cells ( P < or = 0.02 ) . We conclude that disruption of the D2R caused an overall decrease in pituitary P09038 levels , with an increased distribution in the nucleus , and increased P11362 levels . These results are important in the search for reliable prognostic indicators for patients with pituitary dopamine-resistant prolactinomas , which will make tumor-specific therapy possible . Efficacy and safety of repeated dosing of netupitant , a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist , in treating overactive bladder . AIM : NK-1 receptors in sensory nerves , the spinal cord and bladder smooth muscle participate in complex sensory mechanisms that regulate bladder activity . This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a new P25103 antagonist , netupitant , in patients with OAB . METHODS : This was a phase II , multicenter , double-blind study in which adults with OAB symptoms > 6 months were randomized to receive 1 of 3 doses of netupitant ( 50 , 100 , 200 mg ) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks . The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in average number of daily micturitions at week 8 . Urinary incontinence , urge urinary incontinence ( UUI ) , and urgency episodes were also assessed . RESULTS : The primary efficacy endpoint was similar in the treatment groups ( -13.85 for placebo to -16.17 in the netupitant 200 mg group ) with no statistically significant differences between netupitant and placebo . The same was true for most secondary endpoints although a significant difference for improvement in UUI episodes and a trend for the greatest decrease in urgency episodes were seen in the netupitant 100 mg group . DB09048 was well tolerated with most treatment emergent adverse events ( AEs ) being mild . While the overall incidence of AEs increased with netupitant dose , there was no evidence for this dose dependency based on relationship to treatment , intensity , or time to onset . CONCLUSIONS : The study failed to demonstrate superiority of netupitant versus placebo in decreasing OAB symptoms , despite a trend favoring netupitant 100 mg . There were no safety concerns with daily administration of netupitant over 8 weeks . Phorbol ester-mediated inhibition of growth and regulation of proto-oncogene expression in the human T cell leukemia line JURKAT . The expression and function of several proto-oncogenes were examined in a human acute T cell leukemia line , JURKAT , during phorbol ester-induced terminal differentiation . Treating JURKAT cells with the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate ( TPA ) inhibited their proliferation and induced expression of the gene for the interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain ( IL2R-alpha ) , consistent with previous reports . In unstimulated proliferating JURKAT cells , high levels of C-MYC , N- DB01367 , and P10415 mRNAs were found that diminished rapidly following TPA-induced cessation of growth . In contrast , accumulation of mRNAs for the C- P01100 , C- P05412 , and P18146 genes increased markedly in TPA-treated cells and preceded the induction of IL2R-alpha mRNA . Expression of C- P10242 , C-RAF-1 , C- P06239 , C- P06241 , and C- P09769 proto-oncogenes was relatively unchanged . To explore directly the function of two of these protooncogenes in regulating the growth of JURKAT T cells , we stably transferred C-MYC and P10415 expression plasmids into these cells . Despite sustained expression of C-MYC , P10415 , or the combination of these protooncogenes , TPA continued to inhibit JURKAT cell growth and to induce IL2R expression . Thus , although C-MYC and P10415 proto-oncogene expression correlated with proliferation in TPA-treated JURKAT cells , continuous over-expression of even the combination of these oncogenes was insufficient for abrogating the effects of TPA in these leukemic T cells . Because human lymphoid malignancies frequently contain chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of C-MYC and P10415 , our findings could have relevance for attempts to induce terminal differentiation of leukemic cells by in vitro exposure of patients ' bone marrow cells to phorbol esters . Unbiased screen for interactors of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 supports a common pathway for sporadic and familial Parkinson disease . Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( Q5S007 ) cause inherited Parkinson disease ( PD ) , and common variants around Q5S007 are a risk factor for sporadic PD . Using protein-protein interaction arrays , we identified P10415 -associated athanogene 5 , Rab7L1 ( P51149 , member DB01367 oncogene family-like 1 ) , and O14976 as binding partners of Q5S007 . The latter two genes are candidate genes for risk for sporadic PD identified by genome-wide association studies . These proteins form a complex that promotes clearance of Golgi-derived vesicles through the autophagy-lysosome system both in vitro and in vivo . We propose that three different genes for PD have a common biological function . More generally , data integration from multiple unbiased screens can provide insight into human disease mechanisms . Aberrant microRNA expression likely controls DB01367 oncogene activation during malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial and stem cells by arsenic . Inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) , a human carcinogen , potentially targets the prostate . iAs malignantly transforms the RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial line to CAsE-PE cells , and a derivative normal stem cell ( SC ) line , WPE-stem , to As-Cancer SC ( As-CSC ) line . MicroRNAs ( miRNA ) are noncoding but exert negative control on expression by degradation or translational repression of target mRNAs . Aberrant miRNA expression is important in carcinogenesis . A miRNA array of CAsE-PE and As-CSC revealed common altered expression in both for pathways concerning oncogenesis , miRNA biogenesis , cell signaling , proliferation , and tumor metastasis and invasion . The P01116 oncogene is overexpressed in CAsE-PE cells but not by mutation or promoter hypomethylation , and is intensely overexpressed in As-CSC cells . In both transformants , decreased miRNAs targeting P01116 and DB01367 superfamily members occurred . Reduced miR-134 , miR-373 , miR-155 , miR-138 , miR-205 , miR-181d , miR-181c , and let-7 in CAsE-PE cells correlated with increased target DB01367 oncogenes , RAN , P51159 , Q9UL26 mRNAs , and P01116 protein . Reduced miR-143 , miR-34c-5p , and miR-205 in As-CSC correlated with increased target RAN mRNA , and P01116 , P01111 , and P10301 proteins . The DB01367 / P29323 and PI3K/ P60484 /AKT pathways control cell survival , differentiation , and proliferation , and when dysregulated promote a cancer phenotype . iAs transformation increased expression of activated P29323 kinase in both transformants and altered components of the PI3K/ P60484 /AKT pathway including decreased P60484 and increases in P10415 , BCL-XL , and P15692 in the absence of AKT activation . Thus , dysregulated miRNA expression may be linked to DB01367 activation in both transformants . P01133 -like ligands mediate progesterone 's anti-apoptotic action on macaque granulosa cells . A local autocrine/paracrine role for progesterone is an absolute requirement for corpus luteum formation in primates . Despite this , the mechanism(s) remain obscure , although existing data suggest an anti-apoptotic action to be central . There are a limited number of progestin-regulated gene targets identified in the luteinizing primate follicle , suggesting that a small number of important genes may mediate progesterone action . Possible gene targets could be the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) family members amphiregulin ( P15514 ) and epiregulin ( O14944 ) . Using macaques undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation cycles , we show that the phosphorylation of P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) , P29323 1/2 , and AKT increases 6 h after an ovulatory human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) stimulus and remains activate through 24 h . Immunoreactive O14944 and P15514 ligands in the follicular fluid both increased in a time frame commensurate with P00533 phosphorylation . The mRNA expression of P15514 and O14944 in nonluteinized granulosa cells ( NLGC ) was induced in culture with hCG , an effect blocked by progesterone receptor ( P06401 ) antagonists . Overexpression of P06401 B in NLGC and treatment with a nonmetabolizable progestin did not increase either gene , indicating both progesterone and luteinizing hormone/CG are necessary . Addition of P01133 and P01133 -like ligands did not promote steroidogenesis in vitro by granulosa cells in the presence of gonadotropin , but were able to partially reverse DB00834 -induced cell death . These data suggest that progesterone promotes the expression of P15514 and O14944 , which in turn maintain viability of luteinizing granulosa cells , representing one possible mechanism whereby progesterone promotes corpus luteum formation in the primate . P42345 inhibitor RAD001 ( DB01590 ) enhances the effects of imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia by raising the nuclear expression of c- P00519 protein . Constitutive tyrosine kinase ( TK ) activity of Q92817 P11274 - P00519 fusion protein of chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) usurps physiological functions of normal p145 c- P00519 protein . Accordingly , its inhibition by imatinib mesylate ( IM ) lets p145 c- P00519 translocate into the nuclear compartment , which drives cell growth arrest and apoptotic death . Here we show that IM and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) inhibitor RAD001 ( DB01590 ) have additive effects on P11274 - P00519 -expressing cells . Those effects are at least partly conditional upon the enhanced nuclear accumulation of p145 c- P00519 through events encompassing post-translational modifications of p145 c- P00519 ( DB00156 (735) phosphorylation ) precluding its nuclear export and of 14-3-3 sigma ( DB00133 (186) phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase [ JNK ] ) promoting p145 c- P00519 nuclear re-import . Steady-state kinetic and inhibition studies of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) kinase domain and P42345 complexes . The mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) is a DB00133 / DB00156 protein kinase and a major controller of cell growth . In cells , P42345 forms two distinct multiprotein complexes , mTORC1 and mTORC2 . The mTORC1 complex can phosphorylate 4EBP1 and P23443 , two key regulators of translation initiation , whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates P31749 , an event required for P31749 activation . Here , we expressed and purified human mTORC1 and mTORC2 from P29320 -293 cells using FLAG-M2 affinity chromatography . Western blotting analysis using phospho-specific antibodies indicated that recombinant mTORC1 and mTORC2 exhibit distinct substrate preferences in vitro , consistent with their roles in cells . To improve our understanding of the enzymatic properties of P42345 alone and P42345 in its complex form , steady-state kinetic profiles of truncated P42345 containing the kinase domain ( residues 1360-2549 ) and mTORC1 were determined . The results revealed that mTORC1 is catalytically less active than truncated P42345 , as evidenced by 4.7- and 3.1-fold decreases in catalytic efficiency , k(cat)/K(m) , for DB00171 and 4EBP1 , respectively . We also found that truncated P42345 undergoes autophosphorylation through an intramolecular mechanism . Mass spectrometric analysis identified two novel P42345 autophosphorylation sites , Ser2454 and either Thr2473 or Thr2474 , in addition to the previously reported Ser2481 site . Truncated P42345 and mTORC1 were completely inhibited by DB00171 competitive inhibitors PI103 and BEZ235 and partially inhibited by rapamycin/ P62942 in a noncompetitive fashion toward DB00171 . All inhibitors tested exhibited similar inhibitory potencies between mTORC1 and truncated P42345 containing the kinase domain . Our studies presented here provide the first detailed kinetic studies of a recombinant P42345 complex . Effective motion-sensitizing magnetization preparation for black blood magnetic resonance imaging of the heart . PURPOSE : To investigate the effectiveness of flow signal suppression of a motion-sensitizing magnetization preparation ( MSPREP ) sequence and to optimize a 2D MSPREP steady-state free precession ( SSFP ) sequence for black blood imaging of the heart . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Using a flow phantom , the effect of varying field of speed ( P01100 ) , b-value , voxel size , and flow pattern on the flow suppression was investigated . In seven healthy volunteers , black blood images of the heart were obtained at 1.5T with MSPREP-SSFP and double inversion recovery fast spin echo ( P30518 -FSE ) techniques . Myocardium and blood signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) and myocardium-to-blood contrast-to-noise ratio ( P21554 ) were measured . The optimal P01100 that maximized the P21554 for MSPREP-SSFP was determined . RESULTS : Phantom data demonstrated that the flow suppression was induced primarily by the velocity encoding effect . In humans , P01100 =10-20 cm/s was found to maximize the P21554 for short-axis ( SA ) and four-chamber ( 4C ) views . Compared to P30518 -FSE , MSPREP-SSFP provided similar blood SNR efficiency in the SA basal and mid-views and significantly lower blood SNR efficiency in the SA apical ( P=0.02 ) and 4C ( P=0.01 ) views , indicating similar or better blood suppression . CONCLUSION : Velocity encoding is the primary flow suppression mechanism of the MSPREP sequence and 2D MSPREP-SSFP black blood imaging of the heart is feasible in healthy subjects . Transformed 3T3 cells have reduced levels and altered subcellular distribution of the major PKC substrate protein P29966 . The P29966 ( myristylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate ) protein is an abundant calmodulin-binding protein that is a major and specific endogenous substrate of protein kinase C ( PKC ) . Stimulation of cells with phorbol esters or other activators of PKC has been shown previously to result in rapid phosphorylation of P29966 proteins and redistribution of these myristylated C-kinase substrates from membrane to cytosol . Here we show that NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts transformed by P38936 -HA-C- DB01367 or pp60-V- P12931 oncoproteins have markedly reduced levels of p68- P29966 and that most of the remaining P29966 protein is found in the cytosol . 3T3 cells containing a nontransforming oncoprotein Q9Y3Q3 - P10415 , in contrast , exhibited normal levels and distribution of p68- P29966 . When taken together with recent evidence that P29966 proteins are involved in regulating organization of the membrane cytoskeleton , our findings suggest that oncoprotein-mediated alterations in P29966 protein levels and subcellular distribution may contribute to the development or maintenance of the transformed phenotype . Repression of P10415 by the tumor suppressor activity of the lysyl oxidase propeptide inhibits transformed phenotype of lung and pancreatic cancer cells . The gene encoding lysyl oxidase ( P28300 ) was identified as the ras recision gene ( rrg ) , with the ability to revert Ras-mediated transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts . Mutations in DB01367 genes have been found in approximately 25 % of lung cancers and in 85 % of pancreatic cancers . In microarray analysis , these cancers were found to display reduced P28300 gene expression . Thus , the ability of the P28300 gene to repress the transformed phenotype of these cancer cells was tested . P28300 is synthesized as a 50-kDa secreted precursor Pro- P28300 that is processed to the 32-kDa active enzyme ( P28300 ) and to an 18-kDa propeptide ( P28300 -PP ) . Recently , we mapped the rrg activity of Pro- P28300 to the P28300 -PP in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells . Ectopic Pro- P28300 and P28300 -PP expression in H1299 lung cancer cells inhibited growth in soft agar and invasive colony formation in Matrigel and reduced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) and Akt , with P28300 -PP showing substantially higher activity . Similarly , P28300 -PP expression in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells effectively reduced P29323 and Akt activity and inhibited growth in soft agar and ability of these cells to migrate . Nuclear Factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and its target gene P10415 , which are overexpressed in 70 % to 75 % of pancreatic cancers , have recently been implicated in invasive phenotype . P28300 -PP substantially reduced NF-kappaB and Bcl-2 levels . Reintroduction of Bcl-2 into PANC-1 or H1299 cells expressing P28300 -PP restored the transformed phenotype , suggesting that Bcl-2 is an essential target . Thus , P28300 -PP potently inhibits invasive phenotype of lung and pancreatic cancer cells , suggesting potential therapeutic applications in treatment of these cancers . Gene network profiling before and after transplantation in alcoholic cirrhosis liver transplant recipients . The main objective of this study was to define a gene network profile network in liver transplant recipients with alcoholic cirrhosis before and after liver transplantation . Genes were selected from data obtained in a previous study of liver transplant recipients with alcoholic cirrhosis . Selected up-regulated genes were further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in different groups of liver transplant recipients with alcoholic cirrhosis ( n=5 ) . Selected genes up-regulated before transplantation were : Q07011 ( tumor necrosis factor [ P01375 ] receptor superfamily , member 9 ) ; P14784 ( interleukin-2 receptor beta ) ; Q92843 ( P10415 -like 2 ) ; Q96PH1 ( NADPH ) oxidase , EF-hand calcium binding domain 5 ) ; P50542 ( peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 ) ; P37231 ( peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ) ; Q96Q05 ( O14920 binding protein ) ; Q9NYR9 ( NFKappaBeta inhibitor interacting Ras-like 2 ) ; P05112 ( interleukin-4 ) ; IL-4R ( interleukin 4 receptor ) ; P07327 ( alcohol dehydrogenase 1A , class 1 ) ; O75891 ( aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family , member Q9NUQ9 ) ; P05164 ( myeloperoxidase ) ; P01160 ( natriuretic peptide precursor A ) ; Q16548 ( P10415 -related protein A1 ) ; P24522 ( growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible alpha ) ; P55061 ( P55061 ) ; P42336 ( phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ) ; P38484 ( interferon gamma receptor 2 ) ; O60674 ( Janus Kinase 2 ) ; FAS ( Fas , P01375 receptor superfamily , member 6 ) ; Q92844 ( TRAF family member-associated NFKB activator ) ; O95551 ( O95551 ) ; and P08758 ( annexin A5 ) . P01236 activates mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and corticotropin releasing hormone transcription in rat hypothalamic neurons . P01236 ( PRL ) modulates maternal behavior and mediates hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis inhibition during lactation via PRL receptors in the brain . To identify mechanisms mediating these effects , we examined the effects of PRL on signaling and P06850 transcription in hypothalamic neurons in vivo and in vitro . Western blot of hypothalamic proteins from rats receiving intracerebroventricular PRL injection revealed increases in phosphorylation of the MAPK and P29323 . Double-staining immunohistochemistry demonstrated phosphorylated P29323 localization in parvocellular P06850 neurons as well as magnocellular vasopressin and oxytocin neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular ( PVN ) and supraoptic nuclei . PRL also induced P29323 phosphorylation in vitro in the hypothalamic cell line , 4B , which expresses PRL receptors , and in primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures . Using reporter gene assays in 4B cells , or quantitative RT-PCR for primary transcript in hypothalamic cell cultures , PRL potentiated forskolin-stimulated P06850 transcription through activation of the P29323 /MAPK pathway . The effect of PRL in hypothalamic cell cultures was unaffected by tetrodotoxin , suggesting a direct effect on P06850 neurons . The data show that PRL activates the P29323 /MAPK pathway and facilitates P06850 transcription in P06850 neurons , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of PRL on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity reported in vivo is indirect and probably mediated through modulation of afferent pathways to the PVN . In addition , the prominent stimulatory action of PRL on the P29323 /MAPK pathway in the hypothalamic PVN and supraoptic nucleus is likely to mediate neuroplasticity of the neuroendocrine system during lactation . Targets of transcriptional regulation by two distinct type I receptors for transforming growth factor-beta in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) plays a crucial role in vascular development and homeostasis by regulating many transcriptional targets . P36897 ( P36897 ) is a P36897 expressed in various TGF-beta-responsive cells . In contrast , P37023 functions as a P36897 in endothelial cells , and is responsible for human hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( DB04865 ) type II . P36897 and P37023 mediate TGF-beta signals through distinct Smad proteins , i.e. , Q15796 / P84022 and Q15797 / Q99717 , respectively . To identify target genes of P37023 and P36897 in endothelial cells , we conducted oligonucleotide microarray analysis . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) were infected with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a constitutively active form of P37023 or P36897 . P36897 inhibited the proliferation , network formation , and tube formation of HUVEC and induced their apoptosis , whereas P37023 did not exhibit significant effects on HUVEC in vitro . mRNAs were extracted from HUVEC and used for hybridization of oligonucleotide arrays representing approximately 7,000 human genes . Northern blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analyses were also performed for some of these genes , confirming the validity of this microarray analysis . We found that P37023 specifically upregulated O43541 , O15105 , Id1 , Id2 , endoglin , P42224 , and interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 . P36897 , in contrast , upregulated P49763 , SM22alpha , connexin 37 , betaIG-H3 , and Q14766 . P37023 downregulated Q15797 , P61073 , P20827 , and plakoglobin , whereas P36897 downregulated claudin 5 and integrin beta(5) . These results revealed some new targets of TGF-beta in endothelial cells , and differences in transcriptional regulation patterns between P37023 and P36897 . DB04868 : a phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative with activity against P11274 - P00519 , P10721 and P09619 kinases . The P11274 - P00519 kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is currently the standard therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . However , mutations within the P00519 kinase domain interfering with drug binding have been identified as the main mechanism of resistance to imatinib . Multiple distinct P11274 - P00519 kinase mutant isoforms conferring varying degrees of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been reported . DB04868 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor 30-fold more potent than imatinib against P11274 - P00519 kinase . DB04868 is active against a wide range of imatinib-resistant P11274 - P00519 mutant isoforms , except for T315I . Results from Phase II studies of nilotinib for patients with CML after failure or intolerance to imatinib therapy have shown a favorable toxicity profile and confirmed the high efficacy of nilotinib in this setting . Studies addressing the activity of nilotinib in newly-diagnosed patients with CML are underway . Furthermore , nilotinib is a potent inhibitor of P10721 and P09619 kinases . Here , we review the preclinical development of nilotinib and the activity of this agent in patients with CML and in tumors driven by P10721 and/or P09619 mutant kinases , such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors and some forms of clonal hypereosinophilia . cDNA array analysis of cytobrush-collected normal and malignant cervical epithelial cells : a feasibility study . Analysis of gene expression pattern is a useful approach to evaluating the biological behavior and clinical outcome of several human malignancies . Differentially expressed genes in malignant squamous cervical cells and the feasibility of gene expression profiling on squamous cervical cells obtained from cervical swabs were investigated . Cervical squamous cells from three women with high-risk human papilloma virus ( HR-HPV ) positive invasive squamous cervical carcinoma and from three HPV-negative women with normal ectocervical smears were analyzed with cDNA array . Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect the proteins corresponding to the highest upregulated genes with cDNA array . mRNA expression of P04626 , P10721 , P17948 , P04198 , DB01367 , CDKN2A , P24385 , P15531 , P22392 , MET , P21781 , P21802 , and P42224 was increased in malignant samples . Several expressed genes associated with antiapoptosis ( such as P10415 ) , cell structuring , or cell attachment were also upregulated in carcinoma cells . Decreased gene expression was observed for members of the transforming growth factor receptor superfamily ( TGF ) and integrin family , interleukin 1 ( IL1 ) , and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) . This study shows the feasibility of gene expression profiling of cervical squamous cells obtained with cytobrushes by identifying a characteristic gene expression pattern that clearly distinguishes between malignant and normal cervical epithelia of squamous type . We hypothesize that this noninvasive technique could be used in the evaluation of ambiguous Papanicolaou ( PAP ) smears . Simultaneous inhibition of MEK and P11802 leads to potent apoptosis in human melanoma cells . ABSTRACT Deregulation of DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 and P42771 -cycylin D: P11802 /6-RB pathways is important for melanoma development . Chemotherapeutic agents targeting both pathways were developed but results of clinical studies with monotherapies were disappointing . We examined the effect of co-targeting both pathways with MEK inhibitor PD98059 and P11802 inhibitor 219476 on human melanoma cells lines , and found that combinatorial treatment dramatically increased apoptosis compared to the single agent treatment . The apoptosis was associated with downregulation of P10415 , Q07817 , O15392 , and upregulation of O43521 . Our results indicate that simultaneously targeting P29323 and RB pathways is a promising strategy for melanoma treatment and should encourage further in-depth investigations . miRNA-regulated expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the cisplatin-inhibited growth of K562 cells . To explore the mechanism of apoptosis induced by cisplatin , the expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) and regulating genes in K562 cells was analyzed using reverse transcription PCR , quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays . Our results showed that miR-16 , miR-34a-c , miR-17-5p and miR-125 were up-regulated , and their associated oncogenes ( P10415 , Q01094 and O00716 , respectively ) were down-regulated after cisplatin treatment . We also showed that miR-106 and miR-150 were down-regulated while their target genes ( P06400 and P04637 , respectively ) were up-regulated after cisplatin treatment . Moreover , miR-16 , miR-34a-c and miR-17-5p proved to be upstream factors , regulating the expression of P10415 , Q01094 and O00716 , respectively . The oncogene O00716 was down-regulated when P06400 expression was increased after treatment with antisense oligonucleotides ( ASO ) . Similarly , P10415 and O00716 were down-regulated when P04637 expression was elevated by ASO treatment . The study demonstrated that cisplatin induces K562 cells to apoptosis by reducing miR-106 which up-regulates P06400 or by inhibiting miR-150 which increases P04637 expression . The calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling pathway mediates the effect of corticotropin releasing factor and urocortins on catecholamine synthesis . The biological effects of the P06850 ( CRF ) family of neuropeptides are mediated by mobilization of [ Ca(2+) ] . Aim of the current work was to examine if the calcineurin/NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T-cells ) signaling pathway is involved in the effect of CRF peptides in catecholamine synthesis and secretion from PC12 rat pheochromocytona cells , a model for the study of adrenal catecholamine production . PC12 cells express both types of CRF receptors . Our data are as follows : ( a ) The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) blocked norepinephrine secretion induced by ligands of either CRF type 1 ( CRF(1) ) or 2 ( CRF(2) ) receptors on PC12 cells . ( b ) Silencing O95644 expression using a selective O95644 siRNA blocked CRF(1) and CRF(2) -induced NE production . ( c ) CRF ligands induced NFAT transcriptional activity in cells transfected with a luciferase reporter construct controlled by NFAT binding elements ( NFAT-Luc ) . ( d ) DB00091 completely blocked the stimulatory effect of CRF(1) and CRF(2) ligands on NFAT activity in NFAT-Luc transfected cells . ( e ) PKA , PKC , p38-MAPK , Tpl2 , P01112 , and P31749 were crucial intermediates for both CRF(1) and CRF(2)-induced NFAT activation . Interestingly , Q02750 /2 and P27361 /2 were crucial only for the CRF(2)-induced NFAT activation . ( f ) p38-MAPK and Tpl2 were crucial intermediates for both CRF(1) and CRF(2)-induced norepinephrine production , while P31749 affected only CRF(2)-induced norepinephrine production . In conclusion , our data suggest that CRF(1) and CRF(2) ligands activate the transcription factor NFAT and its activation is prerequisite for CRF-induced catecholamine production from chromaffin cells . DB00104 -targeted liposomes loaded with CPT-11 enhanced cytotoxicity for the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma . Medullary thyroid carcinoma ( P04629 ) is a rare endocrine tumor that frequently metastasizes , but treatment with irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) is limited because of side effects . P04629 is known to overexpress the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ( P30874 ) . DB00104 ( Oct ) is a somatostatin analogue that has a high binding affinity for SSTR and can be used as a tumor-targeting ligand . We prepared Oct-targeted liposomes loaded with CPT-11 using Oct-poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) -lipid and evaluated Oct-mediated association and cytotoxicity of the liposomes with an P04629 cell line TT . The association of higher concentrations of modified Oct-targeted liposomes with TT cells was significantly higher than PEGylated liposomes and was significantly inhibited by empty Oct-targeted liposomes but not by free Oct . With exposure for 96 h , the cytotoxicity of Oct-targeted liposomal CPT-11 ( IC50 : 1.05 ± 0.47 μM ) was higher than free CPT-11 ( IC50 : 3.76 ± 0.61 μM ) or PEGylated liposomal CPT-11 ( IC50 : 3.05 ± 0.28 μM ) . In addition , empty Oct-targeted liposomes showed significantly higher cytotoxicity than empty nontargeted liposomes at a concentration where free Oct did not show cytotoxicity , suggesting that Oct as a ligand showed cytotoxicity . Moreover , Oct-targeted liposomal CPT-11 led to significantly higher antitumor activity and prolonged the survival time compared with nontargeted liposomal and free CPT-11 at a one-third dose and lower administration times with free CPT-11 . These findings indicated that Oct-targeted liposomes loaded with CPT-11 may offer considerable potential for P04629 chemotherapy because cytotoxicity of both CPT-11 and Oct was enhanced by effective cellular uptake via P30874 . BMP receptor-integrin interaction mediates responses of vascular endothelial Q15797 /5 and proliferation to disturbed flow . BACKGROUND : Vascular endothelial cells ( ECs ) are constantly exposed to blood flow-induced shear stress . Our previous study demonstrated that disturbed flow with low and oscillatory shear stress ( OSS ) induces bone morphogenetic protein receptor ( BMPR ) -specific Q15797 /5 activation in ECs , but the underlying mechanisms and the in vivo functional role of Q15797 /5 remain unclear . OBJECTIVES : Here we elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which OSS activates EC Q15797 /5 and its in vivo functional role . METHODS : Lentiviral Q99717 -specific short hairpin RNA ( Lenti-shSmad5 ) was constructed and intra-arterially injected into the lumen of stenosed abdominal aorta in bromodeoxyuridine-infused rats . Co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assays were performed on ECs exposed to OSS ( 0.5 ± 4 dynes/cm(2) ) in a parallel-plate flow chamber to investigate BMPR-integrin interactions and their regulatory role in OSS-activation of EC Q15797 /5 . RESULTS : Intra-arterial administration of Lenti-shSmad5 inhibited bromodeoxyuridine uptake of ECs at post-stenotic sites , where disturbed flow with OSS occurs . OSS induced sustained BMPRIB-αv β3 integrin association in ECs , which was mediated by the intracytoplasmic kinase domain of BMPRII and subsequently activated the Shc/focal adhesion kinase ( Q05397 ) /extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) cascade , leading to Q15797 /5 activation . This OSS-activation of Q15797 /5 induced its association with and activation of runt-related transcription factor-2 ( Runx2 ) , leading to activations of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) and p70S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) , a pathway critical for EC proliferation in response to OSS . CONCLUSIONS : Oscillatory shear stress induces synergistic interactions between specific BMPRs and integrin to activate Q15797 /5 through the Shc/ Q05397 / P29323 pathway , which leads to the activation of the Runx2/ P42345 /p70S6K pathway to promote EC proliferation . P10275 rediscovered : the new biology and targeting the androgen receptor therapeutically . Discoveries over the past decade suggest that castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) is sensitive , but not resistant to , further manipulation of the androgen-androgen receptor ( AR ) axis . Several new therapies that target this axis have demonstrated clinical activity . In this article , preclinical and clinical findings occurring in the field of AR-targeted therapies are reviewed . Reviews of scientific and clinical development are divided into those occurring prereceptor ( androgen production and conversion ) and at the level of the receptor ( AR aberrations and therapies targeting AR directly ) . Intracrine androgen production and AR amplification , among others , are among the principal aberrancies driving CRPC growth . Phase III data with abiraterone acetate and phase II data with DB08899 , along with other similar therapies , confirm for the clinician that the scientific findings related to persistent AR signaling in a castrate milieu can be harnessed to produce significant clinical benefit for patients with the disease . Studies aimed at optimizing the timing of their use and exploring the mechanisms of resistance to these therapies are under way . The clinical success of therapies that directly target androgen synthesis as well as the most common aberrancies of the AR confirm that prostate cancer retains dependence on AR signaling , even in the castrate state . Reactive oxygen species , DNA damage , and error-prone repair : a model for genomic instability with progression in myeloid leukemia ? Myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis , with an increased propensity to develop acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) . The molecular basis for P43034 progression is unknown , but a key element in P43034 disease progression is loss of chromosomal material ( genomic instability ) . Using our two-step mouse model for myeloid leukemic disease progression involving overexpression of human mutant P01111 and P10415 genes , we show that there is a stepwise increase in the frequency of DNA damage leading to an increased frequency of error-prone repair of double-strand breaks ( DSB ) by nonhomologous end-joining . There is a concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in these transgenic mice with disease progression . Importantly , P63000 , an essential component of the ROS-producing NADPH oxidase , is downstream of DB01367 , and we show that ROS production in P01111 / P10415 mice is in part dependent on P63000 activity . DNA damage and error-prone repair can be decreased or reversed in vivo by N-acetyl cysteine antioxidant treatment . Our data link gene abnormalities to constitutive DNA damage and increased DSB repair errors in vivo and provide a mechanism for an increase in the error rate of DNA repair with P43034 disease progression . These data suggest treatment strategies that target DB01367 / P31749 pathways and ROS production in human P43034 /AML . P62942 , the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein , is a physiologic regulator of the cell cycle . P62942 , the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein , is a ubiquitous abundant protein that acts as a receptor for the immunosuppressant drug FK506 , binds tightly to intracellular calcium release channels and to the transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) type I receptor . We now demonstrate that cells from P62942 -deficient ( P62942 (-/-) ) mice manifest cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase and that these cells can be rescued by P62942 transfection . This arrest is mediated by marked augmentation of P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) levels , which can not be further augmented by TGF-beta1 . The P38936 up-regulation and cell cycle arrest derive from the overactivity of TGF-beta receptor signaling , which is normally inhibited by P62942 . Cell cycle arrest is prevented by transfection with a dominant-negative TGF-beta receptor construct . TGF-beta receptor signaling to gene expression can be mediated by SMAD , p38 , and P29323 / Q96HU1 kinase ( extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase ) pathways . SMAD signaling is down-regulated in P62942 (-/-) cells . Inhibition of P29323 / Q96HU1 kinase fails to affect P38936 up-regulation . By contrast , activated phosphorylated p38 is markedly augmented in P62942 (-/-) cells and the P38936 up-regulation is prevented by an inhibitor of p38 . Thus , P62942 is a physiologic regulator of cell cycle acting by normally down-regulating TGF-beta receptor signaling . Q96RP3 is expressed in human pregnant myometrial cells and regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation : potential role of the type-2 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor in the control of myometrial contractility . The family of P06850 -related peptides are suggested to play important roles in the control of myometrial contractility during pregnancy and labor . In this study we investigated the expression of urocortin II ( P55089 II ) in human myometrium and its ability to phosphorylate intracellular components that can be involved in modulating myometrial contractility . Using RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization , we demonstrated that P55089 II and type-2 P06850 receptor ( Q13324 ) mRNAs were expressed in human nonpregnant and pregnant myometrium . Immunofluorescent studies confirmed protein expression of P55089 II in human pregnant myometrial cells , whereas chemical cross-linking studies with radiolabeled P55089 II confirmed the presence of Q13324 sites with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa . Treatment of primary human myometrial cells with P55089 II to specifically activate Q13324 resulted in a dose-dependent increase of myosin light chain ( MLC(20) ) phosphorylation . Activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and P27361 /2 was required for the P55089 II-induced activation of MLC(20) , because treatment of myometrial cells with inhibitors of MAPK kinase 1 ( U0126 ) and PKC ( bisindolylmaleimide ) inhibited the P55089 II-induced phosphorylation of MLC(20) . Furthermore , the P55089 II effect on MLC(20) was dependent on RhoA translocation to the membrane and subsequent activation of RhoA-associated kinase , as shown by the use of the specific inhibitors exoenzyme P01024 and Y27632 . Collectively , our data suggest a distinctive role for Q13324 - specific agonists like P55089 II in the control of myometrial contractility during human pregnancy involving sequential activation of PKC , MAPK kinase 1 , P27361 /2 , RhoA , and RhoA-associated kinase , leading to the MLC(20) phosphorylation . The role of tumor suppressor dysregulation in prostate cancer progression . P10275 activity is essential for prostate cancer development and progression . While there are classically defined roles for the retinoblastoma ( P06400 ) and p53 tumor suppressor pathways in maintenance of cell cycle control and the DNA damage response , recent studies have demonstrated a direct role of these two pathways in regulating AR expression and function . While the role of Pten deregulation in prostate cancer has provided much insight in to the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer initiation and progression , emerging roles for P06400 and p53 are likely to further expand upon our understanding of tumor suppressor/nuclear receptor interaction . As disconnecting mitogenic signaling from AR-mediated gene transcription underlies the progression to castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , functional inactivation of these two tumor suppressor pathways represents one mechanism through which AR protein levels can be upregulated and AR-mediated gene transcription can become aberrant . Importantly , recent advances in small molecule inhibitor design and discovery have led to the identification of agents capable of targeting these two prominent pathways and restoring the function of deregulated wild-type P06400 and p53 protein . While such agents have undergone extensive study in many solid tumor types , the additional importance of P06400 and p53 in restraining transcription of the AR gene within the prostate provides impetus for examining how loss of these two tumor suppressor proteins can facilitate transition of prostate cancers to CRPC . As will be reviewed in this article , restoration of P06400 and p53 functions are not only important in regard to shortterm cell cycle regulation and response to genomic stresses , but likely have direct implications for deregulation of the AR locus . The bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway is upregulated in a mouse model of total parenteral nutrition . Total parenteral nutrition ( O15533 ) results in intestinal mucosal atrophic changes due to an absence of enteral nutrition ; however , the mechanisms responsible for this are not fully understood . It has been shown that bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) activation inhibits intestinal epithelial cell ( EC ) proliferation . Therefore , we hypothesized that the BMP pathway could be upregulated by O15533 . To address this , we randomly assigned mice to receive O15533 or to be enterally fed ( control ) for 7 d . Mucosal EC isolates were harvested from the entire length of small intestine for RNA and protein measurements . Q8N1N2 -thickness , mid-small bowel was processed for histological examination . O15533 increased the abundance of P12643 , P12644 , and Q13873 at the RNA and protein levels . Phosphorylation of Q15797 , Q99717 , and Smad8 also was greater in the O15533 group than in the control , which helped to confirm activation of this pathway . Interestingly , the O15533 and control groups did not differ in the mRNA expression of the extracellular soluble bmp antagonists , noggin , gremlin , chordin , or follistatin . Compared to the control group , the expression of c-Myc ( cellular myelocytomatosis ) mRNA was lower , whereas the level of P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) was greater , in the O15533 group . Because the BMP family may function through suppression of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling , this pathway was also examined . mRNA expression of Wnt 3 , Wnt5a , and the Wnt receptor Lrp5 were lower in the O15533 group compared to controls . The results suggest that the BMP signaling pathway may be involved in the development of intestinal mucosal atrophy due to O15533 administration . P10275 -induced tumor suppressor , B2CW77 , inhibits breast cancer growth and transcriptionally activates p53/p73-mediated apoptosis in breast carcinomas . P10275 ( AR ) expression by immunohistochemistry correlates with better prognosis and survival among breast cancer patients . We and others have shown that AR inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells . However , the mechanism of AR 's anti-tumor effect in breast cancer is still not fully understood . Our recent study indicates that AR upregulates expression of tumor suppressor gene P60484 by promoter activation in breast cancer . B2CW77 , encoding B2CW77 protein , is a newly identified gene , which shares a bidirectional promoter with P60484 and is transcribed in the opposite direction . So far , the function of B2CW77 has never been studied in tumorigenesis . Here , we define B2CW77 as a tumor suppressor in breast carcinomas , which inhibits tumor growth and invasiveness . After analyzing 188 normal breast and 1247 malignant breast cancer tissues , we observed the loss of B2CW77 in multiple breast cancer subtypes and this decreased B2CW77 expression associates with tumor progression and increasing histological grade in invasive carcinomas . We characterize B2CW77 , for the first time , as a transcription factor , directly promoting the expression of P04637 and O15350 , with consequent elevated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells . We demonstrate , in vitro and in murine xenograph models , that both B2CW77 and P60484 are AR-target genes , mediating androgen-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in breast cancer cells . Our observations suggest that B2CW77 might be used as a potential prognostic marker and novel therapy target for breast carcinomas . Genotoxicity and induction of DNA damage responsive genes by food-borne heterocyclic aromatic amines in human hepatoma HepG2 cells . Heterocyclic aromatic amines ( HAAs ) are potential human carcinogens formed in well-done meats and fish . The most abundant are 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP ) , 2-Amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline ( MeIQx ) , 2-Amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline ( 4,8-DiMeIQx ) and 2-Amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline ( IQ ) . HAAs exert genotoxic activity after metabolic transformation by CYP1A enzymes , that is well characterized , however the genomic and intervening responses are not well explored . We have examined cellular and genomic responses of human hepatoma HepG2 cells after 24h exposure to HAAs . Comet assay revealed increase in formation of DNA strand breaks by PhIP , MeIQx and IQ but not 4,8-DiMeIQx , whereas increased formation of micronuclei was not observed . The four HAAs up-regulated expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes P04798 , P05177 and P22309 and expression of P04637 and its downstream regulated genes P38936 , GADD45α and Q07812 . Consistent with the up-regulation of P38936 and GADD45α the cell-cycle analysis showed arrest in S-phase by PhIP and IQ , and in P55008 -phase by 4,8-DiMeIQx and MeIQx . The results indicate that upon exposure to HAAs the cells respond with the cell-cycle arrest , which enables cells to repair the damage or eliminate them by apoptosis . However , elevated expression of P10415 and down-regulation of Q07812 may indicate that HAAs could suppress apoptosis meaning higher probability of damaged cells to survive and mutate . P42892 and β-arrestins exert spatiotemporal control of DB05875 -induced inflammatory signals . Although the intracellular trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors controls specific signaling events , it is unclear how the spatiotemporal control of signaling contributes to complex pathophysiological processes such as inflammation . By using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and superresolution microscopy , we found that DB05875 ( SP ) induces the association of the neurokinin 1 receptor ( P25103 ) with two classes of proteins that regulate SP signaling from plasma and endosomal membranes : the scaffolding proteins β-arrestin ( βARRs ) 1 and 2 and the transmembrane metallopeptidases ECE-1c and ECE-1d . In HEK293 cells and non-transformed human colonocytes , we observed that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and β P49407 /2 terminate plasma membrane Ca(2+) signaling and initiate receptor trafficking to endosomes that is necessary for sustained activation of ERKs in the nucleus . βARRs deliver the SP- P25103 endosomes , where P42892 associates with the complex , degrades SP , and allows the P25103 , freed from βARRs , to recycle . Thus , both P42892 and βARRs mediate the resensitization of P25103 Ca(2+) signaling at the plasma membrane . Sustained exposure of colonocytes to SP activates NF-κB and stimulates P10145 secretion . This proinflammatory signaling is unaffected by inhibition of the endosomal P29323 pathway but is suppressed by P42892 inhibition or β P32121 knockdown . Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A , which also contributes to sustained P25103 signaling at the plasma membrane , similarly attenuates P10145 secretion . Thus , the primary function of βARRs and P42892 in SP-dependent inflammatory signaling is to promote resensitization , which allows the sustained P25103 signaling from the plasma membrane that drives inflammation . Induction of apoptosis by a dominant negative H- DB01367 mutant ( 116Y ) in K562 cells . Recent extensive work on apoptosis has begun to reveal its molecular mechanisms . Several genes that regulate apoptosis have been identified . Among them , the P10415 gene is considered to be an important gene that inhibits apoptosis . However , there must be other genes , yet to be identified , which suppress apoptosis . It has been suggested that the activation of DB01367 function by P11274 - P00519 fusion protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia may be an important mechanism in the P11274 - P00519 mediated transformation . Therefore , in this study we have investigated whether the suppression of endogenous H- DB01367 function inhibits the P11274 - P00519 mediated transforming activity in a K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line . The induced expression of a dominant negative v-H- DB01367 mutant ( 116Y ) in K562 cells has resulted in cell death . The morphological characteristics and the detection of fragmented DNA by gel electrophoresis in the dead cells have revealed that this cell death is apoptosis . These results directly indicate that the DB01367 gene as well as the P10415 gene has an ability to suppress apoptosis . Dysregulated P04629 signalling is a therapeutic target in Q9NQC7 defective tumours . Individuals with germline mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene Q9NQC7 are at high risk of developing disfiguring cutaneous appendageal tumours , the defining tumour being the highly organised cylindroma . Here , we analysed Q9NQC7 mutant tumour genomes by array comparative genomic hybridisation and gene expression microarray analysis . Q9NQC7 mutant tumours were characterised by an absence of copy-number aberrations apart from LOH chromosome 16q , the genomic location of the Q9NQC7 gene . Gene expression profiling of Q9NQC7 mutant tumours showed dysregulated tropomyosin kinase ( P04629 ) signalling , with overexpression of Q16620 and Q16288 in tumours when compared with perilesional skin . Immunohistochemical analysis of a tumour microarray showed strong membranous Q16620 and Q16288 staining in cylindromas , as well as elevated levels of P29323 phosphorylation and P10415 expression . Membranous Q16288 overexpression was also observed in 70 % of sporadic BCCs . RNA interference-mediated silencing of Q16620 and Q16288 , as well as treatment with the small-molecule P04629 inhibitor lestaurtinib , reduced colony formation and proliferation in 3D primary cell cultures established from Q9NQC7 mutant tumours . These results suggest that P04629 inhibition could be used as a strategy to treat tumours with loss of functional Q9NQC7 . P04150 antagonism disrupts the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories in rats . Reconsolidation is the process whereby consolidated memories are destabilized upon retrieval and restabilized to persist for later use . Although the neurobiology of the reconsolidation of both appetitive and aversive memories has been intensively investigated , reconsolidation of memories of physiologically relevant social rewards has received little attention . Social play , the most characteristic social behaviour displayed by young mammals , is highly rewarding , illustrated by the fact that it can induce conditioned place preference ( CPP ) . Here , we investigated the role of signalling mechanisms implicated in memory processes , including reconsolidation , namely glucocorticoid , mineralocorticoid , DB01221 glutamatergic and P21554 cannabinoid receptors , in the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP in rats . Systemic treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone before , but not immediately after , retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP . DB00834 did not affect social play-induced CPP in the absence of memory retrieval . Treatment with the DB01221 receptor antagonist MK-801 modestly affected the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP . However , the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP was not affected by treatment with the mineralocorticoid and P21554 cannabinoid receptor antagonists spironolactone and rimonabant , respectively . We conclude that glucocorticoid neurotransmission mediates the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories in rats . These data indicate that the neural mechanisms of the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories only partially overlap with those underlying the reconsolidation of other reward-related memories . An association analysis of circadian genes in anxiety disorders . BACKGROUND : The mammalian circadian system is responsible for controlling daily oscillations in physiology and behavior . Circadian genes contribute to the sleep-wake cycle and mood , and because patients with anxiety disorder often suffer from sleep disturbances , we hypothesized that variants in circadian-clock-related genes might predispose to human anxiety disorders as well . We tested this hypothesis with a genetic association analysis . METHODS : We analyzed 131 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 13 circadian-clock-related genes . The study sample consisted of 321 individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and 653 matched healthy controls from a Finnish population-based cohort . RESULTS : Single nucleotide polymorphisms in two genes showed some evidence for association to social phobia : in Q8WYA1 rs2306073 ( p = .0099 ) and in P14416 rs7131056 ( p = .0084 ) . P10415 rs12454712 ( p = .0029 ) and P14416 rs4245146 ( p = .0010 ) showed evidence for association to generalized anxiety disorder , whereas rs2463107 ( p = .0064 ) in Q96IZ0 and rs4245146 ( p = .0029 ) in P14416 showed evidence for association to the pooled group of all anxiety disorders . Findings in P14416 became stronger when only anxiety disorder cases with comorbid alcohol use disorder were considered . CONCLUSIONS : Genes contributing to circadian rhythms might also play a role in the genetic predisposition to anxiety disorders . In addition , our study provides further support for the association of P14416 to comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorder . DB02546 and bortezomib synergistically cause ubiquitinated protein accumulation in prostate cancer cells . PURPOSE : Protein ubiquitination is a novel strategy used to treat malignancies . We investigated whether the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , Michigan ) and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( LC Laboratories , Woburn , Massachusetts ) would synergistically cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in prostate cancer cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS : LNCaP , PC-3 and DU 145 cells ( ATCC™ ) were treated with vorinostat and/or bortezomib . Cell viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed . In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a murine subcutaneous tumor model using PC-3 cells . The influence of androgen receptor expression on bortezomib efficacy was examined using RNA interference . Changes in the expression of ubiquitinated proteins , cell cycle associated proteins and acetylated histone were evaluated . RESULTS : P10275 expression seemed to decrease bortezomib activity . PC-3 and DU 145 cells were more susceptible to bortezomib than LNCaP cells and the silencing of androgen receptor expression in LNCaP cells enhanced bortezomib activity . DB02546 and bortezomib synergistically induced apoptosis , inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and suppressed tumor growth in a murine xenograft model . The combination decreased cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression , and increased P38936 expression . The combination synergistically caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and histone acetylation . This histone acetylation was a consequence of the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins . CONCLUSIONS : DB02546 and bortezomib inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells synergistically by causing ubiquitinated proteins to accumulate in cells . The current study provides a framework for testing the combination in patients with advanced prostate cancer . Targeting eIF4GI translation initiation factor affords an attractive therapeutic strategy in multiple myeloma . BACKGROUND : Deregulation of protein synthesis is integral to the malignant phenotype and translation initiation is the rate limiting stage . Therefore , eIF4F translation initiation complex components are attractive therapeutic targets . METHODS : Protein lysates of myeloma cells ( cell lines/patients ' bone marrow samples ) untreated/treated with bevacizumab were assayed for eIF4GI expression , regulation ( P15559 /proteosome dependent fragmentation ) ( WB , DB00266 , qPCR ) and targets (WB). eIF4GI was inhibited by knockdown and 4EGI-1 . Cells were tested for viability ( ELISA ) , death ( FACS ) and eIF4GI targets ( WB ) . RESULTS : Previously , we have shown that manipulation of P15692 in myeloma cells attenuated P06730 dependent translation initiation . Here we assessed the significance of eIF4GI to MM cells . We demonstrated increased expression of eIF4GI in myeloma cells and its attenuation upon P15692 inhibition attributed to elevated P15559 /proteasome dependent fragmentation and diminished mRNA levels . Knockdown of eIF4GI was deleterious to myeloma cells phenotype and expression of specific molecular targets ( Q99717 /ERα/HIF1α/c-Myc ) . Finally , we showed that the small molecule 4EGI-1 inhibits eIF4GI and causes a reduction in expression of its molecular targets in myeloma . CONCLUSION : Our findings substantiate that translation initiation of particular targets in MM is contingent on the function of eIF4GI , critical to cell phenotype , and mark it as a viable target for pharmacological intervention . AM251 induces apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in A375 human melanoma cells . Human cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant type of cancer . AM251 is a cannabinoid type 1 ( P21554 ) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist with off-target antitumor activity against pancreatic and colon cancer cells . The current study aimed to characterize the in-vitro antimelanoma activity of AM251 . The P15056 V600E mutant melanoma cell line , A375 , was used as an in-vitro model system . Characterization tools included a cell viability assay , nuclear morphology assessment , gene expression , western blot , flow cytometry with P08758 -FITC/7-AAD double staining , cell cycle analyses , and measurements of changes in intracellular DB02527 and calcium concentrations . AM251 exerted a marked cytotoxic effect against A375 human melanoma cells with potency comparable with that observed for cisplatin without significant changes in the human dermal fibroblasts viability . AM251 , at a concentration that approximates the IC50 , downregulated genes encoding antiapoptotic proteins ( P10415 and survivin ) and increased transcription levels of proapoptotic Q07812 , induced alteration of P08758 reactivity , DNA fragmentation , chromatin condensation in the cell nuclei , and G2/M phase arrest.AM251 also induced a 40 % increase in the basal DB02527 levels , but it did not affect intracellular calcium concentrations . The involvement of Q9Y2T6 , O75762 , and P35354 in the AM251 mechanism of action was excluded . The combination of AM251 with celecoxib produced a synergistic antitumor activity , although the mechanism underlying this effect remains to be elucidated . This study provides the first evidence of a proapoptotic effect and G2/M cell cycle arrest of AM251 on A375 cells . This compound may be a potential prototype for the development of promising diarylpyrazole derivatives to be evaluated in human cutaneous melanoma . Molecular pathways : the basis for rational combination using MEK inhibitors in P01116 -mutant cancers . Mutations in DB01367 oncogenes are frequently observed in human cancers , and the mutations result in activation of the DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway , leading to cell proliferation and survival . The pathway is , therefore , a potent therapeutic target in the DB01367 -mutant cancers . MEK inhibitors can specifically block the pathway and are one of the key types of drugs for the treatment of the DB01367 -mutant cancers . As DB01367 proteins activate other downstream signaling proteins in addition to the DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway , combination therapeutic approaches with MEK inhibitors are also being evaluated . Moreover , MEK inhibitors can arrest cancer cells in P55008 phase and repress prosurvival Bcl2 family proteins such as Q07820 and P10415 /BCLXL , and increase expression of Bim , a proapoptotic BH3-only family protein . This mechanism may explain the efficacy of the combination of MEK inhibitors with cytotoxic agents or other targeted inhibitors . A better understanding of the pathway will help us with development of rational combinations for the treatment of the DB01367 -mutant cancers . P06401 activation of extranuclear signaling pathways in regulating p53 expression in vascular endothelial cells . We previously showed that progesterone ( P4 ) inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) through a p53-dependent pathway . Now we investigated further the molecular mechanism underlying the hormone activity . In cultured HUVECs , P4 increased the protein levels of phosphorylated Src ( p-Src ) , P04049 , and P29323 . The levels of p-Src and p-Src-progesterone receptor complex in HUVECs were increased by P4 treatment . These effects were blocked by pretreatment with a progesterone receptor antagonist , DB00834 . The P4-induced increase in p53 transactivity was abolished by pretreatment with Src kinase inhibitors . Moreover , administration with cSrc antisense oligonucleotide prevented the P4-induced increases of the levels of p53 mRNA and protein . These data suggest that P4-induced up-regulation of p53 might be mediated through activation of cSrc . Pretreatment with Src kinase inhibitors also prevented P4-induced membrane translocation of Kras and increases of the protein levels of phosphorylated Raf and phosphorylated P29323 . Transfection with dominant-negative P28482 prevented the P4-induced increases of protein level and promoter activity of p53 and a decrease of thymidine incorporation . P4 also increased nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) nuclear translocation and NF-κB binding onto the p53 promoter . These effects were abolished by pretreatment with P29323 inhibitors . The P4-induced up-regulation of the p53 promoter activity was prevented by preadministration with dominant-negative P28482 or NF-κB inhibitors . Taken together , our data suggest that the cSrc/Kras/ P04049 / P28482 /NF-κB signaling pathway contributes to the P4-induced up-regulation of p53 in HUVECs . These findings highlight progesterone receptor activation of extranuclear signaling pathways in regulating p53 and cell cycle progression in HUVECs . Generation of Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes resistant to the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus ( FK506 ) . Adoptive transfer of autologous Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( EBV-CTLs ) to solid organ transplant ( SOT ) recipients has been shown safe and effective for the treatment of EBV-associated posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLDs ) . SOT recipients , however , require the continuous administration of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent graft rejection , and these agents may significantly limit the long-term persistence of transferred EBV-CTLs , precluding their use as prophylaxis . DB00864 ( FK506 ) is one of the most widely used immunosuppressive agents in SOT recipients , and its immunosuppressive effects are largely dependent on its interaction with the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein ( P62942 ) . We have knocked down the expression of P62942 in EBV-CTLs using a specific small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) stably expressed from a retroviral vector and found that P62942 -silenced EBV-CTLs are FK506 resistant . These cells continue to expand in the presence of the drug without measurable impairment of their antigen specificity or cytotoxic activity . We confirmed their FK506 resistance and anti-PTLD activity in vivo using a xenogenic mouse model , suggesting that the proposed strategy may be of value to enhance EBV-specific immune surveillance in patients at high risk of PTLD after transplantation . The BH3 mimetic DB05764 synergizes with the Q02750 /2 inhibitor selumetinib/AZD6244 to promote O43521 -dependent tumour cell death and inhibit acquired resistance . Tumour cells typically exhibit a G(1) cell cycle arrest in response to the Q02750 /2 [ mitogen-activated protein kinase/ P29323 ( extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ) kinase 1/2 ] inhibitor selumetinib , but do not die , and thus they acquire resistance . In the present study we examined the effect of combining selumetinib with the BH3 [ P10415 ( B-cell lymphoma 2 ) homology domain 3 ] -mimetic P10415 inhibitor DB05764 . Although either drug alone caused little tumour cell death , the two agents combined to cause substantial caspase-dependent cell death and inhibit long-term clonogenic survival of colorectal cancer and melanoma cell lines with P15056 (V600E) or DB01367 mutations . This cell death absolutely required Q07812 ( P10415 -associated X protein ) and was inhibited by RNAi ( RNA interference ) -mediated knockdown of O43521 ( P10415 -interacting mediator of cell death ) in the P15056 (V600E)-positive COLO205 cell line . When colorectal cancer cell lines were treated with selumetinib plus DB05764 we observed a striking reduction in the incidence of cells emerging with acquired resistance to selumetinib . Similar results were observed when we combined DB05764 with the P15056 (V600E)-selective inhibitor PLX4720 , but only in cells expressing P15056 (V600E) . Finally , cancer cells in which acquired resistance to selumetinib arises through P15056 (V600E) amplification remained sensitive to DB05764 , whereas selumetinib-resistant HCT116 cells ( P01116 (G13D) amplification ) were cross-resistant to DB05764 . Thus the combination of a P10415 inhibitor and an P27361 /2 pathway inhibitor is synthetic lethal in P27361 /2-addicted tumour cells , delays the onset of acquired resistance and in some cases overcomes acquired resistance to selumetinib . [ Role of neurokinin-1 receptor in lung injury in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis ] . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the expression of neurokinin-1 receptor ( P25103 ) in the lung tissue , and the relationship between expression of P25103 and lung injury in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis ( P01160 ) . METHODS : One hundred and twenty adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into P01160 and control groups . Animals in group P01160 were induced by the retrograde intraductal infusion of 5 % sodium taurocholate ( 0.1 ml/kg ) , and animals in normal control group received laparotomy only . The accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in lung tissues was measured with myeloperoxidase ( P05164 ) assay . Lung endothelial barrier destruction was measured by lung capillary permeability ( LCP ) . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) was used to determine the mRNA expression of P25103 , western blot analysis was used to determine P25103 protein expression levels , and immunohistochemistry was used to localize expression site of P25103 . RESULTS : P25103 mRNA level was enhanced in the lung of P01160 compared with normal control group . Western blot analysis showed overexpression of P25103 protein level exited in P01160 group . Statistical analysis revealed correlation between P25103 mRNA and P05164 ( r=0.83 , P < 0.01 ) and LCP ( r=0.79 , P < 0.01 ) respectively . With immunohistochemistry staining , moderate to strong P25103 immunoreactivity was localized to alveolar membrane , I epithelium , II epithelium and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the lung of P01160 . CONCLUSION : In P01160 , overexpression of P25103 contributes to disturbance of neuropeptides loop , resulting in aggregation of neutrophilic granulocyte and promoting deterioration of lung injury . Linkage of cytokine genes to rheumatoid arthritis . Evidence of genetic heterogeneity . OBJECTIVE : To investigate linkage of candidate disease susceptibility genes to rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) in affected sibling pair families stratified for specific clinical features . METHOD : Two hundred RA affected sibling pair families were genotyped for informative microsatellite markers mapping within or less than 3cM from : P27352 alpha , P27352 gamma , P27352 beta , IL1 alpha , IL1 beta , P14778 , P60568 , P05231 , Q01344 , IL8R , P10415 , P29965 , NOS3 , P49279 , alpha 1 anti-trypsin , and alpha 1 anti-chymotrypsin , using fluorescence based automated technology . Linkage was examined by defining allele sharing sibling pairs . This was assessed by maximum likelihood-inheritance by descent methods . RESULTS : An increase in allele sharing was seen for Q01344 in female sibling pairs ( LOD 0.91 , p = 0.03 ) , for P27352 gamma in sibling pairs with an affected male ( LOD 0.96 , p = 0.03 ) and most significantly for P60568 in sibling pairs where one or both were persistently seronegative ( LOD 1.05 , p = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSION : Weak evidence of linkage of RA to Q01344 , IFN gamma , and P60568 has been detected in clinical subsets of sibling pairs suggesting that RA is a genetically heterogeneous disease . Comparison of imatinib , dasatinib , nilotinib and INNO-406 in imatinib-resistant cell lines . We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the P12931 family kinases ( SFKs ) of imatinib , dasatinib , nilotinib and INNO-406 . Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against P11274 - P00519 with little selectivity over SFKs . DB04868 exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors , but was highly specific for P00519 and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells . INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for P11274 - P00519 between that of dasatinib and nilotinib , and inhibited only SFKs P06239 and P07948 among SFKs . Both nilotinib and INNO-406 were potent inhibitors of the dasatinib-resistant T315A , F317L and F317V P11274 - P00519 mutations . Association between severe toxicity of nilotinib and P22309 polymorphisms in Japanese patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia . BACKGROUND : DB04868 is a P11274 - P00519 kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . The P22309 ( P22309 ) polymorphism P22309 *28 ( *28 ) /*28 has been linked to an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia in patients with CML who receive nilotinib . Beside *28 , P22309 *6 ( *6 ) is another important variant allele in Japanese patients because it is associated with adverse events of irinotecan , metabolized by P22309 . We retrospectively investigated the association between severe toxicity of nilotinib and P22309 polymorphisms ( *6 and*28 ) in Japanese patients with CML . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Eight patients with cytogenetically confirmed CML who were receiving nilotinib were studied to explore the association of P22309 polymorphisms with severe nilotinib-related toxicity . Genotyping analyses were determined for *6 and *28 . RESULTS : All 3 patients with the *6/*6 or *6/*28 genotype had severe toxicity , including QT interval prolongation ( grade 3 ) , elevated lipase levels ( grade 3 ) plus hyperbilirubinemia ( grade 2 ) , and anemia ( grade 3 ) plus hepatic cyst hemorrhage ( grade 2 ) in 1 patient each . Among the 5 patients with the *6/*1 or *1/*1 genotype , 1 had elevated lipase levels ( grade 3 ) and another had severe pain in the lower extremities ( grade 3 ) . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that P22309 polymorphisms are important determinants of severe toxicity of nilotinib in Japanese patients . Cooperative Hedgehog- P00533 signaling . It has been known for many years that cooperative interactions between oncogenes ( e.g. DB01367 , MYC , P10415 ) can fuel cancer growth ( 1-5 ) , but the restricted druggability of many of those interacting cancer genes has hampered translation of combined targeting to medical cancer therapy . The identification and characterization of cooperative cancer signaling pathways amenable to medical therapy is therefore a crucial step towards the establishment of efficient targeted combination treatments urgently needed to improve cancer therapy . Here we review recent findings of our group and colleagues on the molecular mechanisms of cooperative Hedgehog/ P08151 and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( P00533 ) signaling , two clinically relevant oncogenic pathways involved in the development of many human malignancies . We also discuss the possible implications of these findings for the design of a therapeutic regimen relying on combined targeting of key effectors of both pathways . [ DB00391 in the management of functional dyspepsia and delayed gastric emptying ] . DB00391 is a sulpiride isomer that exerts its prokinetic action through a dual mechanism : 1 ) as a P14416 antagonist and 2 ) as a serotonin 5HT(4) receptor agonist , conferring this drug with a cholinergic effect . At a dosage of 25mg three times daily , levosulpiride accelerates gastric and gallbladder emptying . Clinical trials have shown that this agent is more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of dyspepsia , while comparative studies have demonstrated that its effect is similar or superior to that of other dopamine antagonists . The safety profile of levosulpiride is good and the frequency of adverse events is similar to that of other D(2) dopamine antagonists . Therefore , this drug is a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with functional dyspepsia , as well as in those with delayed gastric emptying . DB04868 and MEK inhibitors induce synthetic lethality through paradoxical activation of RAF in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia . We show that imatinib , nilotinib , and dasatinib possess weak off-target activity against RAF and , therefore , drive paradoxical activation of P15056 and CRAF in a DB01367 -dependent manner . Critically , because DB01367 is activated by P11274 - P00519 , in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells , DB01367 activity persists in the presence of these drugs , driving paradoxical activation of P15056 , CRAF , MEK , and P29323 , and leading to an unexpected dependency on the pathway . Consequently , nilotinib synergizes with MEK inhibitors to kill drug-resistant CML cells and block tumor growth in mice . Thus , we show that imatinib , nilotinib , and dasatinib drive paradoxical RAF/MEK/ P29323 pathway activation and have uncovered a synthetic lethal interaction that can be used to kill drug-resistant CML cells in vitro and in vivo . That which does not kill me makes me stronger ; combining P27361 /2 pathway inhibitors and BH3 mimetics to kill tumour cells and prevent acquired resistance . Oncogenic mutations in DB01367 or P15056 can drive the inappropriate activation of the P27361 /2 . In many cases , tumour cells adapt to become addicted to this deregulated P27361 /2 signalling for their proliferation , providing a therapeutic window for tumour-selective growth inhibition . As a result , inhibition of P27361 /2 signalling by P15056 or Q02750 /2 inhibitors is an attractive therapeutic strategy . Indeed , the first P15056 inhibitor , vemurafenib , has now been approved for clinical use , while clinical evaluation of Q02750 /2 inhibitors is at an advanced stage . Despite this progress , it is apparent that tumour cells adapt quickly to these new targeted agents so that tumours with acquired resistance can emerge within 6-9 months of primary treatment . One of the major reasons for this is that tumour cells typically respond to P15056 or Q02750 /2 inhibitors by undergoing a P55008 cell cycle arrest rather than dying . Indeed , although inhibition of P27361 /2 invariably increases the expression of pro-apoptotic P10415 family proteins , tumour cells undergo minimal apoptosis . This cytostatic response may simply provide the cell with the opportunity to adapt and acquire resistance . Here we discuss recent studies that demonstrate that combination of P15056 or Q02750 /2 inhibitors with inhibitors of pro-survival P10415 proteins is synthetic lethal for P27361 /2-addicted tumour cells . This combination effectively transforms the cytostatic response of P15056 and Q02750 /2 inhibitors into a striking apoptotic cell death response . This not only augments the primary efficacy of P15056 and Q02750 /2 inhibitors but delays the onset of acquired resistance to these agents , validating their combination in the clinic .

The MYC proto-oncogene has long been implicated in the control of normal cell growth and its deregulation is associated with the development of neoplasia . The MYC protein has a well-established role as a component of signal-transduction pathways promoting both proliferation and apoptosis . Because signalling pathways that drive cell death and cell proliferation are so tightly coupled , a synergy between genetic lesions leading to suppression of cell death and those promoting cell proliferation is observed during carcinogenesis . We discuss such synergy with respect to the cooperating oncogenes MYC , DB01367 and P10415 . [ The involvement of c-Abl and D40 ( Q8NG31 / Q8NG31 ) proteins in the regulation of cell proliferation and cancer ] . Although c-Abl and D40 proteins are localized predominantly in nucleus , they are involved in different cellular processes . c-Abl is a tyrosine-kinase that takes part in protein phosphorylation on tyrosine . Recently D40 has been identified as a component of outer kinetochore complex . Despite of functional differences between c-Abl and D40 proteins , they have some similarities . First , high expression levels of c-Abl and D40 were observed not only in proliferating somatic cells , such as tumors , but also in healthy human testis . The increased expression levels of c-Abl and D40 protein in spermatocytes and acrosome of spermatids indicate their role in meiosis and spermatogenesis . Second , both proteins interact with specific regions of chromatin and are involved in the regulation of cell growth and division . Third , P00519 and D40 ( Q8NG31 ) genes are involved in chromosomal translocations that subsequently form chimeric oncoproteins P11274 - P00519 , P41212 - P00519 and Q03164 - Q8NG31 in human leukaemia . Finally , both proteins interact with the tumor suppressor P06400 protein and subsequently can lead to regulation of the cell proliferation . The possible regulatory pathways that are controlled by c-Abl and D40 proteins are described here in details . Complementation by P10415 and C-HA- DB01367 oncogenes in malignant transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts . The P10415 ( B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 ) and C-HA- DB01367 oncogenes encode membrane-associated proteins of 26 and 21 kilodaltons , respectively . Although DB01367 proteins have long been known for their ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP , recent investigations suggest that P10415 encodes a novel GTP-binding protein ( S. Haldar , C. Beatty , Y. Tsujimoto , and C. M. Croce , Nature [ London ] 342:195-198 , 1989 ) . Cotransfection of P10415 and HA- DB01367 oncogenes resulted in morphological transformation of early-passage rodent fibroblasts , rendering these cells tumorigenic in animals and enabling them to grow in semisolid medium . In contrast , cotransfection of P10415 with oncogenes that encode nuclear proteins ( E1A and C-MYC ) did not produce malignant transformation , whereas HA- DB01367 did complement with these genes . These findings suggest that proteins encoded by oncogenes such as P10415 and HA- DB01367 , although having similar subcellular locations and perhaps similar biochemical properties , can regulate distinct complementary pathways involved in cellular transformation . DB00104 and the novel multireceptor ligand somatostatin receptor agonist pasireotide ( DB06663 ) block the adrenalectomy-induced increase in mitotic activity in male rat anterior pituitary . The novel somatostatin receptor agonist pasireotide binds with high affinity to somatostatin receptors P30872 , 2 , 3 , and 5 . Acting principally through the latter , it inhibits basal and P06850 -stimulated DB01285 secretion from the AtT20 corticotroph cell line and DB01285 release from a proportion of human corticotroph adenomas both in vitro and in vivo . Data supporting an additional antiproliferative effect has led to pasireotide being explored as a potential therapy for patients with Cushing 's disease . We have compared the effects of pasireotide and octreotide on adrenalectomy-induced mitotic and apoptotic activity in the male rat anterior pituitary . Adrenalectomized rats were treated with daily sc injections of vehicle , pasireotide , or octreotide . Changes in proliferation and apoptosis were determined 2-6 d postoperatively . DB06663 and octreotide had no effect on baseline pituitary cell turnover and no measurable effects on apoptosis . However , the wave of increased mitotic activity normally seen in the pituitary after adrenalectomy was completely abolished . Nevertheless , pasireotide and octreotide did not diminish the increase in DB01285 -immunopositive cell index after adrenalectomy , indicating that cell division and differentiation of hormonally null cells in the pituitary are under independent control . In conclusion , basal cell turnover in the pituitary is not inhibited by pasireotide or octreotide . Bilateral adrenalectomy stimulates differentiation of preexisting null cells into DB01285 -positive cells . Cell division after bilateral adrenalectomy occurs in a specific subpopulation of hormonally null cells that are equally sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of pasireotide and octreotide , implicating P30874 receptors in this antimitotic response . Contribution of the kidney to metabolic clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide . To quantify the role of the kidney in whole body metabolic clearance rate ( P08235 ) from plasma of atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , synthetic alpha-human P01160 -(1-28) was infused at 200 ng/min to steady-state conditions in chronically instrumented one-kidney conscious dogs . Clearances were measured in dogs with a normally filtering kidney and they were also measured after the glomerular filtration rate ( Q92565 ) was reduced to close to zero by acutely inflating a cuff around the renal artery ( P31749 ) , which resulted in minimal urine production and renal blood flow reduction to 59 % of the resting level . In normal dogs , P08235 was 1,090 +/- 134 ml/min with renal clearance rate ( RCR ) contributing only 13.9 % . After P31749 , P08235 fell to 864 +/- 151 ml/min , due in part to a fall in RCR ( -41.5 +/- 12.9 ml/min ) , but mostly due to a fall in " rest of the body " ( total renal ) clearance of P01160 . The reduced Q92565 accounted for virtually all the fall in RCR . Normal plasma P01160 half-life was 59.6 +/- 7.9 s . In conclusion , P08235 of P01160 was very high , approaching the cardiac output , suggesting that most of P01160 is cleared in one circulation through peripheral tissues . Q92565 contributed significantly to RCR ( approximately 30 % ) but the contribution of the kidney to whole body P08235 was small relative to rest of the body clearance of P01160 . Epidermal growth factor enhances androgen receptor‑mediated bladder cancer progression and invasion via potentiation of AR transactivation . P10275 ( AR ) plays a critical role in bladder cancer ( BCa ) development . Our early studies found AR knock-out mice ( with few androgens and deleted AR ) failed to develop BCa , yet 50 % of castrated mice ( with few androgens and existing AR ) still developed BCa in an N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine ( BBN ) carcinogen-induced BCa mouse model , suggesting the existing AR in BCa of castrated mice may still play important roles in promoting BCa development at the castration level of androgens . The mechanism underlying this and/or which factors potentiate AR function at the castration level of androgen remains unclear . Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) , a key player in BCa progression , has been demonstrated to be able to potentiate AR transactivation in prostate cancer . In the present study , we found that P01133 could increase BCa cell growth , migration and invasion in the presence of AR under the low amount of androgen and P01133 was able to potentiate AR transactivation through P00533 by activating PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway at castration androgen level . The increased suppression effects by P00533 inhibitor of PD168393 on AR function after addition of anti-androgen , DB01128 , further suggested AR might play a key role in the effects of P01133 on BCa progression and metastasis . Collectively , our results indicate that P01133 may be able to potentiate AR transactivation that leads to enhancing BCa progression , which may help us to develop a better therapeutic approach to treat BCa via targeting both P01133 and AR signaling . MYC directs transcription of Q07820 and P06730 genes to control sensitivity of gastric cancer cells toward HDAC inhibitors . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) control fundamental physiological processes such as proliferation and differentiation . HDAC inhibitors ( HDACi ) induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells . Therefore , they represent promising cancer therapeutics that appear particularly useful in combination therapies . Although HDACi are tested in current clinical trials , the molecular mechanisms modulating the cellular responses toward HDACi are incompletely understood . To gain insight into pathways that limit HDACi efficacy in gastric cancer , we treated a panel of gastric cancer cells with the clinically relevant HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( DB02546 ) . We report that higher expression levels of the anti-apoptotic P10415 family members Q07820 and BCL(XL) were detectable in cells with high inhibitory concentration 50 ( IC(50) ) values for DB02546 . Using RNAi , we show that Q07820 and BCL(XL) lower the efficacy of DB02546 . To find strategies to interfere with Q07820 and BCL(XL) expression , we investigated molecular regulation of both proteins . We show that specific siRNAs against c-MYC as well as pharmacological inhibition of this cancer-relevant transcription factor reduced Q07820 and BCL(XL) expression . Subsequently , we observed an increase in DB02546 efficacy . Our data furthermore demonstrate that two different molecular mechanisms are responsible for the modulation of these factors . Whereas c-MYC controls transcription of Q07820 directly , regulation of BCL(XL) was due to c-MYC 's capability to regulate the P06730 gene , which encodes a rate-limiting factor of eukaryotic translation . Our data reveal a new molecular mechanism for how c-MYC controls cell autonomous apoptosis and provide a rationale for a concerted inhibition of HDACs and c-MYC in gastric cancer . Expression of P10721 and P09619 is associated with a good prognosis in neuroblastoma . BACKGROUND : The clinical outcome of neuroblastoma ( NB ) depends on age , stage , and P04198 amplification . Receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) promote cell growth , migration , and metastasis in cancer cells , including NB . However , the correlation of the expression profile of RTKs with prognosis in NB remains controversial . PROCEDURE : Expression and mutation analysis of P10721 , P09619 , P36888 , P07949 , and P04629 mRNAs were performed in 24 NB cell lines and 40 tumor samples using RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing . Immunohistochemical analysis of P10721 and P09619 protein expression was also examined in 38 paraffin sections of NB tumor samples . RESULTS : The expression of P10721 , PDGFRbeta , and P36888 mRNA was associated with NB in patients under 1 year ( P < 0.02 ) and P04629 expression ( P < 0.001 ) . The loss of expression of these kinases was associated with P04198 amplification ( P < 0.02 ) and advanced stages of disease in patients over 1 year of age ( P < 0.005 ) . PDGFRalpha mRNA expression was detected in all cell lines and tumor samples , and P07949 mRNA expression was not associated with any clinical parameters . Immunohistochemistry results showed the similar findings . We did not find any activating mutations in P10721 , P09619 , P36888 , or P07949 . Notably , the GNNK(-) isoform of P10721 was predominant in all cell lines and clinical samples . CONCLUSION : Expression of P10721 , PDGFRbeta , and P36888 was associated with a good prognosis in NB . The loss of expression of these RTKs might correlate to the disease progression of NB .
